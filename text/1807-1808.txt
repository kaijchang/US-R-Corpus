brought to the point so long desired : Burr guaranties the result with his

The day after my arival at this city, the 26th of November last, I reaeived another letteFfiom the doctor, of which the following is a correct cbpy.
".?New-Orleans, .Mmember 25, 1806.

"SIR,.
"Your letter of the 16th inst. has been duly received ; supposing that you will be much engaged this mcruing, I defer waiting on your excellency till you will be pleased to inform me of the time when it will be convenient to you to see me.

"I remain with great respect, " Your excellency's most obedient servant, "EUCK BOLLAIAN.
"His excellency gen. WILKINSON, Fauxbourg."

.Zl'rigzy, The house between Mfadame Trevigne and Ml. Mfacarty.
On the 30th of the same month I waited in person on doctor 1. Bollman, when he informed me that he had not heard from colonel Burr since hi arrival here. That he (the said doctor E. Bolhnan) had sent dispatches to colonel Burr by a lieutenant Spence, of the navy, and that he had been advised of Spence's arrival at Nashville, in the state of Tennessee, and observed that colonel Burr had proceeded too far to retreat; that he (colonel Burr) had numerous and powerful friends in-the United States, who stood pledged to support him with their fortunes, and that he must succeed. That he (the said doctor E. Bollman) had written to colonel Burr on the subject of provisions, and that he expected a supply would be sent front New-York, and also from Norfolk, where colonel Burr had strong connections. I did not see or hear from the doctor again until the 5th inst. when I called on him the second time. The mail having arrived the day before, 1 asked him whether he had received any intelligence from colonel Burr ; he informed me that he had seen a letter from colonel Burr, of the 30th October, in which he (colonel Burr) gave assurances that he should be at Natchez with 2,000 men on the 20th December, inst. where he should wait until he heard from this place ; that he would be followed by 4,000 men more, and that he (colonel Burr) if he had chosen, could have raised or got 12,000 as easily u 6,000, but that he did not think that number necessary. Confiding fully in this information, I became indifferent about further disguise. I then told the doctor that I should most certainly oppose colonel Burr if he came this way. He replied that they must come here for rqui/niewts and Chiltping, and observed that lie did not know what had passed between colonql Burr and myself, obliqued at a sham defence, and waived the subject.
From the documents in my possession and the several communications, verbal as we!' as written, from te said doctor Frick Bollman, on this subject, I feel no hesitation in declaring under tho solemn obligation of an oatl,

I instantly resolved to avail myself of the reference made to the, bearer, and in the course of some days, drew from him (the said Swartwout) the following disclosure : "That he had been dispatched by coldnel Burr from Philadelphia, had passed. through the states of Ohio ad Kentucky, and proceeded from Louisville for St. Louis, where he expected to find me, but discovering at Kaskaskias that I had descended the river, he procured a skifr, hired hands, and followed me down the Mississippi to Fort Adams, and from thence set out for Natchitoches, in company with captains Sparks and Hooke, under the pretence of 6 disposition to take part in the campaign against the Spaniards, then depending. That colonelBurr witl the support of a powerful
association;extending from New-York to New-Orleans, was levying n armed body of 7,000 men from the state of New-York and the western states and territories, with a view to carry an expedition against the Mexican provinces, and
that 50d men under colonel Swartwout and a colonel or major Tyler, were to descend the Alleghany, for whose accommodation light boats had been built and were ready." I inquired what would be their course : he said, It this territory would be revolutionized, where the people were ready, to join
them) and that there would be some seizing, lie supposedl, at New-Orleans ; that they expected to be ready to embark about the first of February, and intended to land at Vera Cruz, and to march front thence to Mexico." I observed that there were several millions of clollars in the bntik of this place ; to which he replied, "WWe know it full well ;" and on .remarking that they certainly did not mean to violate privaie property, he said they 11merely meant to borrow, and-would return it; that they must equip tlemselves in New-Orleans ; that they expected naval pfotection from Great Britain ; that the capt. - and, the officers of our avy 'were so disgusted with the government that they were ready to join ; that similar disgustsprevailed throughout the western country, where the peopiq were zealous in favour of the enterprise, and that pilot boat built schnoners were contracted for along our southern coast for their service; that he had been accompanied from the falls of Ohio to Kaskaskias, and from thence to Fart Adams. by -

Though determined to deceive hiin if possible, i could not refrain tein[ Mr. Swartwout it was impossible that I could ever dishonour my commdsaon, and I believe I duped him b; my admiration of the plan, and by observing

!& following are the depositions made in open curt, and alluded to in the f rejoing statement:
THE DEPOSITION OF WILLIAM EATON, ESQ.

Early last winter, cal Aaron Burr, late vice-president of the United States, signified to me, at this place, that, under the authority of the general government, he was organizing a secret expedition against the Spanish province on our south-western borders, which expedition he was to lead, and In which ho wts authorised to invite me to take the command of a division. I -had never beforebeen made personally acquainted with colBurr; and, having formany years been employed in foreign service, I knew.but little about the estimation this gentleman now held in the opinion of his countrymen and his government; the rank and confidence by which he had so lately been distinguished left me no right to suspect his patriotism. I knew him -a soldier. In case oE a wvar with the Spanish nation, which from the tenor of the president's message to both houses of congress seemed probable, I should have thought it my duty to obey so honourable a call of my country ; and, under that impression, I dil engage to embark in the expedition. I had frequent interviews with col Burr in this city-and, f6ra considerable time, his object seemed to be to instruct me by maps,.and other information, the feasibility of penetrating to Mexico--always carrying forward theidea that the measure was authorised by government. Atlength, some time in Februaij, he began by degrees to unveil himself. ,He reproached the government with want of character, want of gratitude, and want ofJustice. He geemed desirous of irritating resentment in my breast, by dilating-'n certain injuries he felt I had suffered from reflections made on the floor of the house of representatives concerning my operations in Barbary, and from the delays of government in adjusting my clalni for disbursements on that coast during my consular agency at Tunis-; and he said he would point me to an honourable mode of indemnity.

entertain a suspicion that Mr. Burr was projecting an unauthorised military expedition, which, to me,was enveloped in mystery ; and, desirous to draw an explanation from him, I suffered him to suppose me resigned to his counsel He now laid open his project of revoluti6nising the western country, separating it from the union, establishing a monarchy there, of which he was to be the sovereign, 'and New-Orleans to be his capital ; organising a force on the waters of the Mississipi, ailld extending conquest toMexico. I suggested a number of impedihnents to his scheme-such as the republican habits of the citizeus of that country, and their affection towards our present administration of government ; the want of funds; the resistance lie would meet from the reguhtr army of thd United States'on those frontiers ; and the opposition of Miranda, in ase he should succeed to republicanise the Mexicans.
Mr. Burr found no difficulty in removing these obstacles-he said he had, the preceding season, made a tour through that country, and had secured the attachment of the principal citizens of Kentucky, Tennessee, and Loul'slnal, to his person and his measures ; 4eclared he had' iniexhaustible resources to funds ; assured me the regular army would act with him, and would be reinforced by ten or twelve thousand men from the above mentioned states ani territory, and from other parts of the union ; said lie had"powerful agents in the Spanish territory; and, as for Miranda, said Mr. Burr, we must hang Miranda. He now proposed to give me the second coinmand in his army. I asked him who shbuld have the chief conmand ? He said, Gzneral Wilkin.on. I observed it was singular that he should count on general Wilkinson; the elevated rank and high trust he now held as commander in chief of our army and governc r of a province, he would hardly put at hazard for any precarious prospect%. of aggrandizement. Mr. Burr said, general Wilkinson balanced. iithe confidence of government, was doubtful of retaining much longer the considei'ation lid now enjoyed, and ,was consequently prepared to secure twhimself a permanency I asked Mr.Burr jf he knew general Wilkinson ? He anzwered.yes, and echoed the questi on;. I said Iknow hm well. " What do you know of him ?" said Mr. Burr. I k4iow, I replied, that general Wilkinson will act as lieutenant to no iiian in exisfence. "You ar in an error," sgid Mr. Burr ; " Wilkinson 'wiltact a&lieutenant to me." From the tenor of repeated conversations with Mr. Burr, I was induced to beldtvo tie plan of separating the union, which lie had contemplated, had been communicated to and approved of by general Wilkinsoi ; (though I now suspect it an artful argument of seduction ;) and he often expressed a full confidence that the general's influence, the offerof double.pay and double k'ations, the prospect of plunder, and the ambition of achievement, would draw the army Into his measures. Mr. Burr talked of the establishment of an independent government west of the Alleghanyas a matter of inherent constitutional right of the people, a ciange which -wouldeventually take place, and for the operation of which the present crisis was peculiarly favourable. There was, said he, no energy in the government.to be dreaded, and the divisions of political opinions throughout the union was a circumstance of which we should profit. There were very many enterprising men among us, who aspired td sumethin beyond the dull pursuits of civil life, and who would volunteer in this enterprise, and. the vast territofy belonging, to the UnitedStates, w'hih ofered to adventurers, and the mines of Mexico, would bring strength to his standard from all quarters. I lis'tened to the expositiob of colonelBurr's views with seeming.acqul-

eseence. Every interview convinced memoreand more that he had organized a deep laid Viot bf treasbn in thewesti in the aqcomplishdient of which hb felt fully confident. Till, at length, I discovered that hi§ ambition was not bounded by the waters df.the Mississippi and Mexico, but that he meditated overthrowing thi present government of our country, He said, if he.cduld gain
over the marine corps, and secure the naval commanders, Truxton, Preble,
Decatur, and others, he would turn Congressneckhand hee& od of doora, a&sass nate the Pesident,&eizeon the treasuryand the navy, and declarehimself the'iprotectorofan encergetitgovernment. The honourable trust of corrupting the marine corps, and of sounding commodore Preble and captain Decatur, colonel Bur proposed confiding to me. Shocked at this proposition, I
dropped the mask, and exclaimed against his views. He talked of the degratled situation of our country, and the necessity of- a blow by which its energy and its dignity should 6~e restored-said, if that blow could be struck here ut this time, he was confiaent of the support of the best blood of America. I told colonel Burr he deceived himself in presuing that he, or any other inm,
Could excite a party in this country who would countenance hinI in such a plot of despeatibn, murder and treason. 'He replied,-thathe, perhaps, kniew 4et-
ter the dispositions of theinfluential" citizens of this rountry than I did. I told him one solitary-word. would destroy him. He asked, what word? Ianswer-
d, Usurper.! He smiled at my hesitation, and quoted some great examples. in his favour. I observed to him, that I had lately travelled from one extreme of the union to theother; and, though I found a diversity of political opinion
among the people, they appeared united at the most distant aspect of national danger. That, for the section of the union to which I belonged, I would vouch, should he succeed in the first instance here, he would within six weeks afterward have his throat-cut by Yankee militia.

Thoughwild and'extravagant Mt. Burr's last project, and though fraught with premeditated slaughter, I felt very easy on the subject, because its de-
feat he had depositedin my own hands. I did not feel so secure concerning that of disjointing the union. But the very interesting and embarirasing situation in which his communications placed me, left me, I confess, at it stand to know
how to conduct, myself with propriety. ,He had committed no overt act of aggression against law, I could draw nothing from him in writing, nor. could I learn that he had exposed his plans to any person near me, by whom my
testimony could be supiorted. He had mentioned to me no persons who were principaly and decidedly engaged with him, except general Wilkinson, a Mr.
Alston,'who I found was his son-in-law, and a Mr. Ephraim Kibby, lateacaptain of rangers in general Wayne's army. Satisfied that Mr. Burr was resolute in pushing his project of rebellion in the west of the Allegliany, and apprehensive that it was too well and too extensively organized to be easily suppressed; though I dreaded the weight of his character when laid in the banancq
against my solitary assertion, I brought myself to the resolution to endeaovir to defeat it by getting him removed from among us, or to expose myself to all
onsequence- by a disclosure of his intentions. Accordingly; I waited on the President of the United States; and after some desultory" conversation, in -which I aimed to draw iis view to the westward,* I used the freedom to say to the President I th6ught Mr. Burr should be sent out of this country, and gae for reason that I believed him dangerous in it. The President askdd where he
shouldhesent? I mentioned London and Cadiz. The President thought the

466

APPEND IX.

trust too impoirtant, and seemed to entertain a doubt of Mr. Burr' Integrity. I intimated that no one, perhaps, had strongergrounds to mistrust Mr. Burr'o moral integrity, than myself;' yet, I believed, ambition so much predominated over lin, that, when placed on an eminence and put on his honour, respect to
himself would insure his fidelity:. His talents were unquestionable. I perceived te subject was disagreeable to the President; and to give it the shortest course to the poin , declared my concern that if Mr. Burr wlere not in some
way daftosed-of, we should, within eighteenmonths, have an insurrection, if
not a revolution, on the wUaters ofthe ississiplii. The President answered, that he had too much confidence in the information, the intepity, and the attachment to the union, of the citizens of that country, to admit an alpirehension of'the kind. I am happy that events prove this confidence well placed, As nointerrogatories followed my expression of alarm, I thought silence on the subject, at that time and place, became me. But I detailed, about the same
time, the whole projects of Mr. Burr to certain members of congress. Th1cy believed colonel Burr capable of any thing, and agreed that the fellow ought
-to be hanged; but thought his projects too chimerical, and his circumstances
too desperate, to give the subject the merit of serious consideration. The total security of feeling in those to whom I had rung the tocsin, induced mc to suspect my own apprehensions unseasonable, or at least too deeply admitted; and, of qourse, I grew indifferent about the subject.

Mr. Burr's visits to me became less ftequcnt, and his conversation less famijiar. He appearedto have abandoned the idea of a general revolption, but
seemed determined on that of the Mississippi ; aid, although I could perceive symptoms of distrust in him towards me, he manifested great solicitude to engage me with him in the enterprise. Weary' of his importunity, and at once tp convince him of my serious attachnents, I gave the following toast to the public :--The Unzted States-Palsy to the brain that should plot to dismembee, and leprosy to the hand that will not draw to defend our union

I doubt whether the sentiment was better understood by any of my acquaintance than colonelBurr. Our intercourse ended here ; we met but Feloom nfo terward. I returned to my farm in Massachusetts, add'thought no more of
Mr. Burr, norhis empire, tillspmetime latein September or beginning of October, When a letter from Morrig Belknap, of Marietta, to Timothy E. Daniel., sbia; fell into my hands at Brimfield, which satisfied me that Mr. Burrhdd ac. tually commenced Iis preparatory operation's on the Ohio. I now spokepub. licly of the fact-transtitted a copy of the letter front Belknap to the depart-
ment of state, and about the same time forwarded,, through the hands of the post-master general, to the President of the UnitedStates, a.statement in substance of what is here above detailed concerning the Mississippi conspiracy of the said colonel Aaron Bun', Which is said to have been the first formal intel-
ligence received by the executive on the subject of the conspirator being in
motion.

I know not whether my country will allow me the merit of correctness of conduct in this affair. The novelty of the duty might, perhaps1 have enibarfassed stronger minds than mine. The uprightnessf my intentions I hope will

not be questioned.

DiEPOSITION"OF JAM'iES L.

On this occasion,-his deponent received in confidence from general Wilkinson Informatior to the following purport : that the general had undoubted and indisputable evidence of a treasonable design formed by Aaron Butrr and others to dismember the union, by a separation of the western states and teiritories from the Atlantic states ; that New-Orleans was in immediate danger, and that he had concluded a hasty compromise with the Spaniards, so as to be able to withdraw his troops instantly to this the immediate object of attack and. great vulnerable point; that he had received a letter from Burr holding forth great inducements to him to become a party, of which he showed me the original in cyphe, and another written paper purporting to be a decyphered copy of the letter., He expressel great indignation at-the plot, and surprise that one so well acquainted with him as Burr should dare to make to him so degrading a proposal, and declared his determination of defeating the enterprise, or perishing in the attempt. He observed in addition that there vere many agents of Mr. Burr then in the town,.who had already been assiduous in their visits, and towards whom he was determined to act with cautious ambiguity, so as at the same time to become possessed of the whole extent of the-plan, the persons engaged, and the time of its execution, and alpo to prevent any attempt on his person, of which he declared he had serious apprehensions. Of the number of these agents he was not aware# .but mentioned the names of two of whom he was certain, Messrs. Bollnian and Alexander. From time to time, as this deponent had interviews with general Wilkinson, he informed this deponent tbat he had received additional information respecting the movements and designs of Buty by means of these-agents, of whom he considered Bollman as the principal.' In the

kinson in the copying bf certain papers- and documents, and preparing 00tain dispatches for the general government, which the general intned 'to foifward by the brig Thetis.- While thus employed at -the general's lodgings, this dieponent has remarked upon two different 6ccasions, a person knock for admittance at a-door with a window in it opposite the table where this deponent was sitttng, who, this deponent was informed by gedei'al Wilkinson
was doctor Bollman. Upon these occasions the general'has suddenly risen from his seat, and accompanied this person in a number of tutis up and
down a balcony in the front of the house, apparently engaged in deep. conversation. Up on the latter of these occasions the general, on his 'return into
the chamber said to this deponent, "that is doctor Bollmap; his infatuation is truly extraordinary ; he persists in'his belief that I am with Burr, and has this moment shewn me a letter from the latter, in which he says that he Is to be at Natchez on the 20ti December with 2,000 men, that 4,000 will fol-
low.in the course of a few days, and that he could with the same ease, have procured .double that number." General Wilkinson then observed, that he had obtained all the information he wanted, and that the affair would not be kept much longer a secret from the public.

When this deponent left the city of New-Orleans, the inhabitants of that city were in a state of great alarm, and apprehended a serious attack from Mr. Burr and his confederates ; this depoiient understood that mercantile business wds much embarrassed_ and-great fears were entertained of con. siderable.comme~cial failures in consequence of the embargo which had
been'imposed ; that general Wilkinson was taking strong measureQ of et'ence, and that 400 persons were tlien actually engaged in the fortifications of ;the city.

OPINj0ON ON THE MOTION TO INTRODUCF41RTAIN EVIDENCE IN THE TRIAL.
OF AARON BURR, FOR TREASON) PRONOUNCEr MONDAY. AUGUST 31.
TIAE question now to be decided has been argued in a manner worthy of Its imnportince," and with an earnestness evincing the strong. conviction felt bv the counsel on each side that.the law is"with them.
A degree of eloquence seldom displayed on any occasion has embellished a solidity of argument and a depth of research by whibh the court has been greatly aide4 in forming the opinion it is about to deliver.
The testimony. adduced on the part of the United States, to prove the overt act laid in the indictment, having shown, and the attorney for the United States having admitted, that the prisoner was not present when the act, whatever may be its character, was committed, and there being no reason to doubt but that he was at a great distance and in a different state, it is object,ed to the testimony offered on the part of the United States, to connect him with those who committed the overt act, that su*ch testimony is totally irrelevant and must therefore be rejected.
The arguments in support of this motion respect in part the merits of the ,ase as it-may be supposed to stand independent of the pleadings, and In part as exhibited by the pleadings.
On the first division of the subject two points are made 1st. That conformably to tue constitution of the United Sttates, no mun can be convicted of treason who was not present when the war was levied. 2d. That if this construction be erroneous, no testimrony can be received to charge one man with the overt acts of btlers, until those overt acts to laid in the indictment be. proved .to the satisfaction of the court.

APPENDIX.

The question which- arises on the construction of the constitution, in every "point of view in which it can be contemplated, is of infinite Muoment to the people of this country and to their'government, and requires the most temperate and the most deliberate consideration.

".Treason against the United States shall consist only in levying war against them"

What is the natural import of the words I( levying war ?" And who iay he said to levy it ? Had their first application to treason been made by our constitution, they would certainly have admitted of some latitude of construction. Taken most literally, they are perhaps of the same import with the words raising or creating war, buf as those who join after the commencement are equaDly the objects of punishment, there would probably be a general admission, -that the term Adso comprehended making war, or carrying on war. In the construction which courts would be required to give these word, it is not improbable that those who should raise, create ini~ke, or carry on war might be comprehended. The various acts wbich would be considared as coming within the'term, would be settkd by a course of decisions, and it would be affirming boldly, to say that those only who actually constituted a portion of the military force appearing in arms could be consihered as levying war. There is no difficulty in affirming that there must be a war, or the crime of levying it cannot exist; but there would often be considerable difficulty in affirming that a particular act did or did not involve the person committing it in the gpilt anq h the fact of levying war. If for example, an army should be actually raised for the avowed purpose of carrying on open war against the United States and subverting their gbvernment, the point must be weighed very deliberately' before a judge woula venture to decide that an overt act of levying war had not been committed by a commissary of purchases, who -never saw the army, but who, knowing its object, and leaguing himself with the rebels, supplied that army with provisions, or by a recruiting officer holding a commission in the rebel service, who though never in camp, executed the particular dQty assigned to him.

But the term is not for the first time applied to treason by the constitution of the United States. It is a technical term. It is used in a very old statute of that country, whose language is our language, and whose laws form the substratum of out laws. It is scarcely conceivable that the terd was not employed by the framers of our constitution in the sense which had been affixed to it by those from whom we borrowed it. So far as the meaning of any terms, particularly terms of art, is completely ascertained, those by whom they are employed must be considered as employing them in that ascertained meaning, unless the contrary beproved by the context. It istherefore r.easonable to suppose, unless it be incompatible with other expressions of the constitution, that the term "levying war," is used in that instrumedlt in the same sense in which it was understood in England and in this country, to have been used in the statute of the 25th of Edward Ill. from which it was borrowed.
It is said that this meaning is to be collected only from adjudged cases. But

this position cannot be conceded to the extent in winch it is laid down. The

VoL IV.

472.

APPENDIX.

superior aufhority of adjudged cases will never b& controverted. But those celebrated elementary writers who have siated the principles of thp law, ,*hose statement's have received the common approbation -of legal men, are
not to be disregarded. Principles laid down by such writers as Coke, Hale, V'oster, and Blackstone, are not lightly to be rejected. These books are fitrhe hands of every student., Legal opinions are formed upon them) and those opinions are afterwards carried to the bar, the behch, and the legislature. In the exposition of terms, therefore, used in instruments of the present day, the definitions and., the dicta of those authors, if not contradicted by adjudications, and if-compatible with the words of the statute, are entitled to respect. It isto be regretted that they do not hed as mtich lIzht on this part of the subject as is to be wished.

"Coke doesnot give a complete definition of the term, but puts cases which amount to levying war. " An actual rebellion or insurrectiol' h6 says, "-I a levying of war." In whom ? Coke does not say whether in those only who appear in arms, or in all those who tak part-in the rebellion or.insurrection by real open deed.
Hale, in treating on the same subject, puts: many cases which shall constitute a levying of war, without' which, no act can amount to treason, but he does not particularize the parts to be performed by the different persons concerned in that war, which shall be sufficiejit to fix on ca~h'the guilt of levying it.
Foster says, " the joinidg hith rebels in an act ot rebellion, or with enemies in.acts of hostility, will make a man a traitor." "9'Furnishing rebels or enemies with mboney, -arms, ammunition, or other necebsaries willipinta facie make a man a traitor."

Foster does not say that he. would be 'atraitor under the words of th, statute, independent of the legal rule which attaches the guilt of the principal to an accessary, nor that his treason is occasioned by that rule. In Englahnd this discrimination need not be made except for the purpose of framing the indictment, and tlierefo ie inthe English books we do not perceive any effort to make it. Thus surrendering a castle to rebels; being In confederacy-with-them is said by Hale and Foster to be treason under the claus6 cf'levying war, but whether it be levying war in fact, or aiding those who levy it is not aid. Upon this'point Blackstone is not more satisfactdry. .AIthough we may find among the commentators upon treason enough to satis* the ipquiry, what is a state of internal ivar ? yet no precise informntion can be acqbired from them which would enable - us to decide with clearness whether persons not in arms, but taking part in a rebellionj could be said to levy war independent of that doctrine which attaches to th accessary the guilt of his principal.
If in adjudged cases this question has been taken up and directly decided, the court has not seen those cases. The arguments whioh may be drawn froai the form of the indictment, though strong, are not conclusive. In the precedent found in Tremaine; Mary Speake, who'was indicted for furnishing provisions to the party of the Duke of Monmouth, i indicted for fur"nishilg provisions td those who were levying-war, not for levying war herself. It may correctly be argued, that had this act amounted to levying wari,

APPENDIX.
satwh ould have been indicted fdr levying war, and the furnishing of provisions would have been laid as the overt act. The court felt this when thr precedent was produced. But the argument, though strong, is not conclu ive, because in England, the inquiry whether she had become a traitor by levying war, or by giving aid and comfort to those who were levying war, was une important, and because, too, it does not appear from the indictment that she was actually concerned in the rebellion, that she belonged to the rebel party, or was guilty of any thing fhrther than a criminal speculation in kelling them provisions.
It is not deemed necessary to trace the doctrine that in treason all are _rincipals, to its source. Its origin is most probably stated correctly by :udge Tacker, in a work, the merit of which is with pleasure acknowledged. But if a spurious doctrine has.been introduced into the comman law, and has for centuries been admitted as genuine, it would require great hardihood in a judge to reject it. Accordingly, we find those o tha English jurists who seem to. disapprove the principle, declaring that it is now too firmly settled to be shaken.
It is unnecessary to trace this doctrine 'to its sburce for another reasrb The terms of the constitution comprise no questidn respecting principal and accessary, so far as either may be truly an& in fact said to levy war : Vhcther in England a person wotild be indicted in express terms for levylag war, or for assisting others in"levying war, yet if, in correct and legal language, he can be said to have levied war, and if it has never been decided that the act would not amount to levying war, his case may without violent construction be brought within the letter and the plain meaning of,the constitution.
In examining these words, the argument which may be drawn from felo. nies, as for example, from murder, is not more conclusive. Murder is the single act. of killing with'malice aforethought. But war is a complex operation composed of many parts, co-operating with each other. No one man or body of men can perform them all if the war be of any continuance. Although, then, in correct and in law language, he alone is said to havd mur. dered another who has perpetrated the fact, of killing, or has been present aiding that fact, .it doeh not.follo- that he alone can have levied war who hashorne arms. All those who perform th& Yarious and essential military parts of prosecuting the war which must be assigned to different persons, may with correctness ana accuracy be said to levy war.
Taking this view cif the subject, itappears to the court, that these who perforn) a part in the prosecution of the war may correctly be said to levy war and to commit treason under the constitution. It will be observed that this opinion does .not extend to thie case of a person who perorm no act in the prosecution of the war, who counsels and advises it, or who being engaged in the conspiracy fails to perform his part. Whether such persons may be implicated by the doctrine, that whatever. would make a man an accessary in felony'makes him a principal intreason, or are-excluded, because that doctrtne is inapplicable to the United States, the constitution having declared that treason shall consist only in levying war, and having made the proof of overt acts necessary to conviction, is a question of vast importance. which it would be proper for the supreme court to take a fit cccasion to de,

cide, but which an inferior tribunal would not willingly determine viless the case before them should require it.
It may now be propel' to notice the opinion of the supreme court in the case of the United States against Belman and Swartwout. It is said that this opinion in declaring that those who do not bejar arms may yet be guilty of treasbn, is contrary to law, and is not obligatory, because it is extra-judicial, and was delivered on a point not argued. This court is therefore reqiired to depart from the principle there laid down.
It is true, that in that case after forming the opinion that no treason could be committed, because no treasonable' assemblage had taken place, the court might hAve dispensed with proceeding further in the doctrines'of treason. But it is to be remembered, that the judges might act separately, and perhaps at the same time, on the various prosecutions which might be instItuted, and that no appeal lay from their decisions. Opposite judgments on the point would have presented a state of things infinitely to be deplored by all. It was not surprising, then, that they should have made some attempt to settle pi-inciples which would probably occur, and which were in some degree connected with the point before them.
The court had employed some reasoning to show that without the actual embodying.nf men,, war could not be levied. It might have been inferred from this, that th.se only who were so embodied could be guilty of treason. Not only to exclude this inference, but also to affirm the contrary, the court proceeded to observ, " It is not the intention of the court to say that no indiviclual ,car)be guilty of this crime who has not appeared in arms against his country. On the Contrary, if war be actually levied, that is; if a body of men be actually assembled for the purpose of effecting by force a treasonable object, all those who perform an) part, however minute, or however remote from the scene of action, and who are actually leagued in the general conspiracy, are to be considered as traitors."
This court is told that if this opinion be incorrect it ought not to be obeyed,- because it wqs extra-judicial. For myself, I can say that I could not lightly -be prevailed on to disobey it, were I even convinced thatit was erroneous, but I would certainly use any means which the law placed in my power to carry the question again before the supreme court, for re-. consideration, in a case -in which it wolild directly occur and be fully argued.
The court which gave this opinion was composed of four judges. At the time I thought them unanimous, but I have since'had reason to suspect that one of them, whose opinion is entitled to great respect, and whose indisposition prevented his entering into the discussions, on some of those points which were not essential to the decision of the very case under consideration, did hot concur in this particular point with his brethren. Had the opinion been unanimous, it would have been given by a majority of the judges. But should the three who were absent concur with that judge who was present, and who perhaps dissents from what was then the opinion of the court, a majority of the judges may overrule this decision. I should therefore feel no' objection, although I then thought, and still think the opinion perfectly cor-

rect, to carry the point if possible again, before the bupreme court, if the case should depend.upon iL
In saying that I siiU think the opinion perfectly correct, I do not consider myself as going further than the preceding reasoning goes. S .me gentlemen have argued as if the supreme court had adopted the whole doctrine of the English books on the subject of accessaries to treason. But certainly such is not the fact. Those only who pet-form a part, and who are leagued in the conspiracy are declared tobe traitors. To complete the definition both cirtcumstances must concur. They must 41perform a part," which. will lurnish the overt act, and they must be "leagued in the conspiracy." The person who comes within this description, iin the opinion of the court, levied war. The present motion, however, does not rest upon this point; for, if under this indictment the United States might be let in to prove the part performed by the prisoner, if he did perform any part, the court could not stop the testimony in its present stage.

2d. The second point involves the character of the overt act which has been given in evidence, and calls upon the court to declare whether tlat act can amount to levying war. Although the court ought now to avoid any analysis of the testimony which has been offered in this case, provided the decision ef the motion should not rest upon it, yet many reasons concur in giving peculiar propriety to a deliver", in the course of these trials, of a detailed opinion on the question, what is levying war ? As this question has been argued at great length it may probably save much trouble to the counsel now to give that opinion.
In opening the case it was contended by the attorney for the United States, and has since been maintained on the part of the prosecution, that neither arms nor the application of force or violence are indispensably necessary to constitute the fact of levying war. To illustrate thesepositions several cases have been stated, many of which would clearly amount to treason. In all of them, except that which was probably intended to be this cases and on which no observation will be made, the object of the assemblage was clearly treasonable : its character was unequivocal, and was demonstrated by evidence furnished by the assemblage itself : there was no necessity to rely upon information drawn from extrinsic sources, or in order to understand the fact, to pursue a course of intricate reasoning and to conjecture motives. A force is supposed to be collected for an avowed treasonable object, in a condition to attempt that object, and to have commenced the attempt by moving towurds it. I state these particulars because, although the cases put may establish the doctrine they are intended to support, may prove that the absence of arms, or the failure to apply force to sensible objects by the actual commission of violence on those objects, may be supplied by other circumstances, yet, they also serve to show that the mind requires those circumstances to be satisfied that war is levied.

Th eir construction of the opinion of the supreme court is, I thinks thus fdr correct. It is certainly the opinion which was at the time entertained by myself, and which is still entertained. If a rebel army, avowing its hostility to the sovereign power, should front that of the government, should march and countermarch before it, should mancenvre in its face, and should then disperse from any cause whatever without firing a gun, I confess I could not

06

APPENDIX.

-without sone Durprise, hear gentlemen. serioitsly contend that this could I. amqunt to an act'of levying war. A case equally strong may be put with respect to the absence of military weapons. If the paity be in a condition to -execute the phrposed treason without the usual irhplements of war, I can perceive no reason for requiring those implements in order to constitute the crime.
It is argued that no adjudged case can be produced from the English books where actual violence has not been committed. Suppose this were true, No adjudged case has, or it is believed, can be produced from those books In which it has been laid down, that war cannot be levied without tile actual ap.plication of violence to external objects. The silence of the reporters on this point may be readily accounted for. In cases of actual rebellion against the government, the most active and influential leaders are generally most Actively engaged in the war,.and as the object can never be to extend punishment to extermination, a sufficient number are found amon those who have committed actual hostilities, to satisfy the avenging arm of justice. In cases of constructive treason, such as pulling down meeting-houses, where the direct and avowed object is not the destruction of the sovereiln poweim' some act of violence might be generally required. to give the crime a suf. ficient degree of malignity to convert it into treason) to render the guilt of any individual unequivoral.
But Vaughan's case is a case where there -was po real application of violence, and where the act was adjudged to be treasoih. Gentlomen argue that Vaughan was only guilty of adhering to the king's enemies, but they have not the authority of the court for so saying. The judges unquestionably treat the cruisine'df Vaughan as an overt act of levying war.
The opinions of the best elementary writers concur 'in declaring, that where a body of men are assembled for the purpose of making war against the government, and are in a condition to make that war, the assemblage is an act of levying war. These opinions are contradicted by no'adjudged case, and are supported by Vaughan's case. This court is not inclined to contro. vert them.

But although in this respect, the opinion of the- supreme court has not been misunderstood on the part of the prosecution, that opinion seems not to have been fully adverted to in a very essential point in which it is said to have been misconceived by ethers.

The opinion J am informed, has been construed to mean that any asseme blage whatever for a treasonable purpose, whether in force, or not in force, whqther in a condition to use violence, or not in that condition, is a levying of war. It is this construction, which has not indeed been expressly advanced at the bar, but which is said to have bben adopted elsewhere, that the court deems it necessary to examine.
Independent of authority, trusting only to the dictates of reason, and expounding terms according'to their ordinary signification, we shnuld probably all concur in the declaration that war could not be levied without the eaployment and exhibition of force. War is an appeal from reason 'to the $word, and he who makes the appeal evidences the fact by the use of the

izeam. His intention to go to war may be proved by words, but the actual ging to war is a-factwhich ist.o be proved by open deed. The end is to be effected by force, and it would seem that in cases where no declaration is to be made, the state of actuatwar couldouly becreated by the employmeurof force, or being in a condition to employ it.
But the term having been adopted by our constitutlzn, must be understood in that sense-in which it was universally received in this tountry, when the constitution was framed. ThL sense in which it was received is to be collected from the most approved authorities of that riation from which we have borrowed the term.
Lord Coke says, that levying war against 'the king was treason at the common law. "A compassing or conspiracy to levy war," he adtL, "is no treatson, for there must be a Idvying of war in fact." He proceeds to state cases of constructive levying war, where the direct design is not to overturn the government but to effect some general oblject by force. The terms he employs in stating these cases,.are such as in'dicate an impression on his mind, thatactual violenee is a necessary ingredient in constituting the fact of levying war. He then proceeds to say, " an actual rebellion or insurrection is a levying of war within this act." "If any with strength and weapons invasive.and defensive doth hold aid defend a castle or fort against the king and his power, this is levying of war against the king." These cases are put to illustrate what he denominates "a war in fact." It is not easy to conceive "an actual invasion or insurrection" unconnected with force, nor can " a castle or fort be defended with strength and weapons invasive and defensive" without the employ,qent of actual fofce. It would seem then to have been the opinion of Lord Coke, that to levy war there must be an assemblage of uen in a condition and with'an intention to employ force. He certainly puts no case of a diflerent description.

Lord Hale says; (149. 6.) "what shall be said a levying of war is partly a question offact, for it is not every unlawful oe riotous assembly of many persons to do an unlawful act, though defacto they commit the act they intend, that makes a levyingof war; for then every riot would be treason," &c. "1but it must be -such an assembly as carries with it apjeciem belli the appearance bf war, as if they ride or march, -exillis exlicatis, with colours flying, or if theybe formed into companies, or furnished with militaiy officers, or ifthey rc armed with military weapons, as swords, guns, bills, halberds, pikes, and are so circumstanced that it may be reasonably concluded they are nt a poqturc of wart which circumstances arp so various that it is hard to describe them all particularly."
"Only the general expressions in all the indictments of this nature that I have seen are moreguerrinoarraiati,arrayed in a warlike manner."
He afterwards adds, "If there be a-war levied as is abovedeclared, viia.n assembly arrayedin warlike manner, and so in the posture ofwar for any treasonable attempt, it is be llum levatum, but not percusum.'I
It is obvious that Lord Hale supposed an assemblage of men in force, in. a .military posture to be necessary to constitute the fact of levying war. The idea he appears to suggest, that the apparattts of wa' is necessary, has been

APPE'ND IX.
very justly combated by an able judge who has writen a valuable treatise on the subjcct of treason ; but it is not recollected that his position, that theassembly should be in a posture of war for ary treasonable attempt, has ever been dtheenikedin.g aHndawtakk.echu.p IaTrm. ssecto. 2d3e.thsraoyns,e "hTimh,abt unt oatlsoonliyn tmhaonsey wothhoerrecbaseelsa,gtahionsset

Judge Foster, in his valuable treatise on treason, states the opinioh which has been quoted from Lord Hale, and differs from that writer so fur as the latter might seem to require swords, drums, coiours, &c. what lhe terms the pomp andspageantry of wark as essential circuistances to constitute tho fact of levying war. In the cases of pamaree and orchase, he says, "the want of those circumstances weighed notiivg with the court although the prisoner's ctunseinsisted much on thatmatter."

It is apparent that Judge Foster here alludes to an assemblaeoin force, or, s LordHale terms it, "ie a warlike posture ;" that ist in a condition to attdmpt er proceed upon the treason which had been contemplated. The same author afterwards states at large the cases of Danaree and Purchase, from 8th State Trials, and they are cases where the insurgents not ouly assembled in force in the poofture .. war, or in a condition to eectte the treasonable de-

Judge Foster states, sec. 4. alt insurrections to effect certain innovations of a public and general concern byt an.armedforce',to be, in construction of law, high treason within the clause of levying war.
The cases put by Foster of constructive levying of war, all contain as a xiaterial ingredient, the actual employment of force. After going through this branch of his subject, he proceeds to state the law in a case of actual levying 'war, that is, where the war is intended directly against the government.
He says, sec. 9. "An assembly armed and arrayed in a warlike manner for a treasonable purpose, is bellHum levatum, though not bellum percusum Listing and marching are sufficient overt acts without coming to a battle or action. So cruising on the king's subjects under a French commission, France being then at war' with us, was held to be adhering to the king's enemies, though no other act of hostility be proved."
"An assembly armed and arrayed in a warlike manner for any treasonable purpose" is certainly in a state of force; in a coiidition to execute the treason for which they assembled. The words "enlisting and marching," which are overt acts of levying war, do, in the arrangement of the sentence, also imply a state of force, though that state is not expressed in terms, for the succeeding words, which state aparticular event as not having happened, prove that.event to have been the next circumstanceto those which had huppenedthey are "1without coming to a battle or action." "If men be enlisted and march,3" (that is, if they march prepared for battle, or in a condition for action, for marching is a technical term applied to the movement of a military corps,) it is an overt Aht of levying war, though they do not come to a battle or action. This exposition is rendered the stronger by what seems to be put in the same sentence asa parallel ease with respect to adhering to an enemy. It is cruising under a commission from an enemy, without committing any other act of hostility. Cruising is the act of sailing in warlike form, and in a condition to assail those of whom the cruiser is'in quest.

This exposition, which seems to be that intended by Judge Foster, is rendered the more certain by a reference' to the case in the state Trials from which the extracts aretaken. The words used by the chief justice art, ,"when

mnen form themselves into a body and march rank and file with weapons offensive and defensive, this is levying of war with open force, if the design he public." Mr.Phipps, the counsel for the prisoner, afterwards observed, " In-

tending to levy war is not treason, .unless a war be actually'leviad" Tb, this

the chief justice answered, "Is it not actually levying of war, if they actually provide arms and levy men, and in a warlike manner set out and cruise, and come with a design to destroy'our ships.!" Mr. Phipps still insisted, "it

would not be an actual levying of war unless they committed sonle act of bos-

tility." "1Yes, indeed," said the chiefjustice; "the going on board and being in a posture to attack the king's ships." Mr.Baron Fowis'added, 1,butlor

you to say that because they did not actuallUy fight it is not -a levying of -'*ar, is it not plain what they did intend ? That they came with that intention,

that they came in that posture, that they came armed, 5nd had guns and

VoL IV

P

APPENDIX.
blunderbusses, and surrounded the ship twice; they came with an armed force, that is a strong evidence of the design."
The point insisted on by counsel in the case of Vaughan, as in this case, was, that war could not be levied without actual fighting. In this the counsel was very properly overruled , but it is apparent that the judges proceeded entirely on the idea that a warlike posture was indispensable to the fact of levying war.
Judge Foster proceeds to give other instances of levying war. "Attackint the king's forces in opposition to his authority upon a march or in quarters Is levying war." "Holding a castle or fort against the king or his forces, If act-ualforce be used in orderto keeiz fiossession, is levying war. But abare detaier, as suppose by shutting the gates against the king or his forces, without any other foice from within, Lord Hale conceiveth will not amount to treason."
The whole doctrine of Judge Foster on this subject, seems to demonstrate a clear opinion that a state ef force and violence., a posture of war, mlist exist to constitute technically as well as really the fact of levying war.
Judge Blackstone seems to,concur with his predecessors. S pekmg of levying war, he says, "This may be done by taking arms uiot only to dethrone the kig, but under pretence to reform religion, or the laws, br to remove evil counsellors, or other grievances, whether real or pretended. For the lw does nut, neither oan it, permit any private man or set of men to interfereforcibly in matters-of such'igh importance."
He proceeds to give examples of levying war, which show ,that he contemplated actual force as a necessary ingredient in the composition of this crime.
,It would seem then from the English authorities, that the words "levying war," have not received a technical, different from their natural, mecaning, so far as respects the character of the assemblage of men which may constitute the fact. It must be a warlike assemblage., carrying the appearance of force, and in a situation to practise hostility.
Several judges of the United States have given opinions at their. circuits bn this subject, .aU of which deserve and will receive the particular.attention of this court.
In his charge to the grand jury, wvhen John Fries was indict6d, in consequence of a forcibi'opposition to the direct tax, Judge Iredell is understood to have said, "1Iihink "Iam warranted in saying, that if in the case of the'insurgents who may come under your consideration, the intention wa's to prevent by force of arms the execution of any act of the congress of the United States altogether, any forcible of1osition calculated to carry that intention into effect, was a evying of wat' against the United States and. of course an act of treason." To levy war then, according to this opinion of Judge Iredell, required the actual exertion of force.

APPENDIX.
. judge Paterson, in his opinions delivered in two different cases, seems hot to differ from Judge IredelL 'He does not, indeed, precisely statetheemployment of force as necessary to constitute a levying of war, but in giving his opinion in cases in which Iforce was actually employed, he considers the crime in one case as dependent on the intention, and in the other case he says, ,1combining th se factswith this design," (thadtis, combiningactualforcewith a treasonable design,) "1the crime is high treason."
.Judge Peters has also indicated the opinion that force was necessary to constitute the crime of levying war.
Judgo-Chase has been particularly clear and explicit. In an opinion inich he appears to have prepared on great consideration, he says, 9"The court are of opinion, that if a body of people conspire and meditate an insurrection to resist or oppose the execution of a statute of the United States by force, that they are only guilty- of a high misdemeanor : but if they proceed to parry such inteiitign into execution by force, that they are guilty of the treason of levying war; and the quantum of the force employed neither increases nor diminishes the crime; whether by one hundred-or one thousand persons, is wholly immnaterihL
"The court are of opinion, that a combination or conspiracy to levy war against theUnitd States, is not treason unless combined with an attempt to carry such combination or conspiracy into execution, some actualforcor violence mu~t be usedin pursuance of such design to levy wiar: but that it is altogether immaterial whether the force use4 be sufficient to effectuate the object. Any force connected with theintefition will constitute the crime of levying of war."
In various parts of the opinion delivered by Judge Chase, in the case of Fries, the same sentiments are to be found'. It is to be observed, that these judges arenot content that troops should be assembled, in a condition tolemploy force I according t6 them, some degree of force miust hav6 been actually employed.
The juxdges of the United States, then, so far ag their opinions have been qutoted, seerp to'have required still foreto constitute the fact of levyingwar, than has been requiredby theEnglishbooks. Oifr judges seem to have required the actual exercise of force, the-actual employment of some degree of violence. This, however, may be, aM pi.obably is, because in the cases in which their opinions were given, the design nothaving been to overturn the goverbmefit; but to resist the execution of a law, such an assemblage would be sufficient for the purpose, as to require the actual employment of force -to render the object unequivocal.
But it is said all these authorities have been overruled by.the decision of the .upreme court in the case of the United States against Swartwout and Bollman.
If.the suprdme court have indeed extended the doctrinetf treasbn, further fian it has heretofore been carried by the judges of England, or of this courttry, their decision would be submitted to. At least this court could go no further than to endeavour again to bring the point directly before them. It wculd

482

howeyer be expected that an o0hiiion which is td overruld all former prece-
dents, and to establish a principle never before r~cognized, should be expressed in plain ana explicit terms. A mere implication ought not to prostrate a principle which seems to have beei so well established Had the intention
been entertained to make so material a change it this iespect, the court ought to have expressly declared, that any assemblage of men Whatever, who hat fbrmed a treasonable design, whether in force.or not, whether in a condition to atteinpt the design or not, whether attended with warlike appearances or not,
constitutes the fact of levying war. Yet no declaration to this amount is made.
Not an expregsion of the kind is to be found in the opinion of the supreme court.
The foundation ofi which this argument rests is the omission of the 'court to state, that the assemblage which constitutes the fact of levying war ought tobn in force; and soinerpassages which show that the question respecting the natiro
of the assemblage was not in the mind of the court when the opinion was drawn,
which passagei are mingled with others, which at least show that thbre was no intention to depart from the course of the prededents in cases of treason by levying war.

Every opinion, to be correctly understood, ought to be considered with C view to the case in which it was delivered. In the case of the United States against BQllman and Swartwout, there was no 'evidence that even two men
hwaedre ecvhearr.gmeedt fwoirththheavpiunrgpopsaertoifciepxaetecdu.tingIt thweapslatnh,erienfo'wrehiscihffitchioesnet pfoerrsothnos
boqrt to say: that' unless men werp assembled, war could dlot be levied. That case was decided by this declaration. The court might indeed have defined the species of assemblage which'would amount to levying "ofwar ;' but, as this opinion was not a treatise on treason, but a dLcilsion of a particular case) expressions of doubtful import shoild be construed in reference to the case itself; and the mere!omission to state that a particular circumstance was necessary to the consumnhation of the crine$ ought not to beconstrued into a declaration that the circumstance was unimportant. General expressions ought not to be considered as overruling settled principles without a direct declaration to that effect. After these preliminary observations the court will proceed to examine the opinion which has occasioned them.

The first expression in it bearing oil the present question is, " To constitute that specifi crime for which theTrisoner now before the court has been committed, war must be actually levied against the United States. However flagitous may: be the crime of conspiracy to subvert by force the government of our country, such conspiracy is not treason. To'-conspire to levy war
and actually to levy war, are distinct offences. - The first must be brought into operation by the assemblage of men for a purpose treasonable in Itself, or the fact of levying war cannot have been committed."

Although it is not expressly stated that the assemblage of men for the purpose of carrying into operation the treasonable intent, which will amount to
levying war, mus! be an assemblage in force, yet it is fairly *to bp inferred froM the context, and nothing like dispensing with force appears in this paragraph. The expressions Ere, "to constitute the crime war nust be actually levied.Vl A conspiracy to leyy war is spoken of as " a cbnspiracy to subver
by force the government of our country." Speaking in' general terms.of an assemblage of men for this, or for any other purpose, a person.would naturally be understood as speaking of an assemblage in some degree adapted to the

APPENDIX.

4$3

purpose. An assemblage to subvert by force the government of our country, and amounting to a levying of war, should be an assemblage in force.
In a subsequent paragraph the court says, ,IIt is not the intention of the court to say, that no individual can be guilty of this .crime who has not appeared in arms against his country. On the contrary if war be actually levied, that is,. if a body of men'be actually assembled in order to effect by force a treasonable purpose, all those who perform any part, however minute, &c. and who are actually leagued in the general conspirqcy, are traitors. But there must be an actual assembling of men for the treasonable purpose, to constitute a levying of war.'
The observations made on the preceding paragraph apply to this. 6cA body of men actually assembled, in order to effect by force a treasonable purpose," must be a body assembled with such appearance of force as would warrant the opinion that they were assembled for the particular purpose; an assemblage to constitute an actual levying of war should be an assemblag with such appearance of force, as would justify the opinion that they met or the purpose.
This explanation, which is believed to be the natural, certainly not a strained explanation of the words, derives some additional aid from the terms in which the paragraph last quoted comnmences. 4 It is not the intention of the court to say that no individual can be guilty of treason who has not appeared in arms against his.country," These words seem to obviate an inference which might otherwise hrve been draivn from the preceding paragraph. They indicate, that in the mind of the court the assemblage stated in that paragraph was an assemblage in arms. That the individuals who composed it, had appeared in arms against their country. Thnt is izl other words, that the assemblage was a military, a warlike assemblage.

The succeeding paragraph in the opinion relates to a conspiracy, and
serves to show that force'and violence were in the mind of the court, qnd that there was no idea of extending the crime of treason by construction beyond the constitutional definition which had been given of it.

Returning to the case actually before the court, it is said, "1a design to overturn-the government of the United States in New-Orleans by force
-would have been unquestionably a design which if carried into execution -would have been treason, and the assemblage of a body of men for the purpose .of carrying it into execution would amount to levying of war against thq United States'!

Now what could reasonably be said to be an assemblage of a body of men for the purpose of overturning the government of the United States in NewOrleans by force? Certainly an assemblage in force ; an assemblage prepared and intending to act with force; a military assemblage.

Thedecsions theretofore made by the judges of the United States, are then declared to be in conformity with the principles laid down by the supreme court.' Is this declaration compatible with the idea of departing from those opinions on a point within the contemplation of the court . The

4B4

APPENDIX.

opinions of Judge .Paterson and Judge Iredell are said " to imply an actual assembling of men, though they rather designed to remark on the purpose to -which the force was to be applied than on the nature of the force itself." This observatiop 'ertainly indicates that the necessity of an assemblage of men was the partieular point the court meant to estiblish, and that the idea of force was never'separated from this assemblage.
The opinion of Judge Chase is next quoted with approoation. This opinion in terms requires the employment of force.
After stating the verbal communications said to have been xnade by Mr. Swartwout to general Wilkinson, the. court says, " if these words import that the government of New-Orleans was to be revolutionized by force; although merely as a step to or a mean of executing some greater projects, tile design wgs unquestionably treasonble, and any assemblage of men fo that purpose would amount to a ldvying of war." "
The words " any assemblage of meb," if construed to affirm that any two or thre'e of the conspirators who might be found together after this plan had been formed, wbuld be the act of levying war, would certainly be misconstrued. The sense of the expressions " any assemblage of men," Is restricted by the worcTs "for this purpose." Now could it be in the contempln. tioq of the court that h body of men would assemble for the purpose of revolutionizing New-Orleans ly force, who should not themselves be in force?
After noticing some difterence of opinion among the judges respeoting the' import of the ,words said to have been used by Mr. Swartwout, tilceourt proceeds tp observe': " But whether this treasonable intention be really Im. putable to the plan or.not, it Is admitted that it must have been carried into execution by an open assemblage for that purpose,. previous to the arrest of the prisoner, in order to consummate the crime as tohim"
Could tht,court have conceived 11an open assemblage" "4for the purpose of overturning the governmjent of New-Orleans by force" "4to be only equiva,lent to a secret furtive asseiblage without the appearance of force."
After quoting the words of Mr. Swarlwout, from the affidavit, in whlelclt was stated thdt Mr. Burr was levying an army of 7;000 men, and observing that the treason to be inferred from these words'would depend on the inten. tion with which it was levied; and on the progress ivhich had been made i,4 levying it, the court iay, (9the question then is, whether this ei'iderice prover enlotnel Burr to have advanced so far inlevying an army k~asctually to have assdmbied them"
Actually to assenbl an army of 7,000 men is unquestionably to place, those who are so asserhbled'in a state of -open force..

APPENDIX.
tachments to the place -of rendezvous must be sufficient to constitute the crime"
" This position is correct with some qualification. It cannot be necessary that the whole army should assemble and that the various parts which are to compose it should have combined. But it is necessary there should be an actual assemblage ; and therefore this evidence should make the fActunequivocal.
" The travelling of individuals to -the place, of rendezvous, would perhaps not be sufficient. This would be an equivocal act, and has no warlike appearance. The meeting of particular bodies of mcn, and their marching from places of partial to a place of general rendezvous, would be such an assemblage."
The position here stated by-the counsel for the prosecution is, that the army " commencing its march by detachments to,the place of rendezvous (that is of the army) must'be sufficient to constitute the crime."
This position is not admitted "by the coort, to be universally correct. It is said to be "correct with some qualification:' What is that qualification ?
V The travelling of individuals to the place of rendezvou,%" (and by this. term is not to be understood.one individual by himself, but peveral individuals either separately or together but not in military form) "would porhaps not be sufficient.' Why not Sufficient ? " Because," says the court, "this would be an equivocal act and has no warlike appearance." The act, then,,shotrld be unequivocal and should have a warlike ajipearance. It must exhibit, in the words of Sirt Matthew Hale, afseciem bell the appearance of war.
This construction is rendered in some measurq necessary when we observe that the court is quilifying the position, "That the army commencing their march bydetachments to the place of relidezvous mu'st be sdfficient to cnmstitute the crime." In qualifying this -position they say, "the travelling 6f individuals would perhaps not be sufficient." Now, a solitary individual traveling to any point, with any intent, could not without a total disregard of language, be termed a marching detachment. The court, therefore, m.tt have contemplated several individuals travelling together ; and the words -being used in reference to the position ihey were intended to qualify, would · seem to indicate the distinction between the appearances attending ilse usu:d movem'ent of a company of men for civil purposes, and that military movement which might in correct language be denominated " marching by dletachments."
-The dpurt then proceeded to say, " the meeting of.particular bodies of sten, and their marching from places of partial to a place of general rendezvous, would be such an assemblage.'
It is obvious from the context, that the court must htve intended to state a case which would in itself be unequivocal, because it would have a warlike appearance. The case stated is that of distinct bodies of min- assembling at different places ani marching from these places of partialto a

place of general rendezvous. When this has been done; an assemblage is produced which would in itself be unequivocal. But when is it done ? what is the assemblage here described ? The assemblage formed of thd different bodie of' partial at a general place of rendezvous. In doscribing the mode of coming to this assemblage the civil tetria 4 travelling" is dropped, and the military term " marching ' is employed. If this was intended as a definition of an assemblage which would amount to levying w r, the definition requires an assemblage at a general place of rendezvous composed of bodies of men who had previously assembled at places of partial rendezvous. But this is not intended as a defition, for clearly if there sliould be no places of partial rendezvous, if troops should embody In the first instance, in great force for the purpose of subverting the government by violelt.e, the act would be unequivocal, it would have a warlike appearance, and
it would, according to the opinion of the supreme court properly construed, and according to the English authorities, amount to levying war. But this, though not a definition, is put as an example ; and surely it may be safely taken as an example. If diffirent bodies of men, in pursuance of a treasonable dehiir-plainly proved, should assemble in warlike appearance at places of partial rendezvous, and should warch from those places to a place of general rendezvous, it is difficult to conceive how such a transaction could take place without exhibiting tile appearance of war, without an obvious display of force. At any rate, a court in stating generally such a military assemblage as would amount to levying war, and having a case before them in which there was no assemblage whatever, cannot reasonably be understood In putting such an example, to dispense with those appearances of war which seem to be required by the general current of authorities. Certainly they ought not to be so understood when they say in express terms, that Itit Is 'more safe as "wellas more consonant to the principles of our conistitution, that "he crime of treason should not be extended by construction to doubtful cases ; and that crimes not already within the constitutional definition, should receive such punishment as the legislature in its ivisdom.may provide."
After this analysis of the opinion of the.supreme court, it will be observ~d, that the direct question whether an assemblage of men which might be construed to amount to a levying of war, must appear in force or in military form, 'was not in argument or in fact before the court, and 'does not appear tohave
been in terms decided ?' The opinion seems to Have been drawtil without particularly adverting to this question, and therefore upon a transient view of particular expressions, might inspire the idea that, a displav of force, that appearances aof war were not necessary ingredients to constfiute the fact of levying war. But upon a more intent and more accurate investigation of this -opinionalthougb the terms fIrrce and violence are'not employed as descriptire of the assemblage, such requisites are declared to be indispensable as cal scarcely exist without the appearance of war and the existence of real force. It is said that war must be levied in fact ; that the object must be 4nq which is to be effected by force ; that the assemblage must be such as to prove that this is its object ; that it must not be an equivocal act, without a warlike ap.
pearance.; that it must be an open assemblage for the'purpose otf force. in
the course of thig opinion, decisions' are quoted and approved, which require the employment of forde to constitute the crime, It seems extremely dimcult, if not impossible, to reconcile these various declarations with the idea thai the supreme'court considered a secret unarmed'mecting. althofugh that

APPENDIX.

49V

meeting be of conspirators, and although it met with a treasonable intent, as an actual levying of war. Without saving that the assemblage must be in form, they express themselves so as to show that this idea was force never or discaided, in warlike and they use terms which cannot be otherwisqsatisfied.

The opinion of a single judge certainly weighs as nothing if opposed to that of the supreme court; but if he was one of the judges who" asisted in framing that opinion, if while the impression under which it was framed was his mind, he delivered an opinion on the same testimony, not contradictory yet to fresh that upon which bad been given by all the judges together, but showing the sense in which he understood terms that might be differently expounded, it may fairly be said to be in some measure explanatory of the opinion itself.

To the judge before whom the charge against the prisoner at the bar was the same testimony was offered with that which had been exhibited before first the brought, supreme'court, and he was required to give an op:alon in almost the same case. Upon this occasion he said, 11War can only be levied by the employment of actual force. Trdcips must be embodied; men must be assembled id order to levy war." Again he observed, "The fact to be
this case is afn act of public notoriety. It must exist in the view of the proved world, in or it cannot exist1 at all. The assembling of forces to levy war is a visible tr-nsacton,.,and numbers must witness it."

It is not easy to doubt what kind of assemblage was in the min&of the judge who used these expressions, and it is to be recollected that le bad just returned from the supreme court, and was speaking on the very facts oRnwhich the opinion of that sourt was delivered.

The same judge in his charge to the grand jury who found this bill, observed, "To constitute the fiact of levying war, it is not necessary tb'iit hostilities shall have actually commenced by engaging the military force of the United States, or that measures of violence against the government shall have been carried into-execution. But levying war is a fact in the constitution of which force is an indispensable' ingredient. Any combination to subyert by force the government of the United States, violently to dismember the union, to compel a change in the alministration, to coerce the repeal or adoption of a general law, is a' conspiracy to levy war, and if the conspiracy be carried into effect by the actual employment of force, by the embodyioi and assembling of men for the purpose of executing the treasonable design which
conceived, it amounts to levying of war. It has been held that arms are was not previously essential to levying war provided the force assembled b; sufficient to attain, or perhaps to justify attempting the object without them.' This paragraph is immediately followed by a reference to the opinion of the supreme court.

It requires no commentary upon these words, to show, that in the Dpnion of the judge who uttered them, an assemblage of men which should conslitute the fict of levying war must be an assemblage in torce, and that he so u'derstood the opinion of the supreme court. If in that opinion, there may be found in some passages, a want of precision: and indefiniten~ssof expres-

sion, which nas occasioned it to be differently understood by differ'ent persons, that m'ay well -be accounted for when it is recollected thatin the particular case there was no assemblage whatever. In expounding that opinion the Whole should be taken together, and in reference to the particular case in which it was delivered. It is, however, not improbable that the misunderstifnding has arisen from this circumstance. The court unquestionably did not consider 'arms as an indispensable requisite to levying war ; an assemblage adapted to the object might be in a condition to effect or to attempt it without them. ' Nor did the court consider the actual application of the force to'the object, at'all times, an' indispensable requisite ; for an assemblage might be in a condition to apply force, might be in a state adapted to real war, without having made the actual application of that force. From theo positions, which are to be found in the opinion, it may have been inferred, it is thought too hastily, that the nature-of the asseinblage was unimportant,' 9nd that war might be considered as actually levied by any meetin; of men, if a criminal intention can be imputed to them by testimony of any kind whgtever.
It has been thought proper to discuss this question at large.a-nd to review the opinion of thesupreme court, although this court would be more disposed to leave the question of fact, whether an overt act of levying war was committed on .Blennerhassett's island to the jury under this explanation of tile law, and to instruct them, that unless the issemblage on Blenncrhassett'a island was an assemblage in force.; was a military assemblage in a colndition to make war, it was not a levying of war, and that they could not construe it into an act of war, than to arrist the further testimony which might be offered to connect the prisoner with that assemblage, or to prove the intention of those who assembled together at that place. This point, however, is not to be understood as decided. It will) perhaps, constitute an essential inquiry in anothei case.'
Before leaving the opinion of the supreme court ntirely on the question of the nature of the assemblage which will constitute an act of levying var, this c9 urt cannot forbear to ask, why is an assemblage absolutely re. quired ? Is it not to judge in some measure of the end by 4he prportion which the means'bear to the end ? Why is it that a single armed Indivldual, entering a boat and sailing down the Ohio, for the avowed purpose of attacking New-Orleans, could not be said to levy war ? Is it not that he 'd ap'ptreiatly not in a condition to levy war? If this b6 so, ought not the assemblage to furnish some evidence. of its intention and capacity to levy war before it can amount to levying war ? And 'ought not the supreme court, when speaking of an assemblage for the purpose of effecting a treasonable object by force, be understood to indicate an assemblage exhibiting the appearance of force.
The definition of the attorney for the United States, deserves notico in tfls respect. It is "when there is an assemblage of meu, convened forthepurpbse of cffecting by force a treasonable object, which force is meant to be employed before the assemblage disperses, thisis treason."
To read this definition without adverting to.-the argument, we should infer thittthe assemblage was itself to effect by force the treasonable object, not to join itself to some other bodies of men and then to effect the object by their combined force. Under this construction it would b6 experted the ap-

APPENDIX.
pearanqe of the assemblage would hear some proportion to tae object, and 'zrould indicate the intention, At any rate that it would be an asemblage in force. This construction is most certiinly not that which was intended, but it serves tQ show that general phrases must always be understood in reference to the subject matter, and to the general principles of law.
On that division of the subject which respecta the merits of the case connected with the pleadings, two points are also made.
1st. That this indictment having charged the prisoner with levyitg war on Blennerhassett's island and containing no other overt act, canno; be supported by proof that war was levied at that place by other persons in the absence of the prisoner, even admitting those perspns to be connected with him in one common treasonable conspiracy.
2dy. That admitting such an indictment could be supportpd by such evidance, the previous conviction of some person who committed the act which is said to amount to levying war, is indipensable to the conviction of a person who advised or procured that act.
As to the first point, the indictment contains two counts, one ut which charges that the prisoner with a number of persons unkhown, levied war on Blennerhassett's island, in the county of Wood, in the district of Virginia; and the other adds the circumstance of their proceeding from that island down the river, for the purpose of seizing New-Orleans by force..
In point of fact, the prisoner was not on Blennerhassett's island, npr in the county of Wood, por in the district of Virginia.
In-considering this point the court is led first to inquire whether an indictment for levying war mqst specify an overt act, or would be *sufficient if it merely charged the prisoner in general terms with having levied witr, omitting the expression of ulace or circumstance.
Whe place in which a crime was committed is essential to an indictmert, were it only to shew the jurisdiction of the court. It is also essential for the purpose of enabling the prisoner to nake his defence. That, at common law, an jndictment would have been defective which did not mention the plnce in which the crime w;xs committed, can scarcely be doubted. FQr this, it is sufficient to refer to Hawkins, . 2. c. 25. sect. 84. and c. 23, sect. 91. This necessity is rendered the stronger by the constitutional provision that the .offendhr, "shall be tried in the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed," add by the -act of congress which requires that twelve petty jurors at least shall be summoned from the county where the offence was committed.
A description of the particular manner in which. the war was levied, seems also essential to enable the accused to make his defence. The law does not expect a maln to be prepared to defend every act of his life which may be suddenly and withoutnotice alleged against him. In common justice the particular fact with which he is charged ought to he stated, and stated in such a manner as to afford a reasonable certainty of the nature of the accusation, and the circumstances which will be adduced against him. The general doctrine on the subject-of indictments is full to this point. Foster, p. 149. speak-

APPENDIX.
in& of the treason of compassing the king's death, says, "9Fi'om what hag been said it followeth that in. every indictment for this species of treason, and indeed for levying war anda'dhering to the king's enenies, an overt act must be alleged and proved. For the overt act is the charge to which the prisoner must apply his defence."
In p. 220. Foster'repeats this declaration. It is also laid down in Hawk. B. 8. c. 17. sect. 29. 1 Hale, 121. 1East, 116. and by the other authorities cited, especially Vaughan's case. Ip corroboration of this opinion, it may be observed, that treason can only be established by the proof of overt acts, and that by the common law as well as by the statute of 7 of William Ill. those overt acts, only which are charged in the indictment can be given in evidence, unless, perhaps, as corroborative -testimony after .he overt acts are proved. That clause it) the constitution, too, whlich says that in all'crimainl'prosecutions the accuscd shall enjoy the right " to be informed of the natu'o and cause of the accusation," is considered as having a direct bearig on this point. It secures to him such information as will enable him to prepare for his defence.
It seems then to be perfectly clear, that it would nqt be sufficient for an indictment to allege generally that the accused had levied war against tire United States. The charge must be more particularly specifie'd by laying -what is te rmed an overt act of levying war. The law relative to an appeal, as cited from Stamford,' is strongty corroborative of this opinion.
If it-be necessary to specify the charge in the indictment, it would seem to rollow irresistibly, that the charge must be proved as laid.
All the authorities which require an overt act, require also that this overt act should be proved. The decision in Vaughajn's casd is particularly in point. Might it be otherwise, the, charge of an overt act would be a mischief instead of an advantage to the accused. It would' lead him frorn the true cause and nature of the accusation, instead of informing him respecting it.
But it is contended on the part of the prosecution thfit, although the accused had neier been with the party which assembled at Blenncrhassett's island, and was, at the time, at a great distance, and in a different state, he was yet legally present, and therefore may properly be charged in tire Indictment as being present in fact.
It is therefore necessary to inquire whether in this case the doctrine of constructive presence can apply.
It is conceived by the court to be possible that a person may be concerned in a treasonable conspiracy, andf'yt be legally, as well as actually, absent, while some one act of the treason is perpetrated. If a rebellion should be so extensive as to spread through every state in the union, it will scarcely be contended that everyindividual concerned in it is legally present at ever) ov.ert act committqd in the course of'tjiat rebellion. It would be a very violent pre. sumption indeed, too violent to be'inade without clear authority, to presume that even the chief of the rebel army was legally present at every such overt act. If the main rebel army with the chief at its fiead, should be prosequ-

APPENDIX.

491

Ling war at ne extremity df our tirritory, say in New Hampshire, if this chief should be there captured and sent to the other extremity for the purpose of trial, if his indictment, instead of alleging an overt act which was true in point of fact, should allege that he had assembled some small party, which in truth he had not seen, and had levied war by engaging in a skirmish' in Georgia at a time when in reality lie was fighting a battle in N'ew Hampshire, if such evidence would support such an indictment by the fiction that he was legally present though really absent, all would ask to.what purpose are those provisions in the constitution which direct the place of trial, and ordain that the accused shall be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation r
But that a man may be legally absent who has counselled or ,procured a treasonable act, is proved by all those books which treat upon the subject, and which concur in declaring that such a person is a principal traitor, not because he was legally present, but because in treason all are principals. Yet the indictment, upon general principles, would charge him according to the truth of the case. Lord Coke says, "if many conpire to levy war, and some of them do levy the same according to the conspiracy, this is high treason in all." Why? Because all were.legally present when the war was levied? No. "For-in treason," continues Lord Coke, 11all be principals, and war is lqviedY In this case the indictment, reasoning from analogy, would not chargethat the absent conspirators were present, but would state the truth of the case. If the conspirator had done nothing which amounted to levying of war, and if by our constitution the doctrine that-an accessary becomes a principal. Le not adopted, in consequence of which the conspirator could not be contlermncd under an indictment stating the truth of the case, it would be going very far to say that this defect, if it be termed ones may be cured by an hidictilent stating the case untruly.

This doctrine of Lord Coke has been adopted by all subsequent w. sters; and it is generally liid down in the Englith banks that whatever will make a rnanan accessary in felony, will make him a principal in treasmi ; but it is no where suggested that he is by construction to be cwnsld'retr . present when in point of fact he was absent.
Foster har, been particularly quoted, and certainly lie is precisely in point. "It is well known," says Foster, i that in the language of the case, there are no accessaries in high treason; all are principis. Every instance of incitement, aid, or protection, which in the case of felony will render a man an accessary before or after the fact, in the case of high treason, whether it be treason atcommon law or by statute, will make him a priucipal in treason." The cases of incitement and aid are cases put as examples of a man's becoming a principal in treason, not because he was legally present, but by force of tharmaximin the common law, that whatever will render a ral an accessary at common law will render him a principal in tyreason. In other passages the words "command" or " procure" are used to indictate the samestate of things, thatis, a treasonable assemblage produced by a man who-is hot himself in that assemblage.
In point of law.then, the man who incites, aids, or procures a tre~nnble act, is not, merely in conseqfnence of that incitement, aid or procurement, legally present when that act is committed.

492

APPENDIX.

It it does not resultfrom the nature of the crime that all who are concerned init are legally present at every overt act, then each case depeilds upon its own circumstances, and to judge how far the circumstances of tiny case call make him legally present who is in fact absent, the doctrine of constructive presence mst be exaplined.
Hale, in his 1 vol. p. 615. says, " reguJarly no man can be a principal In felony unless-he .be present." In the same page he says, ccan accessary before is he that being absent at the time of the felony committed, dothyet procure, cuunsel, or command another to commit a felony." .The bobks are.full
of passages which state this to be the law. - Foster, in showing yhat acts oE
concurrence will make a man a principal, says, "he must be present at the perpe'tration, otherwise he can be no more than an accessary before tho fact.

·These strong distinctions would be idle, at afiy rate theywould be inapplicable to treason, if they were to be entirely lost iu the doctrine of constructive *presence..
Foster adds, p. 349. "when the law requireth the presence of the accomplice at the perpetratiop of the fact in order to render hima principal, it doth. no, require Astrict actual immediate presence, such a presence nawould make him an *eye or ear witness of what passeth." The terms used by Foster are such as would be employed by a man intending.to show the necessity that tie absent pelson should be near at hand, although from the nature of the thing no precise distance could be marked out. An inspection of the cases from which Foster drew this general principle will serve to illustrate iL (See Hale, 439.) In all these cases, put by Hale, the whole patty set out together to commit the very fact charged in the indictment, or to commit some other unlawful act, in which they are all to be personally concerned at the same time and place, and are, at the very time when the criminal fact is .committe , near enough to give.actual personal aid and asistance to the man who perpetrated it. Hale, in p. 449. giving the reason for the decision in the case of the Lord Dacres, says, ," they all Game with an intent to steal the deor, and consequently the law supposes that they came all with the intent to oppose all that should hinder them inthat design." . The original case says this was their resolution. This opposition would beua personal-opposition. This case, even as stated by Hale, would clearly not comprehend an mail who entered into the combination, but whoa instead of going to the park where the murder was committed, should not set out with the others, should go to a differeht park, or~should even lose his way. See Hale, 534.
In both the.cases here stated, the persons actually set out together, and were near enough to assist itj the commission of the fact. That in the case of Pudsy the felony was, as stated by Hale, a different felony from that originally intended, is unimportant in regard to the particular principle now under considerittion, o far as respected distance, as respectcd capacity to hssist in case of resistance, it is the same as if the robbery had been that which'was originally designed. The case in the original report shows that the felony cbmmtted was in fact in pursuance of that originally designed. Foster, q50. plainly supposes the same particular design, not a general design composed of many particular distinct facts. .'He supposes them to be.lco-operatilg with' respect to that particular design This niny be illustrated by a case which Is perhap4

times, by different ro'ads, to attack and r6b different individuals or different companie4 ; to commit distinct acts of robbery. It has never been contended that those who committed one act of robbery, or who failed altogether, were constructively present-at the act of those.who were assooiated with them in *thecommon object of robbery,.who -were to share the plunder, but who did not assist at the particular fact. They do indeed belong to the general party, but they are uot of the particular party which committed this fact. Foste- cu. eludes this subject by observing, that "1in order to render a person an'accomplice and a principal in felony, he must be aiding and abetting at the fact, or ready toafford assistance if necessary." That is, attheprticular fact which islcharged, he must be ready to render assistance to those who are committing that particular fact; he must, as is stated by ,Hawkins, be ready to give immediate and direct assistance.

All the cases to be found in',the books go to the same point. Let them be applied to that under consideration.

The whole treason laid in this indictment is the levying of war~in Blepnerhassett'sisland, and the whole question'to which the 'inquiry of The court Is now directed is, whether the lrisoner was'legally present at that fact.
I say this is the whole-question, because thi prisoner can only be convicted on the overt act laid in the indictment. With respect to this prosecution, it is as if no other overt act existed. If other overt'acts'can be inquired into, it is for the sole purpose of proving the particalair fact charged ; it is as evidence of. the crime consisting of this particular fact, not as establishing the general crime by a distinct fact.

The counsel for the pros6cution havechhrged those engaged in the detence with considering the overt act as~the treason, whereas it ought to.be consider.
ed solely as the evidence of the treason; but the counsel for -the prosecution seein themselves not to have sufficiqntly adverted to this clear principle that though the overt act mnay notbe itself the treason, it is the sole act of that treason which can produce conviction. It -is the sole point in issue between the parties. And theonly division of that point, if the expression be allowed, which the court is now examining, is the constructive presence of the prisoner at the fact charwed.

To return then to the application of the cases
Had the prisoner set out with the party frbm Beaver for Blennerbasselt's
island, or, perhaps, had be set out for that place, though not from Beaver, and
had arrived in the island, he would have been present at the fact; had he not arrived in the island, but had taken a position near enough to co-operate with these on the island, to assist them in any act of hostility, or to aid'them if attack.edo, the question whethei he 'vasconstruetively present would be a que,-

APPENDIX.
"tion compotinded of law and fact, which would be decided bythejury, V1i1th the aid of the court, so far as respected the law. In this case the accused would have been of the particular party assembled on the island, and would have been associated with them in the particular act of levying war said to have been committed on the island.
But if he was not with the party at any time before they reached the Island; if he did not join them there, or intend to join them there ; if his,personal co. operation in tlie general planwas to be afforded elsewhere, at a greatdistance, in a different state ; if the overt acts of treason to be pef'lormed by him wore to be distinct overt acts ; then he was not of the particular party assembled at Blenaerhassett's island, and was not coustructively present, aiding arid assisting in the particular act which was there committed.
The testimony on this point, so far as it has been delivered, is not equivocal. There is not only io evidence that the accused was of the particular party which assembled on Blenuerhassett's island, but the whole evidence shows he was notif-thhat party.
In felony then, admitting the crime to have been completed on the island, and to have been advised, procured, or commanded by the accused, he would have been incontestibly an accessary, and not a principal
But in treason, it is said, the law is oth..rwise, because the theatre of action is more extensive.
This reasoning applies in England as-strongly as in the United States. While in '15 and '45 the fa-mily of Stuart sought to regain the crown they had forfeited, the struggle was for the whole kingdom ; yet no man was ever considered as legally present at one place, when actually at another; or as aiding In one transation, while actually cmployed in another.
With the perfect knowledge that the whole nation may be the thentre of action, the English books unite in declaring, that he who counsels, procuresm, or aids treason, is guilty accessorially, and solely in virtue of the common law principle, that what will make a man an accessary in felony makcs him a principal in treason. So far from considering a man as constructively present at every overt act of the general treason in which lie may hirvc been concerned, the whole doctrine of the books limits the proof against him to those particular overt acts of levying war- wth which he is charged.
What would be the effect of a different doctrine ? Clearly that which has
been stated. ff a person levying war in Kentucky may be said to be construc-
tively present and assembled with a party carrying on war in Virginia, at a great distance from him, then he is present at evcry overt act performedany where: he may be tried in any state on the continent, where any overt act has been committed; he may be proved to be guilty of an overt act laid in the Indictment in which he had no personal pArticipation, byprovingtthat he advised it, or that he committed other acts.
This is, perhaps, tdo extravagant to be in terms maintained. Certainly it cann6s besupported by the doctrines of the English.law.

vise a treasonable assemblage, and to be one of that assmblage, are certainly distinct acts, and therefore ought not to be charged as the samb act. The great objection to this mode of proceeding is, that the proof essentially varies from the charge in the character and essence of the oflence, and in the testimony by which the accused is to defend himselk. Tlese dicta of Lord Hale, therefore,- taken in the extent in which they are understood by the counsel for the United States seem to be repugnant to the declarations we find every where, that an.overt act must be laid, and must be proved. No case is cited by Hale in support of them, and I am strongly inclined to the opinion that, had the public received his corrected; instead of his original manuscript, they would, if not expunged, have been restrained in their applica-
tion to cases of a particular description. Laid down generally, and applied to all cases of treason, they are repugnant to the principles for %hich Hale
contends, fpr which all the elementary writers contend, and from which courts have in no' case, either directly reported or referred to in the books, ever departed. These principles are, that the indictment must give notice of the
offence : that the -accused is only bound to answer the particular charge which the indictment contains, and that the overt act laid is that pai-ticular charge. Under such circumstances, it is only doing justie to Hale to examine his dicta, and if they will admit of being uniderstood in a limited sense, not'repagnart to, his own doctrines, nor to the general principles of'law, to understand them in that sense.

"If many conspire to counterfeit, or counsel or abet it, and one of them doth the fact upon that counselling or conspiracy, it is treason in all, and they may be all indicted for counterfeiting generdly within the statute, for in such case, in treason, all are principals'

This is laid down as applicable singly to the treason of counterfeiting the coin, and is not applied by Hale to other treasons. Had lie designed to apply the principle universally, he would have stated it as a general proposition ; he Would have laid it down in treating on other branches of the statute, us well as in the chapter respecting the coin ; lie would have laid it down when treating on indictments generally. But he has done neither. Every senti-
ment bearingin any manner onthis point,' which is to be found in Lord Hale, while on the doctrine of levying war, or on the general doctrine of indict-
ments, militates against the opinion that he eonsidered the proposition as more extensive than he has declared it to be. No court could be justified in extending the dictum of a judge beyond its terms, to caqes in which he has
expressly treated, to which he has not himself applied it, and on which he as well as others has delivered opinions which that dictum wduld overrule.
This would be the less justifiable-if there should be a clear legdI distinction indicated -by the very terms in -which the judge has expressed himself between the particular case to which alone he has applied .the dictum, and other cases to which the court is requiredto extend it.

There is this clear legal distinction. "cThey may," says Judge Halei "1be indicted for counterfeiting generally." But if many conspire to levy war, aid some actually levy it, they may not be indicted for levying war generally.
The books.concur in declaring that they cannot be so indicted. A special overt act of levying war must be laid. This distinction between counterfeting the coins, and that class of treasons among which levying war is placed, is takeii in the statutd of Edward HI. That statute reiuilres 'n

ovei'tact of levyingwar t6 be laid in thi inditrnent, and does not require an overt,act of counterfeiting the coin td be laid. If in Aparticular case where a general -indictment iHsufficient, it be stated that the"crime' may be charged
generally according to the legal effect of the act, it does not followt that in
other cases where a general indictmeit would be insufficient, where nn overt *act must be laid, that this over-tact need not be laid according tb tilreeal fact.
Hale, then, is to be reconciled with himself, and 4th the general priliciples of law, only by'permitting the limits which he has himself given to his own -,dictum, to remain where he hab placed them.

In p. 298. Hale is speaking generally' of the receiver of a traitor, and is, stating in what such receiver partakes of an accessary. 1st. a His indictment must be special of the neceipt) and not generally that he did the thirig, which may be otherviise in case of one that is procur~r, counsollor or consenter."

The words " may be otherwise" do not clearly convey the Idea that it is universally 'otherwise. n all cases of a.receiver the indictment' must be
special on the receipt, and not general. The words it thbmeaoytherwise in case of a procurer," &c. signify that it may be otherwise in lltreasons, or that it may be otherwise in some treasons. If it may be otherwise in some treasons. without, contradicting the doctrines of Hide himself, as well its of other writers, but cannot be otherwise in all treasons witliout such contradic-
tion, the fair construction is, that Hale used these words in their restricted sense ;-that hie used them lifi reference to treasons. in which a general illdicttnent would lie, not to treasonts where a general indictment would not lie, but an.overt" act of the treason must*be charged. The two passages of Hile thus construed, may perhaps be law, and may leave him consistent -with bimself. It appears to the court to be the fair way of construing-them.

These. observations relative to the passages quoted from Hale, apply to th'kt quoted from East, who obviously copies from Hale, and relies upon his authority.
Upon this point Keeling 46. hild 1 Hale, 626. have, also been relied upon, It is. stated in both, that if a man be indicted as a principal and acquitted, he cannot af.tervards be iqdicted as accessafy before the fact. Whence It Is inferred, not without reason, that evidence of aiccessorial guilt may be rec'eivedon such an indictnment. Yetno case is found in which the question has been mrade and decided. The objection has never been taken' at a trial and overruledi nor do the bobks say. it would be overruled. Were such a case produced its application would lie questionable. Krolin. says, an accessary before the fact is quodam-modo, in some manner guilty of the fact. The law may not require that the mrinner' should be stated, for in felony it does not require that an overt kct should-be laid. The indinttment therefore may be general. But ahovert act of levying war mut be laid. These cases then prove in thpir utmost extent no Tpore than the ,ases previously cited from
ale and-East. This distinction betweetn indittments whiph may state the fact generally, and those which'7nuh% lay it specially, beat- some analogy to
a general and.a special iction Pa the case. In a je icral action, the declaraion may lay-the assunapsit 'according to the legal effect of the transaction, but in a.spe ial hction on the case, the declaration must state tile materil, circumstances truly, and they. must be proved as' stated. This distinction also c-eives some aid from a passage in Htde, 625. immediately preueding

that which has been cited at the bar. He says, " If A. be indicted as principal, and B. as accessary before or after, and both be acquitted, yet B. may be indicted as principal, and the former acquittal, as accebsary is no bar.

The crimes, then, -are not the same, and may not indifferently be tried under the same indictment. But why is it that an acquittal as principal may be pleaded in bar to an indictmfent as accessary, whi e in acquittal as accesgary may not be pleaded in bar to an indictment as principal ? If it be answered that the accessorial crime may be given in evidence on an. indictment as principal, but that the principal crime may not be given in evidence on aa indictment as accessary, the question recurs, on what legal'ground does this distinction stand ? I can imagine only this. An accessary being quodqm modo a principal, in indictments where the law does not require the manner to be stated, which need not b'especial, evidence of accessorial guilt, if the punishmentbe the same,-may possibly be received ; but.every indictment as an accessary must be special The very allegation that he is an accessary must be a special allqgation, and must show how he became an accessary. The charges of this special indictment, therefore2 must be proved as laid, and no evidence which proves the crime in a form substantially different can be received. If this be the legal reason for the distinction, it supports the exposition of these dicta which has been given. If it be not the legal reason, Ican conceive no 6ther.
But suppose the law to be as is contended by the counsel for the United States. Suppose an indictment, charging an individual with personally assembling among others, and thus levying war, may be satisfied with the proof that he caused the assemblage. What effect will this law have upon this case ?
Th-e guilt of the accused, if there be any guilt, does not consist in the as6emblage, for he was not a member of it. The simple fact of assemblage no more affects one absent man than another. His gtuilt then consists in procuring -theassemblage, and upon this fact depends his criminality. The proof rela-' tive to the character of an assemblage must be the same whether a roan be present or absent. In thegeneral, to charge any individual with the guilt of an assemblage, the fact of his presence must be proved. It constitutes an essential part of the overt act. If then the procurement be substituted in the place of presence, does it not also constitute an essential part of 4he dvert act ? 1Must it not also be proved ? Must it not he proved in the same nianner that presencemustbe proved? If in one case the presence of the individual Makes the guilt of the assemblage his guilt, and in .the other caise the procurement by the individual makes the guilt of the assemblage his guilt, then presence aId procurement are equally, component parts of the overt act, and equally require two witnesses.
Colfateral points may, say the books, be proved according to the course of the common law - but is this a collateral point'? Is the fact, without which the accusel does notparticipate in the guilt of the assemblage if it wasguilty, a'collateral point? This cannot be. The presence of the p' rtv. where presence is necessary, being a part of the overt act, must be positi ely provedby two witnesses. No presumptive evidence, no facts from which presence may he c.onjecjured or inferred, will satisfy the constitution and the law. If pro-

APPENDIX.
curement take the' place of presence, and become part of the overt act, then no presumptive-evidence, no facts from which the procurement may be conjectured or inferred, can satisfy the constittion and the law. The mind is not to be led to the conchlsion that the individual was present, by a train of conjectures or inferences, or of rdasoning: the fact must be roved by two witnesscs. Neithel where procurement supplies the want of presence, Is the mind to be conducted to the conclusion that the accused procured the dssembly, by a train of conjectures or inferences, or of reasoning ;the fact itself must.be proved by two vitnesses, and must have been committed within tile district.
If it be said that the advising or procurement of treason is a secret transnc. tion'which can scarcely ever be proved in the manner required bylthis opinion ; the answer which will readily suggest itself is, that the difficlulty of peoving a fact will not justify conviction without proof. Certainly it will not justify con. viction without a direct and positive witness in a case where the bonstitution requires two. The more correct inference ffom this circumstance would seem to be, that the advising of the fact is not within the constitutional definition of the crime. To .advise oi procuri a treason is in the nature of contspiring or plotting treason, ivhich.is not treason in itself.
If then the doctrines of Keeling, Hale land East are to be understood In the sense in which they are-pressed by the counsel for the prosecution, and are applicable in hq*U ted States, the fact that the accused procured the assemblage on Blennerhassett's island- must be proved, not circumstantially, but positively by two witnesses, io charge him with that assemblage. But there are still other most important considerations, which must be well weighed before-this doctrine can be applied to the United States.
The eighth amendment to the -constitution has been pressed with great force, and it is impossible not to feel its application to this point. The accused cannot be truly said to be " informed of the nature and cause of the accusation," unless the indictment shall give him that notice which may reasonably suggest to him the point-on which the accusation turns, so that he may know the course to be pursued in his defence.
It is also well worthy of consideration, that this doctrine, so far as it respects treason, is entirely supported by the operation of tlie common law, whlch is said to convert the accessary before the fact into the principal, and to make the act of the'principal his act. The ac6essary before the fact isnot said to have levipd war. He'is not said to be guilty under the statute. But the comTnon law attaches to him the guilt of that fact which he has adviged or procured, an , as contended, makes it his act. This is the operation of the common law, not the operation of the statute. 'Iits an operation then which can only be performed where the common law exists to perform it.It is the crenture of the common law, and-the creature presupposes its creator. To decide then that this doctrine is applicable to the United States, would seem to imply the decision that the United Sttes asa natioq, have a common law wich creates and defines the punishment of crimes accessorial in their nature. It would imply the further decisions that these accessorial crlres are not, in the case of treason, excluded by -thedefinition of treason Oiven in the constitution, twill not pretend tmat I have not itdividually an opinion on these points, b .

A is one which I should give only in a case absolutely requiring it, unless Icould confer respecting it with the judges of-the supreme court.
I have said that this doctrine cannot apply to the United States, without implying those decisions respecting the common law which I have stated, because, should it be true, as is contended, that the constt.ttional defidition of treason comprehends him who advises or procures an assemblage that levies wvar, it would not follow that such adviser or procurer might be charged as having been present at the assemblage. If the adviser or procurer is within the definition of levying war, and, independent of the agency of tlt common law, does actually levy war, then the advisement or procurement is an overt act olevying war. If it be the overt act on which he is to be convicted, then it must be charged in the indictment, for he can only be convicted on proof of the overt acts *hich are charged.
*fVo render this distinGtion more intelligible, let it be retollected, thaL although it should be conceded that since the statute of William and Mary, he who advises or procures a treason may in.England *becharged as having committed that treason, by virtue of the common law operation, which is said, so far as respects the indictment, to unite the accessorial to the principal ofTence, and permit them to be charged as one, yet it can never be conceded that ie who commits one overt act under the statute of Edward, can be charged and convicted on proof of another overt act. If then procurement he an overtaact of treason under the constitution, no man can be convicted for the procurement under an indictment, charging him with actually assembling, whatever may be the doctrine of the common law in the case- of an accessorial offender.
It may not be improper in this place again to tdvert to the opinion of the supreme court, and to show that it contains nothing contrary to the doctrine now laid down. That'opinion is, that an individual may be guilty of treason 'who has notappeared in arms against his country ; that if var be actually levied;'that is, if a body of men be actually assenbled for the purpose of effecting by force a treasonable object, all those who perform. any part, however minute, or however remote from the §cene of action, and- who ane actually leagued in the general conspiracy, are to be considered as traitors."
This opinion does not touch the case of a person who advises or procures an -assemblage, and does nothing further. The advising certainly, and perhaps the procuring, is more in the nature of a conspiracy to levy war, than of the actual levying of war. According to the opinion, it is not enough to be leagued in the conspiracy, and that war be levied, but it is also necessary to perform a part; that part is the act of levying war. This part, it is true, may be minute it may not be the actual appearance in arms, andit may be remote from the scene of action, that is, from the place whei'e the army is assembled ; but it must be a part, and that part must be performed by a person who is leagued in the, conspiracy. This part, however minute or remote, constililtes the overt act on which alone the person who performs it can be convicted.
The opinion does not declaie that the person who has performed this remote and minute part may. be indicted for a part which was in truth per-

formed by others, and convicted, on their overt acts. It amounts to this and nothWing more, that when war isactually levied, not only those'whio bear arms,
but those also wifo are.leagued inthe conspiracy, and who perform the various distinct parts which are necessary for th6 prosecution of war, do in the senso of the constitution levy war. It may possibly be the bpinion of the supreme court, that thosn who procUre'a treasoa, and do nothing further, are guilty under the constitution ; I -only say that opinion has not .yetbeen given ; stll less has it been indicated, that he who advise shall be iidicted as having performed the fact.

It is then the opinion of the court, that tlFs indictment can be supported only by-icstimony which Iroes the accused to have been actually or constructively present when the assemblage'took place on.Blennerhassett's island, or by the admission of the doctrine that he who procures an act may be indicted as having performed, that act.

Itis further the opinion of the court, that there is no testimony whatever which tends to prove that the 'accused was actually. or constructively present when that assemblagcAid take place. Indeed the contrary is most apparent. With respect to admitting proof of procurenent to establish a charge of actual presence, the court.is of opinion, that if this be admissible in England on an indictmentfor levying war, which is far from being conceded, it is admissible only by virtue of the operation of the common'lav upon the statute, and therefore is not admissible in this country. unless by virtue of a slmilqr operation; a point far from being established, but on which, for the present, no opinion is given. If, however, thispoint be established, still the procurement must be proved in the same manner, and by the same.Iind of testimony which 'would be reqnired to prove actual pr-esence.
The second point in this division of the subject is the necessity of' adducing the record of the previous conviction of iome one person who committed the fact alleged to be treasonable.

This point presupposes the treason of the act used, if any hag been committed, to be accessorial in its nature. Its being of this description accordig to the British authorities, depends on the presence or absence of the accused ait the time the fact was committed. The doctrine on this subject is well understood, has been most copiously explained, and ,need not be repeated. ,That there is no evidence of his actual .or legal presence is a point already discussed and deci'ded. It is then apparent that; but for the exception to the general principle which is made in cases of treason, those who assembled at Blennerhassett's island, if that assemblage was such 'as to constitute the crime, would be principals, and those who might really have caused that assemblage; although in truth the chief traitors, would iMlaw be neces-
saries.

It is a settled principle in the law that the nccessary cailnot be guilty of a greater offence thtrn his principal. The maxim is accesmariu aequiturnaturam suizrincitqiU8; the accessary follows thenature of his principal. H:ence results the necessity .ofestabliliing the guilt of the principal before the, accessary
can be tried. For the degree of guilt which is incurred by coufisellifg or commanlding the .commission of a-crime depends upon tle actual cominisliori

APPENDIX.

of'lhat crime. "Noman, s an accessary to murder unless the fact hal been committed.
The fact can only be established in a prosecution against the person by 'whom a crime has been perpetrated. The law supposes a man more capable of defending 'his own conduct than any other person, and will not toleratethat the guilt of A. shall be established in a prosecution against B. Consequently, if the guilt of B. depends on the guilt of A. A. must be convicted before B. can be tried. It would exhibit a monstrous deformity, iidee1d, in our systemh, if B. might be executed for being accessary to a murder committed by A. and A. should afterwards, upon a full trial, be acquitted of the fact. For this obvious reason; although the punishment of a prncipal and accessary was originally the same, and although in maqy instances it is itill the same, the accessary could in no case be tried before the conviction of his principal, nor can he yet be tried previous to such conviction, unless he requires it, or unless a special provision to that effect be made by statute.
If, then, this was a felony, the prisoner at the bar could not be tried until the crime was establishied by the conviction of the.person by whom it vas actually perpetrated.
Is the law otherwise in this case, because in treason all are principals ?

Let this question-be answered by reason and by authority.
Why is it that in felonies however atrocious, the trial of the accessary can never precede the conviction of the principal? Not because the one is deno minated the principal adld the other the accessary- for That would be grmd on which a great law principle could never stand. Not because there was in fact a di&rence in the degree df moral guilt, for in the case of murder committed by a hardy villain'tor a bribe, the-.person plotting the murder and givingthebribe, is, perhaps, of the two the blacker criminal; and) were it otherwise, this would furnish no argument for p.recedence in trial

What, then, is the reason ?
It has been already given. The legal guilt of the accessary depends on the guilt of the principal; and the guilt of'the p'rincipal can only be established in a prosecution againsthimself.
Does. not this reason apply in full fbrce to a case of treason ?

The legal guilt of the person who planned the assemblage on Blennerhassett's island depends, not simply on the criminality of the previous conspiracy, but on the criminality of that assemblage. If those who perpe-
trated the fact be not traitors, he who advised the fact cannot be a traitor. His guilt, then, in contemplation of law, depends on theirs, and their guilt
can only be established in a-prosecution against themselves. Whether the adviser of this assemblage be punishable with death as a principal or as nn
accessary, his liability to punishment depends on the degree of guilt attached to an act which has been perpetrated by others, and which, if it bo a

VoLtIV.

APPENDIX.
criminal act, renders them guilty also. His guilt therefore depcnds on theirs, and their guilt cannot be legally established in a prosecution against him.
I The whole reason of the law, then, relative to the principal and accessary, so far as respects the order of trinl, seems to apply in full force to a case of treason committed by one body of men in conspiracy. with others who arc absent.
If from reason we pass to authority, we find it laid down by Hale, Foster, and East, in the most explicit terms, that the conviction of some one who sas-committed the treasor must precede the trial-of him who has advised or. procured it. This position is also maintained by Leach in his notes on Hawkins, and is not, so far as the court has discovered, any where contradicted.
These authorities have been read and commented on at such length, that it cannot be necesiary for the court to bring them again into view. It is the less necessary, because it is not understood that the law is contrbverted by the counsel for the United States.
It is, however, contended, that the prisoner has waived his right to demand the conviction of some one person who was present at the fact, by pleading to his indictment.
Had this indictment even charged the prisoner according to the truth of the case, the court would feel some difficulty in deciding that lie had by Implicacation waived his right to demand a species of testimony essential to his conviction. -The court is not prepared to sa that the act which is to operata a.gainst his rights did not require that it should be performed with a full
knowledge of its operation. It would seem consonant to the usual course of proceeding in other respects, in criminal cases; that the prisoner should be informed that he had a right to refuse to be tried until some person 'who committed the act should be convicted, and that lie ought not to be consideted as waiving the right to demand the record of conviction, unless with the full knowledge of that right he consented to be tried. The court, how-ver, does not decide what the lpw would be in such a case. It is unnecessary to decide it, because pleadhig to an indictment in which a man Is pharged as having committed an act, cannbt be construed to waive a right vhich he would have possessed, had he been charged with having advised th6 act. No *person indicted as a principal can be expected to say I am not a principal,. I am an accessary; I'did not commit, I only advised the act.
The authority of.the English cases on this subject depends in a great measure on the adoption of the common law doctrine of.acceisorial treasons. If that doctrine be excluled, this, branch of it may not be directly applicable to treasons committed within the United States. If the crime of advising or procuring a levying of war be within the constitutional definition" of treason, then lie who advises or procures it must be-indictcd ofi the very fact, and the questiob whether the treasonablehess of'the.act may be decided in the first instance in the trial of him who procured it, or must be decided in the trial of one who committed it, will depend upon the rvason, as it respects the law

of evidence, which produced the British decisroul 'with regard to the trial of principal and accetsary, rather than on the positive authority of those
decisions.

This question is not essential in the present case, because it tne crime be within the constitutional definition, it is an overt act of levying war, and to produce a conviction -ought to have been charged in the indictment:

The law of the case being thus far settled, what ought to be the decisioa of the court on the present motion ? Ought the court to set and hear testi-
mony which cannot affect the prisoner, or ought the court to arrest that testimony ? On this question much has been sai&-much that may perhaps be ascribed to a misconception of the point really under consideration. -The motion has been treated as a motion confessedly made to stop relevant testimony, and in the course of the argument, it has been repeatedly stated by those who oppose the motion, that irrelevant testimony may and ought to be stopped. That this statement is perfectly correct, is one of thom fundamental principles in judicial proceedings which is acknowledged by all, and is founded in the absolute necessity of the thing.. No person A'rIl contend that in a civil or criminal case, either party is at liberty to introduce what testimony he pleases, legal or illegal, and to consume the whole term in details of facts unconnected with the particular case. Some tribunal, then, must decide on the admissibility of testimony. The parties cannot constitute this tribunal, for they do not agree. The jury cannot constitute it, for the question is whether they shall hear the testimony or not. Who, then, but the court can constitute it? It is of necessity the peculiar province of the court
to judge of the admissibility of testimony. If the court admit improper or reject proper testimony, it is an error of judgment, but it is an error committed in the direct exercise of their judicial functions,

The present indictment charges the prisoner with levying war against the United States, and alleges an overt act of levying war. That overt act must be proved, according to the mandates of the constitution add of the act of congress, by two witnesses. It is not proved by. a single witness. The presence of the accused has been stated to be an essential component phrt of the overt' act in this indictment, unless the common law principle respecting
accessaries should render it unnecessary ; and there is nt only no witneps who has proved his actual or legal presence; but the fact of his absence is not controverted. The counsel for the prosecution offer to give in evidence subsequent transactions, at a different place, and in a different state, in order to prove' what? The overt act laid in the indictment ? That the prisoner
was one of those who assembled at Blennerhassett's island? No, that is not alldged. It is well known that such testimony is not competent to establish such a fact., The constitution and law require that the fact should be established by two witnesses, not by the establishment of other facts from which the jury might reason to this fact. The testimony, then, is not relevant. If
it can be introduced, it is only in the character of corroborative or confirmatory testimony, after the overt act has been proved by two witnesses, in such manner that the -question of fact ought to be left with the jury. The con-
clusion that in this state of things no testimony can be admissible, is so Inevitable, that the counsel for the United States could not resist it. I do not understand them to deny, that if the overt act be not proved by two wit-
nesses so as to be submitted to the jury, that all other testimony mst be

506

APPENDIX

Irrelevant, because no other testimony can prove tbhe act. Novi an assemblage on blennerbassett's island is proved by the requisite number of wtlebscs, -and the court might submit it to the jury, whether that assemblage amounted .to a levying of war, but the presence of the accused at that asemblagebeing no where-alleged except in the indictment, the overt act is not provcd by a single witness, and of consequence, all other testimony must be irrelevant.
The only difference between this motion as made, and the motion in the form which the counsel for the United States would admit to be regular, is this. It is now general for the rejection of all testimony. It might be particular with respect to each witness as adduced. But can this-be wished, or can it be deemed necessary ? If enough is proved' to show that the ildict.meut cannot be supported, and that no testimony unless it be of that description which the attorney for the United States declares himself not to possess can be relevanti why should a question be.taken on each witness?'
The opinion of this court on the order of testimony has frequently been adverted to as deciding this question against the motion.
If a contradiction between the two opinions does exist, the court cannot perceive it. It was said that levying war is an act compounded of law and fact, of whch thd jury; aided by the court, must judge. To that declaration the court still adheres.
It was saiid that if the overt act was not proved by two witnesses, no testimony in its nature corroborative or confirmatory, was admissible, or could be relevant.

From that declaration there is certainly no departure. It has'been asked, in allusion to the present case, if a general commanding an army should dc. tach troops for a distant service, would the men composing that detachment be traitors, and would the commander in chief escape punishment?
Let the opinion which has been given answer this question. Appearing at the head of an army would, according to this opinion, be an overt act of levying war; detaching a military corps from it for military purposes might also be an overt act of levying war. It is not pretended that he would not be pui-ishbld for these acts, it is only said that he may be tried and convicted on his own acts, in the state where those acts were committed, not on -the act. of othek's in the state where those others acted.
Much has been said in the course of the argument on points, on which the court feels no inclination to comment particularly, but which may, perhaps not improperly, receive some notice.
That this court dares not usurp power is most true.
-Thatthis court dares not shrink from its duty is not less true.
Noman is desirous of placing himself ina disagreeable situation. Noman is desirous of becoming the peculiar subject of calumny. No man, might he * lef4hp bitter cqp pass from hin without a lf-reproach, would drain it to the

bottom. But i he has no choice in the case ; if there is no alternative presented to-him but a dereliction of duty, or the opprobium of those who are denominated the world, he merits the contempt as well as the indignation of his country, who can hesitate which to embrace.
That gentlemen, in a case the most interesting, in the zeal with which they advocate particular opinions, afid under the conviction in some measure pro. duced by that zeal, should on each side press their arguments too far, should be impatient at any deliberation in the court and should suspect or fear the operation of motives to which alone they can ascribe*that deliberation, is perhaps a frailty incident to human nature; but if any conduct on the part of the court could warrant a sentiment that they would deviate to the one side or the other from the line prescribed by duty arid by law, that conduct would be viewed by the judges themselves with an eye of extreme severity, and would long be recollected with deep and serious regret.
The arguments on both sides have been intently and deliberately considered. Those which could not be noticed, since to notice every argument and authority would swell this opinion to a volume, have not been disrogarded. The result of the whole is a conviction as complete as the mind of the court is capable of receiving on a complex subject, that the motion must prevail.
No testimony relative to the conduct or declarations of the prisoner elsewhere and subsequent to the transaction on Blennerh&sett's island, can.be admitted, because such testimony, being in its nature merely corroborative, and incompetent to prove the overt act in itself, is irrelevant, until there be proof of the overt act by two witnesses.
This opinion does not comprehend the proof by two witnesses that the meeting on Blennerhassett's island was procured by the prisoner. On that point the court, for the present, withholds its opinion for reasons which have been already assigned ; and as it is under~tood from the statepnents made ba the part of the prosecution, that no such testinrony exists. If there be such, let it be offered and the court will decide upon it.
The jury have now heard the opinion of the court on the law of the cae They will apply that law to the facts, and will find a verdict of guilty or not guilty as their own consciences.may direct.

OPINION
OF. aUfDGE JOHNSON, IN THE CIRCUIT COURT.
The following contains the statement of the case, and'the Judge'ereaoonsfor
the ddcrees given by him in th1 case. of Rove and. Himely, and Roae and
Groenings. ALTHOUGH there are three distinct libels filed in these cases, yet, in
the course of investigation, they are brought all to depend upon the same circumstances, and: were argued before me as one cause.
The two first'were decided in September last, when the copy of the condem. nation had not been received, and the decision of the district court rested upon the ground of a defect of condemnation. But upon a motion before this court for leave to adduce new evidence upon the appeal, I decided in favour of its admissibility, and the condemnation having been received before the expiration of the term probatory assigned the appellants, consistently with my' decision, I am to consider ;he condemnation as equally affecting the rights of the parties on all the three cases : at the hearing upon the appeal there was also a witness produced and sworn in behalf of the appellants, who testified that he was one of the officers of the capturing vessel, and that he sawiln pos. session of the captain a permit from the agent of the French government, resident at St. Jago de Cuba, to sell the Sarah and her cargo, and that she was advertised and sold by virtue of that'permit ; but I shall take no notice of this evidence in forming my opinion, because it appears to me subject to this objection, that a certificate of the granting of such a permit might have been obtained from the chancery of the agent himself, if there existcd such an officer, and he &itddone that act in an official capacity. Upon the hearing of the two first causes in the district court, the identity of the goods was also made a point, and a defect of evidence to prove their identity was strongly insisted

upon in the argument, but this ground was relinquished upon the appeal, ancL the only point contelted-was the right of property.

The following are -the circqmstances on which the court proceeds to form its decision, as they are collected from the libels), nswers, depositions and vritings in evidence:
The schooner barah. an American bottom, owned by-citizens of theUnited
States, sailed from Norfulk with a cargo consisting entirely of provisions, owned likewise by citizens of the United States. Whatever port she may have cleared for, her real destination was to the brigand ports in the Ailand of St. Domingo, several of which she entered, and havingdisposed of her outward cargo, took in return the sugar and coffee which is the subject of the suit i on her voyage from Port au Paix, one of the brigand ports, *shewas captured by a Trencli privateer and carried into Barracoa, where Henry Rose, thesupercargo, and now the libellant in these cases, purchased her of the captors. The principal part of the cargo was purchased by captain Cott, of the Example, lying then at,Barracoa, in behalf of the respondent, . J. Himely, and was transferred during the night from the Sarah to the Example. The Example having sailed for this port, she was followed by captaip Rose, and the sugar and coffee, shipped on board her from the'Srah, has bee.Jibelled on behalf of the original owners. Prior to the suing ouit the libel, a part 6f the-coffee had been sold to Messrs. L. and R. Groening, of this place, merchants, who are acknowledged to be innocent purchasers without notice ; but as the Bnlish doctrine relative to sales in market overt is unknown to the -laws of this state, it is not contended that trueir claim rests on any better groundthan that of Himely or Cott, the immediate purchasers from the cap"tors. It appears that when the cargo of.the Sarah was sold, no condemnation had taken place; 'that she- was afterwards libelled arid condemned at St. Domingothe 15th July, 1804; whe.-eas the vessel was captufed on the 23d February, the sale of the cargo took place on she 18th March, and it had arrived in this port, and a warrant actually issued and served upon it, the 4th May.pregceding. Upon examining the condemnation, it appears to be professedly founded upon an arrete of the captain-general Ferraud, dated Ist March, 1804, de-
c'laring the port of Santo Domingo to be the only free port in that ishnd, and directing the vessels of neutrals trading to any other port to bebrought toadjudication.

It was indeed asserted in the argument, and I believe was the fact, that geneiral Le'Clerc had formerly issued a similar arrete, but there wasn6t then, nor is thler6 now adduced, any evidence to prove it to the satisfactiem of tho court, nor does it appear to be one of those facts of general notoriety, 'which this court is sanctioned in noticing as such.
On behalf of the claimants it is contended, that there is an original defect in the title of the libellants, as the property appears to have been purchased from revolted slaves, a description of people who could not possets, and, of course, could not convey a right of property to another. That there is a turpitude in this trade, which oughtto predispose this court to discountenance the pretensions of the libellants. That if the libellants ever possessed a right, it was defeated by the capture, which alone gave them a possession nt to be violated by us; if t.wjt by the capture, by the carrying infra /fresidicr; if not by carrying infrairisidix,by the effect of the condemvat-ion

APPENDIX.
For the libellants it was argued,
That.there could be no original defect in the title acquired from the brigands, because kpower existing defacto is, as to neutrals, a power dejure.
That the silbjects of the existing government of Hayti were a mixt multitude of slaves and coloured freemen, the latter of whom, before the rcvblulon, possessed extensive estates, and who, for aught we know, may have been the vendors of these articles.
That the law of nations knows no such description of people as slaves, and it is not in fact every description of slaves who are destitute of rights of pro. perty ; even within the bounds of the United States, widely different are tile epinions entertained, and laws existing, on this subject, and the decisions of the court would fluctuate according to the state in which the decisions took place, and the judge who presided.
That if there is turpitude in the trade to the brigand ports, there Is an equal degree-in the conduct of the claimants, in lyingin wait to draw a profit from the ravages on 6ur commerce, and in the clandestine manner in wyhich the cwgo wyia *-ansferred from the one vessel to the other.
That the property of the libellants would not be divested by the capture or carrying infra preaidia,because a sentence of condemnation is indispensably necessary to change the property.
. hat this sentence of condemnation could not operate to produce that effec4 because.
1st. Before the condemnation, the captors had parted with that posses. sion which alone could give the court its prize jurisdiction over the property.
2d. Because, befor6 the condemnation, it had actually returned within the jurisdiction of our own courts, and thus became revested by the jus fast.
o; Because the sentence of condemnation appears on the face of it to bo incisistent with every idea of. law and justice, inasmuch as the- fact was cominitted before the arrete was passed which was made the foundatioi of the sentence.
4th. Because it is in direct violation of the 12th article of the convention with France, inasmuch as the trade to Port au Prince was a trade to a port of an enemy'of France, which is sanctioned, under certain restrictions, by that article; also of the 22d article, which enjoins that the adjudication of American vessels captured shall be made by thetribunals of the country Into which the prize shall be*carried; also, inasmuch as the 22d article has also been violated, which prohibits the sale of goods captured previous to adjudication by a competent authority.
Withdut considering these arguments in detail, I shall recur to principles adopted by the district court in its deisions, and afterwards cursorily examine

APPE NDIX.

%uchof the arguments of counsel as shall not appear tame to be disposed of by my previous observations.

In the decree of September, 1804, there are three questions considered.

Ist Whether the libellants could 4cquire any legal interest by a purchase from the brigands ?
2d. Whether the capture and firm possdssion, without a condepnnation, would convey a. title to the claimants which this court could not violate?

-2d. The question of identity.

The last of these questions has been relinqqished upon the appeal. The second no lenger exists, since the production of the condemnation ; and on the first I would only remark,.that it is too much of a refinement upon the acquisition of property in commercial transactions, especially in the purchase of the products of the earth from the actual possessors and cultivators of the soil ; anid it is conclusive against the doctrine on this point insisted on for the claimants, that even th Frelich courts have not ventured to-adopt sach 6i
principle. But I must here exprms my dissent fr.ni the opinion of my much r-spected 4ssociate in this court, in tlhe decision Made by him in the court below on this point; to wit, that he had. no jurisdiction of-th question ; -because# that whenever a court has a jurisdiction of the prin~pal subject of a suit, it must of necessity d~ide upon all questions whichi occur in the course of investigation, andjhavq any bearing upon the principal cause of action. Had, the libefllnts never, gcqqired any legal interest in this property, it is Plain thaf
their suit must have bren hismissed, without any inquiry into the subsequent
occurences.

Ia the decr#e.-of April, t803, thv only subject c9n~idered vas the effect of tme decree of condemnation, and- it was diclared irrelevant-upop twvo grounds.

1st. Because upon the face of it, it appears to have been founded on an ordinance. passed subsequent to the commission of the act for which the vessel and cargo were condemned.

2d.-Because the property was actually brought within the jurisdiction of the (-nited.States befo:e the sentence of condemnation wvas pronounced.

upon considering the first of the grounds, it will be immediately perceived that it supposes two things, viz.

That a decree of a foreign court is examinable, and that it derives its va-. Udity only from its con'ectness-doctrines which, in my opinion, cmn in no wise be maintained. The respect required to be shewn to the decrees of

foreign tribunals is not founded upon the mere comity ofinations ; it has for its f diind-tion that qniversal equality and independence of nil gnvernments

from which it results, as Vattel observes, "that to undertake to examine the

. Vol. IV.

3 T

APPENDIX,
ustice 6fa definitive sentence, is an attack on the jurisdictlon of him who passed it." It beconpes, therefore, an absolute right of nations, as universal as the principle on which it deplends, and one which we cantot dispense with .oncedinig, " That decisions made by the judge of the plate, within the extent Af his ipowers, shall be considered as jubtly made." Not being at liberty, us it were, to lift the mantle of justice cast -upon their decrees, it Is, as to, other tribunals of justice, immaterial wfiterrors it covers; neither the fallibility of the judge, the perjury of witnesses, nor-the oppressio and injustice of nations', will sanctioh a deviation fiom this general rule : And, perhaps, If this. doctrine -were not, deducible from any fixed principle, nations must .ong since have adopted it frdm a necessary attention to getieral convenience: 9ur, otherwise, the sentence which I am now considering might perhaps again ie reviewed in the courts of Santo Domingo, and from thence return to our %wnjurisdiction, after making the circuit of all the courts of Europe.
A question will no doubt here suggest itself to those who hear me,. are out 'itizens then bound t6 acquiesce under every species of injustice ? and dio hey sue in vain to our courts for relief? -The answer is, while our govern.pent makies one of the society of nations, we are bound to submit to the obligaion of those rules which that society has assumed fortheir government ; rules which tre founded in truth an&wisdom, dnd, but for the misapplication of fraud and flagitiousness of power, are well calculated to prodtice the best efrects.
It is not in our courts that redress is to be sought for the errors or injustice of foreign adjudictions. Nations pledge to each other the lives the fortunes of their citizens, t nd even their very national existence, for the Integrity and correctness of thtir judicial tribunals, and " when justice is refused, or palpable and evident injustice done, or. rules and forms openl)'ylolated, or an odious distinction adopted to the prejudice of the subjects of another," and negotiation for sbtisfaction fails, the appeal lies to the ultima ratio of nations..
The government is bound to extqnd a protecting a'm to her citizens, whilst confining themselves' strictly Witifin the limits of their duty, and to make compensation to them for such injuries as policy may withhold her from resenting.
The jui'isdiction of the court of admiralty is of a peculiar nhture. Acting wholly in rein and iot- afidcting the rights of any persons whomsoaver except so far as'they exist in the thing which irtlh subject of the libel, its decrees A.re laid down to be'conclusive against all the world-a doctrine which, us to the right of property in the subject libelled, is strictly and universally correct, " Wbenevdr the court is crected wihin the jurisdictional limits of t~le power which'cornstitutes it,whep the subject is of admiralty jurisdiction, and the' coui-t professes to sit and'judge according to the law of natlops, and the style'of the admiralty." ' or must it be supposed that to produce this "effect upon the right of properiy, 'the decision of thd court must be fornmed upon a just idea of the law of nations, as applies to any-particular case; a decision founded'upon an erroneous opinion'will be as efficient, in that respect, a" one which flows from the most unerring judgment: Itis the"thing decreed that coturts ofjutic, are toiook to, not to the reuisons from whence the conclusionis are deduced.

APPENDIX.

Governments will indeed examine into the correctness of proceedings Igaiust their citizens, and insist on satisfaction, or dissolve, the bonds of peace.
It remains for me to -,onsi er the second of the principles upon which the court below founded its decree of April last, in favour of the libellants, to wit, " That as the liroperty of the actors was actually brought into their own jurisdiction long before anyjudicial decision had. taken place elsewhere, and the marshal of this court had the custody of it at least three months prior to any such decision, that alone might have been good cause for ordering restitution."
In the argument upon this head, the counsel contended that it was the pos. session alone which could bring the subject within the jurisdiction of the cout t of adrdiralty which condemned it; that in parting with the polscssion, by the sale, the court then lost it&jurisdiction, and could not affect the riht of property by'their decree. The court below; without adopting this idea m the extent contended for, appears to assume another, to wit, that coming within our jurisdiction, it could nolonger be subject to the court of Francee and the property revested by thejusftostIiini. I am sorry here again to be under the necessity of adopting a different opinion. Mere locality will not of itself deprive the prize court of one nation of its jurisdiction, nor give jurisdiction to another. The taking as prize is the foundation of admiraltyjurisdiction. A. prize brought into our ports by a belligerent continues subject to thejurisdiction of the capturing power, although the corpus be within the,limio of another jurisdiction; and it is now the general practice of European nations to condemn intheir dwn courts captured vessels carried into the portsof an ally or even aneutral. On the otherhand, a prize brought into our ports would be in no wise subjected by that circumstance to oui jurisdiction, except perhaps in the singlecase of its being necessa'ry to assume ajurisdiction to protect our neutrality or sovereignty ; as in the case of capture within our jurisdic.tional limits, or by vessels fitted out in our ports. Nor does it appear to me that thejus Postiminii can" at all attach in this case, because that this capture wan not a reprisal upon us as a nation, hut ul on a single offendin& individual in the commission of an act unauthorised by his nation' 'o satis the mind on this subject, it is necessary to inquire wlhat is the liability of an individual ai a neutral'state, wh6 commits an act inconsistent with °his neutrality, or even with the municipal laws of anothei nation ? How is his state affected by his conduct, and who is to decide upon the offence with which.he is charged? As to the tribunal that munt determine on the offence, there is no longer a contrariety of opinion entertained among civilized nations. Every nation is the arbiter and vindicator of its own rights, and the courts of the capturing power
have exclusiie jurisdiction of questions arisiQg on supposed breaches of neutrality,.the violation of belligerent rights, or even of municipal la~v. With regard to tle liability of individuals charged with these offences, it is proper to observe that in strictness every nation is bound to restrain its own citiLens from thq commission of offences against all other nations. But as it'is impossible, in the present state of things, for the most vigilant government to prevent these aggressions, which a desire of gain and the spirit of adventure arm hourly producing, nations hive agreed ingiving up the individual to the consequences of his owvn temenity, and the offender is now treated as an individual enemy, abandoned by his own government, and who cannot ever claim the rights of war, but from the humanity or policy of his captor. A considert

514

AT P E N D IX.

-tion whichwill set this idea in-a strong dint of view, and shew that he is considered as waging ah individual war with the capturing belligerent, is, that If he escapes or rescues his-vessel after capture, he is never demanded of his govednmetit, nor complaint miade against him, whatever acts df violence he' may commit in so doing, but avoids the danger as another enemy would under sbj;ilar circumstances.
'If an American vessel charged with a breach of neutrality, were to be captuied by a belligerent beyond ou jurisdictional limits) and, before condemnation were to be driven into one 6f our ports, eiftier by stress of Weather, or the pursuit of any enemy, will it be contended that this court could interfere to divest the captor of his possession ? It must be recollected that such an attempt would draw to this court the jurisdiction of a question vhich It is thq acknowledged right of the belligerent to have decided by his own tribunals. Thirefore, in the case-of a neutral captured dn a charge of a breach of neutrality, the.jze Postihniniican only attach in case of rescue or recapture, and'his nation cannot interfere to restore him that possession which he has lost by the capture, without becoming a party in. the contest ; she re,ards the individual and capturing power as belligerents, between whom she is bound equally to observe the laws of neutrality, and particularly to consider.possession 'as the criterion of right, at least while the cause of capture is In its progress to adjbdication. It will be perceived how large a portion-of-the argument went to justify and condemn the trade in ,which this Vessel was engaged'; the one side contending that the libellants had committed no act for which she was liable to colideoination ; the other, that they had a question which is exclusively cognisable in the courts of the capturing vower, but which this court would be coinpelled todecide upon if the libel
sustained upon- a claim interposed on behalf of the captors, or even, I 'conueive, of, their veridee, unless there were reason to contend that the vestelwds piratically captured.

At the same time I heartily concur.in the opinion that as far as between tneutrals, at least a sentence of -condemnatiop is indispensably necessary to produce a complete divesturcof property, and unless the neutral property captured, be put in a train for legal adjudication, I should think a nation at
liberty to seize it as being. piratically taken, for the capturing power is bound to satisfy the neutral nation that she had a legal right to attack her citizen ; and it will be found upon reflection, that this cannot be satisfactorily dono in any other tiode than by a decree of her tribunals of justice. Much ha "been said about the different rules adopted by European nations respecting 'the divestdre of property. -These rules were univef'silly adopted by the respectiVe nations to regulate the claims of their own citizens in questions ot salvage and restitution. In -case of alliances in war, each nation extendedto
its allv the benefit of a rule which ascertainM.the rights of her own cliizens, And the correctness of these rules was mere matter 'o4 speculation In no wise affecting the interests of neutrals, until'Great Britain thought propel' 'in' the last war to exact a salvage on the rtcapturc of neutrab property, TIere appear to me to'remain but two of the points mat6 by counsel, on Which it may be necessary for me to remark.

APPENDIX.
Ist. Hoio far the sentence of condemnation would affect the property after the sale.
2d. Whether the whole transaction was not inconsistent with the treaty subsisting between the two nations, and. therefdre producing no change of property ?
1st. In the.case of Sheafe and Turner-v. A parcel of Sugars, decided in the district court of this district in the year 1800, in favout: of the purchasers and affirmed on appeal to the circuit court, the property captured was car-. ried into the Havanna and libelled and ,condemned by a French court sitting at the Cape. The sale also took place prior to the condemnation. It was indeed asserted in that case, as it was in this, that the sale was made with the consent of the captaii, but there was no evidence to prove it. In two im. portant features, these cases are parallel, and I might rest my opinion on thi.s point, on precedent alone ; but it affords me more satisfacuon to be able also, to decide an principle. As. the sale was not made by order of a competent tribunal, and was made by the captors at a time when their rights were not consummated by a judicial decision, the cliimant in this case could have acquired no more thati an inchoate right, subject to be confirmed or defeated by the event of the decision of the court to which the cause was preferred; that is, he acquired no more interest than what was possessed by the captor *from whom he purchased. Had the decision been against the captors with the ev-ideisce now before me, I should not hesitate to decide in favour of restitution ; but when once the decree of condemnation Vas passed, the government of France has made the act of capture its own, and all question. of individualinterst are at an end.
The whole of tfie argument founded on the violation of the treaty, is subje'ct to the general objection, that it leads to a revision of ad~cree of a foreign tribunal
The French courts are bound by the convention with Prance, and it is to" be presumed, that they bear'it in mind in their decisions. They possess the same power. in construing its meaning and effect that we do, and though influenced by an erroneous opinion, that would not of itself vitiate theirdecrees. With regard to the ground of the argument drawn from the 12th article; to .wit, that Port de Paix is the port of an enemy of France, and therefore -a trade with it is sanctioned by that article, Ithink is totally incorrect in point of fact. France has not yet relinquished the contest, and until she does, I think that all the ports of the island are still ports of France, and that she possesses the right to exclude all the world from a commerce with them, and to fix the penalty for a breach of, such exclusion. There is- a peculiarity in the unhappy conflict raging in .that devoted island, which should make us hesitate in applying to it the general rules of war between indej~endent nations. Great Britain, dei.rly interested as she is in embarrassing and dis. tressing her enemy, has not ventured to apply the general iawh of war to this newly erected empirq.. On the contrary, she condemnslour vessels carrying contraband of war "o the brigand ports, as if carrying to the ports of her enemy, although in fact it is carrying them to the most inyeterate enemy of her rival. As the 20th article relates only to the case of a capture for carrying contraband of war to an encnt-'s port, I shall pass ito:ver without

516

APPENDIX.

any observations, and shall close with a few remarks on the 22d aticle, the last noticed in the argument.

The first clause of this article, and the only one relating to this case, is in the following words: " It is further agreed, that in all cases, the established courts for prize causes in the country to which prizes may be conducted, shall take cognisance of them," Sec. It strikes me upon an attentive consideration of this article, that the only object of it was arecognition of the established doctrine, that the courts of the capturing power shall judge of the legality of capture, and to add the very necessary provision that the reasons of condemnation shall be in all cases expressed in their decrees. 'But certainly the words literally taken, will produce the ipference contended -for by counsel, to wit, that vessels captured from our citizens by France, caliot be condemned, except in a French port,-for it would be absurd to suppose that It was itended to give jurisdiction to the courts of any neutral or ally, into whoseports such prizes might be carried. If this -werea just constructiin of
the article alluded tb, it would only follow, thitt a violation of the treaty had
been committed, for which France is bound to niake atonement, and that the
court of admiralty of Santo Domingo was incorrecv in proceeding to adjudi-
cate a vessel not lying in their own port. But I conceive that the validity of
the decree will still remain uhshaken as to the change of'property.

If this article was not brought to the notice of that court, it may well be
attributed to the laches of the libellant himself in not making this defence, or indeed any- other in a court that was open to his claims. But there is a liberAlity and candour necessary in the construction of treaties which would make me reject the one here contended for, were it necessary to decide upon It.' I cnuld never be induced to think that a point of such importance would be left to mere inference, by the able men who negotiated that treaty, when it couid have been so easily expressed, in a single unequivocal sentenqe. Nor do I think the interest of the neutral would be'promoted by a construction which would subjeet the fair trader to the melancholy inconvenience of being detained in some distafit port, until he could be safely conveyed to that of,the captor for adjudication, or he exposed, perhaps, to the perils of the ocean during some tedious voyage for the same purpose.

Upon the whole, I am of opinion that the decrees in these cases qhould be reversed, And the libels be dismissed., But as the claimant purchased before
cdanlem nation, and the libellant -had a fair claim to thit investigationj I am *f opinion that each party should pay his own costs.
