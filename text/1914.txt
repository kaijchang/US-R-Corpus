Syllabus.

235 U. S.

The only doubt open in the present position of the case is whether the ground upon which we hold the contract unenforceable is not a matter of common law, which we may think that the Kansas courts ought to apply but which is not open to review here. The case at first sight seems like those in which a State decides to enforce or not to enforce a domestic contract notwithstanding or because of its tendency to cause a breach of the law of some other State. Graves v. Johnson, 179 Massachusetts, 53, 156 Massachusetts, 211. But the policy involved here is the policy of the United States. It is not a matter that the States can regard or disregard at their will. There can be no question that the United States can make its prohibitions binding upon others than Indians to the extent necessary effectively to carry its policy out, and therefore, as on the grounds that we have indicated the contract contravenes the policy of the law, there is no reason why the law should not be read, if necessary, as broad enough to embrace it in terms.

alleged errors not of a fundamental or jurisdictional character which were not presented to that court for consideration or which were waived expressly or by implication cannot be regarded as before this court. An allowance of commissions to trustees of an estate in the District of Columbia made by the auditor and affirmed by both of the courts of the District will not be disturbed by this court. Barney v. Saunders, 16 How. 535. The decree of the court which has acquired jurisdiction of an estate and settled an account cannot be collaterally attacked; and so held in a case where the will was probated in Massachusetts and the executors accounted but turned over the assets to trustees appointed in the District of Columbia after a finding that testator was not a resident of Massachusetts. Where an account has been verified by oath and duly presented to, examined by, and passed on, by the court, the decree cannot be regarded as one based only on consent and attacked collaterally in the courts of another jurisdiction under the rule that a trustee's consent cannot work to the prejudice of the beneficiaries. A trustee can make no profit out of his trust, and even though the estate is not a loser, and the commissions no more than the services are worth, a trustee may not participate in commissions of his own firm on transactions with the estate. 37 App. D. C. 519, affirmed in part and reversed in part.

THE facts, which involve the rights and duties of trustees of an estate, are stated in the opinion.

Mr. Nathaniel Wilson for appellants: The trustees' failure to account fully in this cause, and the futility of their attempt to diminish their accountability by obtaining the Massachusetts probate decree of April 25, 1899, was not cured by acquiescence. The trustees are accountable for diminishing the estate. The allowance of the probate account concluded nothing except the executors' discharge in Massachusetts. The failure to account is important; the transactions were numerous. The trustees failed to account in this cause for the specific fund of $18,800, which they withdrew from the

trust funds, and then procured to be allowed to the executors by the Massachusetts probate decree of April 25, 1899.
The trustees are accountable for the profits realized by Mr. Drury from sales of notes to the trust estate.
The appellees seek to separate the profits from the dealings with the trust estate.
It is not clear that the trust estate lost nothing.
The performance of the trust imposed upon the trustees by the decree of their appointment is not completed, because the "Eliza C. Magruder trust" remains unexecuted, and the trust property remains in the possession of the trustees.
The allowance of compensation to the trustees was erroneous.
The services were not of a character to merit the amount allowed.
The proportion or percentage of compensation was arbitrary and not based upon any evidence.
The trustees are entitled to no compensation whatever because of the maladministration of the trust.
In support of these contentions, see Barney v. Saunders, 16 How. 535; Bay State Gas Co. v. Rogers, 147 Fed. Rep. 557; Blake v. Pegram, 109 Massachusetts, 541; Findly v. Pertz, 66 Fed.

Argument for Appellees.

The executors' compensation, as claimed and stated, was proper.
The Massachusetts decree was properly treated as conclusive here.
The auditor's refusal to reopen the executors' accounts in Massachusetts or formeraudits in the District of Columbia, was proper.
The allowance of five per cent on principal and ten per cent on increase was proper.
No question of alleged maladministration, as ground for denial of all compensation, is in the record or raised in the court below. The record shows that one of the trustees was more concerned for interests of a friend than for those of his cestui que trust. There was no combination by the trustees and the guardian to control and use the trust estate. There was no diminution of the estate by the trustees.
In support of these contentions, see Abbott v. Bradstreet, 85 Massachusetts (3 Allen), 587; Barney v. Saunders, 16 How. 535, 541, 542; Boone v. Chiles, 10 Pet. 171; Carnealv.

MR. JUSTICE DAY delivered the opinion of the court.

William A. Richardson, for some years before his death Chief Justice of the Court of Claims of the United States, died at Washington, D. C., October 19, 1896. By his last will and testament, dated August 9, 1895, he described himself as "Chief Justice of the Court of Claims at Washington, a citizen and inhabitant of Cambridge, in the County of Middlesex and Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and having property in said County." By his will he appointed his brother George F. Richardson, of Lowell, Massachusetts, and Samuel A. Drury, of Washington, D. C., as executors and trustees. The will was probated in the Probate Court of Middlesex County, Massachusetts, on October 28, 1896. It appears in the record that the deceased had a little real estate in Massachusetts, but the main portion of his estate was, and always had been, in the City of Washington. The probate of the will in Massachusetts. seems to have been in deference to the expression in the will as to his place of residence. Subsequently, and upon certain proceedings being instituted to enforce taxation in Massachusetts of the estate in the hands of the executors, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts held that the actual residence of Mr. Richardson could be inquired into in that proceeding, and upon the facts shown it was in the District of Columbia. Dallingerv. Richardson, 176 Massachusetts, 77. That case grew out of the imposition of personal taxes amounting to seven thousand five hundred dollars annually on the assets of the estate. As this would have nearly exhausted the income of the

Opinion of the Court.

estate and cut off the support of the beneficiaries under the will, a bill for injunction was filed in this case in the Supreme Court of the District by the father in behalf of the present appellants, who were the beneficiaries under the will. An amended bill was subsequently filed, having for its object an injunction against the executors from paying out of the estate any taxes in the State of Massachusetts, it being stated that, notwithstanding the recitals of the will, William A. Richardson's place of residence and last domicile was in the District of Columbia, where the assets and personal securities of the estate were in the keeping of Samuel A. Drury, also a resident of the District of Columbia. In addition to the injunction, the bill prayed an account of the property of the estate which had come into the hands of the executors under the will, and that they might be required to file an account from time to time. Mr. George F. Richardson, one of the executors, being a resident of the State of Massachusetts, and declining to submit to the local jurisdiction, the amended bill' was filed against Samuel A. Drury alone. The answer of Drury stated that he had the custody and control of the assets and personal securities, and expressed his willingness to account in the court or in any other jurisdiction in that behalf for the moneys received by him as executor and trustee. Such proceedings were had that, on April 1, 1899, a decree was made continuing the restraining order theretofore made in the case, and finding that the late William A. Richardson was last domiciled in the District of Columbia, where the beneficiaries lived, and it was ordered and decreed that Samuel A. Drury and Samuel Maddox, both of the District of Columbia, be appointed trustees to perform the trusts created in the will, and, they were "authorized and empowered to receive from the executors named in said will all the property whereof the deceased died seized and possessed, provided, nevertheless, that the said Samuel A. Drury and Samuel Maddox shall first give

separate bonds in the penal sum of Twenty-five thousand dollars, each, with one or more securities to be approved by this Court, conditioned for the faithful discharge of their duties as such trustees." Some five reports were
made by the auditor to whom the matter was referred to take accounts, and various proceedings were had, which are fully set out in the opinion of the Court of Appeals in this case (37 D. C. App. 519). It is enough for our purposes to state that the proceedings resulted in an order of reference to the auditor to state the account of the trustees. This order was made on January 17, 1909. The auditor named having died, a further order of reference was made to another auditor to "state the final account of the trustees and the distribution of the trust estate in their hands, and report such commission or compensation to the trustees as may be appropriate and proper." To this report certain exceptions were filed by the present appellarits. Upon final hearing, a decree was entered by which these exceptions were overruled, and the Court of Appeals sustained this action of the Supreme Court (37 D. C. App. supra). Hence this appeal.
The argument has taken a wide range, and questions are discussed which are not embraced in the exceptions filed to the auditor's report which was the basis of action in the courts below, and in the Court of Appeals that court dealt with only three exceptions, stating that a number of exceptions were entered to the report, and that those relied upon in that court related to the allowance of a five per cent. commissiQn on principal and ten per cent. on income; to the $18,800 item allowed by the Massachusetts court; and to alleged profits made by the trustees in the purchase of notes for reinvestment.
Under the statute in force at the time of this appeal, owing to the amount involved, the decision of the Court of Appeals might be brought by appeal in review before this court. This court therefore sits as an appellate court

for the purpose of reviewing the decree of the Court of Appeals, and that is the extent of the jurisdiction here. Original objections to the auditor's report and the decree of the Supreme Court, not brought forward in the Court of Appeals, cannot be made here. Alleged errors not of a fundamental or jurisdictional character, which were not presented to the appellate court for consideration, and which were waived, either expressly or by implication, will not be regarded as before this court. Montana Railway Co. v. Warren, 137 U. S. 348, 351; Gila Valley Railway Co. v. Hall, 232 U. S. 94, 98; Grant Bros. v. United States, 232 U. S. 647, 660. We shall then consider the assignments of error which were brought to the attention of the District Court of Appeals.
First, as to the allowance to the trustees of five per cent. commission on the principal, and ten per cent. on the income. As to this allowance, the auditor made a lengthy finding of fact, setting forth in detail the services rendered by the trustees over a period of ten years, finding, as to the character of the estate, that the great bulk thereof was second trust notes of small amounts, as to which the auditor says that the transactions were almost innumerable, the total number of notes approximating three thousand, and he sets forth in detail other services involving care of the real estate, looking after the repairs of the property, acquiring parcels of real estate, and the sale thereof, and saying in conclusion that he had no hesitancy in finding that the trustees were well entitled to the commissions allowed. This allowance met with the approval of both the District Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals, and seems to have the sanction of an earlier decision of this court, where it was said that such allowances were customary in Maryland and the District of Columbia. Barney v. Saunders, 16 How. 535, 542. We are not therefore prepared to disturb the decree of the courts below in this respect.

The next exception involves the allowance of the item of $18,800.00 in the Probate Court of Massachusetts, and charging the trustees with the balance of the estate after that 'allowance had been made. It appears that the executors Richardson and Drury appeared on April 4, 1899, in the Massachusetts Probate Court and by petition set forth that they had been appointed and had given bond and due notice of their appointment as executors of the will of William A. Richardson; that there was not at the time of the grants of the letters testamentary, and had not been since, property belonging to the testator in. the Commonwealth of Massachusetts; that since the granting of letters testamentary Isabel Magruder, the only surviving child and heir at law of the said testator had deceased, and that under and by the terms and provisions of said will it was provided that upon her decease the property of the testator should be held by the executors of. said will f6r the benefit of the two minor children' surviving the said daughter, namely, Alexander Richardson Magruder, of the age of sixteen years, and Isabel Richardson Magruder, of the age of about thirteen years; that these children who were interested as beneficiaries in the trusts created by the will, at the time of the probate thereof.and ever since had resided at Washington, in the District of Columbia; that Samuel Maddox and Samuel A. Drury had been appointed by the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia trustees for said minors, to carry out the provisions of said will in behalf of the said minors,
aid that Alexander F. Magruder had been appointed guardian of said minors; and they further represented to the court that William A. Richardson was not at the time of his decease a resident of Massachusetts, but of the District of Columbia, and that all the parties in interest under the will, 'at the time of the probate thereof, lived in Washington, as they had since and did then. 'They represented that the will should have been probated

at Washington, in the District of Columbia, but either by accident or mistake, probate in the Probate Court of Middlesex County, Massachusetts, was had, and they asked an order that they be au thorized to pay over the trust funds to the trustees appointed by the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, and that upon the payment of such funds to such trustees they be discharged from further liability.
A decree was entered in the Probate Court of Massachusetts on April 11, 1899, wherein it was found that by the decree of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, dated April 1, 1899, Samuel Maddox and Samuel A. Drury had been duly appointed trustees to perform the trusts of the will, and that the beneficiaries were residents of Washington, and that the guardian of the minors had signified his consent to the granting of the petition, and that the laws of the District of Columbia secured the performance of the trusts, and Richardson and Drury as executors, were authorized to pay over the trust funds to Maddox and Drury, as trustees. On April 25, 1899, in the same Probate Court, Richardson and Drury, as executors, filed their first and final account, in which they charged themselves with property in the aggregate of $415,458.37, and asked to be allowed sundry payments and charges. This account was endorsed with a request for its allowance, signed by Alexander R. Magruder and Isabel R. Magruder, by their guardian, Alexander F. Magruder, and by Maddox and Drury, as trustees. On April 25, the Probate Court made the following order: "The foregoing account having been presented for allow-
ance, and verified by the oath of the accountant, and all persons interested having consented thereto in writing, and no objection being made thereto., and the same having been examined and considered by the court: it is decreed that said account be allowed." The schedules attached show the property and the payments, charges, losses and

distributions, among others the item of $18,800.00, to

which exception is made. This item states: "Expense of

administration, including care of property, the payment

of debts, the making of final account, the collection of

notes amounting to $226,607.54, the investment in trust

notes of $166,958.21, the collection from interest and

other sources of $58,168.94, the payment of about $50,000

for repairs on real estate, the taking up of prior mortgages,

taxes, etc., including also the payment of moneys to

Isabel Magruder and to Alexander F. Magruder, the

guardian of their minor children, counsel fees incurred in

the defense of suits for taxes in Massachusetts and for

.counsel fees in Washington, etc.,

$18,800.00."

The auditor held that he had no authority to disregard

or change this item of credit; that the same had been in-

cluded in the reports of his predecessors and confirmed

by the court; and that the allowance, having been made

in the ,Probate Court of Massachusetts, was not open to

review.

The Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, in

the course of its opinion in this case, states that the ap-

pellants contended that there was no jurisdiction in the

Probate Court of Massachusetts to probate the will, a

position which counsel for the appellant in this case dis-

claims in his brief fil6d herein, and says that the conten-

tion is that the order and decree in Massachusetts was

not intended to be operative to diminish the accountability

of the executors and trustees to the District of Columbia

court. But we do not so interpret the proceedings. The

account was filed in the Massachusetts court; and, the

record recites, was examined and considered by the court

and duly allowed. This order, read in connection with

the rules of the Massachusetts court set out at the head

of the account, stating the authority of the court to allow

reasonable expenses and compensation, shows that it

was the intention of the Probate Court to make an

Opinion of the Court.

allowance including such expenses and compensation. Apart from the concession of the jurisdiction here made, we have no doubt that the Massachusetts court, on the presentation of the will, had the right to determine its jurisdiction to receive and probate the same, and upon ordering the property turned o'ver to. the trustees appointed in the District of Columbia, to settle the account and fix the compensation of the executors and order the balance turned over to the trustees. True, the Massachusetts court held, in the case of Dallingerv. Richardson, 176 Massachusetts, 77, supra, that Richardson was not a resident of Massachusetts. In the course of the opinion in that case, the court points out that, for the purpose of the tax question, the matter of residence was not foreclosed by the adjudication of the Probate Court, whether in accordance with the truth or not.
It is well settled that the decree of the court which has acquired jurisdiction of an estate and settled an account cannot be collaterally attacked, Jenison v. Hapgood, 7 Pickering 1, 7. In that case it was held that what assets came into the executor's hands, what debts he had paid, and so of every matter properly done or cognizable in the Probate Court, the judgment of that court is conclusive. See also Abbott v. Bradstreet, 3 Allen, 587. There was no attempt to probate the will in the District of Columbia, in which event the fincing of the fact of domicile in the proceedings in Massachusetts would not have been conclusive here. Overby v. Gordon, 177 U. S. 214. The trustees were authorized to receive the assets from the
executors. The Probate Court in Massachusetts, and no other court, had, authority to settle the executors' accounts and determine their compensation. Vaughan v. Northup, 15 Pet. 1. We cannot agree with counsel for the appellant that the order of the Probate Court was based upon consent only, and that this is a case for the application of the rule that the trustees' consent to such a decree

cannot work to the prejudice of the beneficiaries of the trust. Whether the guardian might give such consent, we do not find it necessary to decide, for the decree shows that the account was presented, verified by the oath of the accountants, and that it was examined and considered
by the court. The next exception involves the allowance of commis-
sions on the notes purchased from Mr. Drury's firm. The contention before the auditor was that one trustee had received compensation in connection with the handling of these investments, and that that should be taken into account. As to this exception, the auditor finds that "the fact clearly appears from the testimony that Arms & Drury as real estate brokers, made loans on trust notes, upon which loans they were paid by the borrowers a commission ranging from one to two per cent., according to the circumstances of the case, many- being building loans; that subsequently as notes of the trust estate were paid off Mr. Drury would reinvest the monies of the estate in trust notes held by Arms & Drury, paying the face value and accrued interest on the notes so purchased." As a matter of law, the auditor concluded: "No profit was made by the firm of Arms & Drury on the sales of the notes to the trustees. . . . The transactions of Arms & Drury with the trustees were in the regular course of their business, in which they had their own monies invested. They cost the estate not a penny more than if the transactions had been with some other firm or individual. If the firm of Arms & Drury, out of their own monies, made loans on promissory notes, upon which loans were paid by the borrower the customary brokerages, those were profits on their own funds, in which this estate could have no interest, and in which it could acquire no interest by reason of the subsequent purchase of those notes by the trustees for their real value, any more than could any of the purchasers of such notes from Arms & Drury claim such an

MAGRUDER v. DRURY.

Opinion of the Court.

interest. No charge of malfeasance or misfeasance is made against the trustees or that by reason of these transactions the trustees benefited in any manner out of the money of this estate. On the contrary, the relation of the firm of Arms & Drury to Drury and Maddox, trustees, benefited
the estate, by enabling the trustees at all times to make immediate re-investment of its funds, without loss of income, and by enabling the trustees to at all times readily procure re-investments without payment of brokerage, a brokerage not uncommonly charged the lender for placing his money, as well as the borrower for procuring his loan in times of stringency. The application of the well known rule in equity should rather, therefore, be in favor of the trustees than against them with respect to these transactions. The objection narrows itself to a claim that Drury by reason of his position as trustee, should in addition to the benefit of his valuable services, commercial knowledge, and business acumen, make the estate a gift of profits on his individual monies, to which the estate is in no wise entitled, and to which it could not make a semblance of reasonable claim, had the trustees been other than Drury or the agents of the estate been other than Arms and Drury." This view seems to have met with the approval of the Supreme Court, and a like view was taken by the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, (37 D. C. App. 519,
supra). It is a well settled rule that a trustee can make no profit
out of his trust. The rule in such cases springs from his duty to protect the interests of the estate, and not to permit his personal interest to in any wise conflict with his duty in that respect. The intention is to provide against any possible selfish interest exercising an influence which can interfere with the faithful discharge of the duty which is owing in a fiduciary capacity. "It therefore prohibits a party from purchasing on his own account that which his duty or trust requires him to sell on account of another,

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.

Opinion of the Court.

235 U. 'S.

and from purchasing on account of another that which he sells on his own account. In effect, he is not allowed to unite the two opposite characters of buyer and seller, because his interests, when he is the seller or buyer on his own account, are directly conflicting with those of the person on whose account he buys or sells." Michoud v. Girod, 4 How. 503, 555.
It makes no difference that the estate was not a loser in the transaction or that the commission was no more than the services were reasonably worth. It is the relation of the trustee to the estate which prevents his dealing in such way as to make a personal profit for himself. The findings show that the firm of which Mr. Drury was a member, in making the loans evidenced by these notes, was allowed a commission of one to two per cent. This profit was in fact realized when the notes were turned over to the estate at face value and accrued interest. The value of the notes when they were turned over depended on the responsibility and security back of them. When the notes were sold to the estate it took the risk of payment without loss. While no wrong was intended, and none was in fact done to the estate, we think nevertheless that upon the principles governing the duty of a trustee, the contention that this
profit could not be taken by Mr. Drury owing to his relation to the estate, should have been sustained.
We find no other error in the proceedings of the Court of Appeals, but for the reason last stated, its decision must be reversed, and the cause remanded to that court with directions to remand the cause to the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.
Reversed.

235 U. S.

CERTIFICATE FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT.

No. 78. Argued November 12, 1914.-Decided January 5, 1915.
Where a resident citizen of Georgia has been duly adjudicated a bankrupt and dies after such adjudication and after the appointment, qualification and partial administration of the trustee, the estate vested in the trustee under § 70 of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 is chargeable under § 8 of that law with the allowance for a year's support of the widow and minor children as provided by § 4041 of the Georgia Code.
The Bankruptcy Act of 1898 makes no exception to the rule that after proceedings have been commenced they are not to be abated by death of the bankrupt; and, under the proviso in § 8, the right of the widow and children in case of such death to an allowance out of what remains in the hands of the trustee, is as broad as the prohibition against abatement.
What the court may do.pending the life of the bankrupt is binding on the bankrupt; and, as to such property as has been distributed prior to his death, the right of the widow and children to charge it with support under a state statute is defeated. Such allowance can only be made out of property remaining in the hands of the trustee on an order duly made in proceedings in which he, as representative of the creditors, has a right to be heard.
THE facts, which involve the construction of §§ 8 and 70 of the Bankruptcy Law of 1898 and § 4041 of the Georgia Code in regard to the allowance to be made for a year's support of the widow and children of a bankrupt dying during administration of the estate, are stated in the opinion.

HULL v. DICKS.

235 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE LAMAR delivered the opinion of the court.

In January, 1912, L. K. Didks, a citizen and resident of Richmond County, Georgia, was adjudicated a bankrupt. James M. Hull, Jr., was elected Trustee. and on February 5, 1912, took possession of all of the property of the bankrupt. Three weeks later L. K. Dicks died leaving a widow and four minor children. Thereafter the widow applied to the Court of Ordinary for the year's support to which the family was entitled by virtue of the provision in the Georgia Code (§ 4041) that "upon the death of any person . . . leaving an estate, solvent or insolvent . . it shall be the duty of the Ordinary . . . . to appoint . . appraisers, to set apart and assign to such widow and children either in property or money, a sufficiency from the estate for their support and maintenance for the space of twelve
months." Citation issued and thereafter the Ordinary duly set
apart to the family a year's support to be made out of the estate of L. K. Dicks in the hands of the Trustee in Bankruptcy. The widow subsequently applied to the Referee for an order directing the Trustee to pay over the amount so set apart. Her application was denied and that ruling was reversed by the District Court. (198 Fed. Rep. 293.) The Trustee took the case to the Circuit Court of Appeals which certified to this court the following question:
"Where a resident citizen of Georgia has been duly adjudicated a bankrupt and dies after such adjudication and after the appointment, qualification and partial administration of the trustee, is the estate vested in the trustee under § 70 of the Bankruptcy Law of 1898 chargeable under § 8 of the same law, or otherwise, with the allowance for a year's support of the widow and minor children, as provided in the laws of Georgia?"

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.

Opinion of the Court.

235 U. S.

Counsel for the appellant contends that this question should be answered in the negative. He insists that § 8 1 of the Bankruptcy Act of July 1, 1898, c. 541, 30 Stat. 544, 549, does not create a right but, as in this case, merely preserves the right, given by the state law, to have a year's support "out of the estate" left by the husband and father. It was then argued that as the title to the property had vested in the Trustee before the death of the bankrupt, Dicks did not die "leaving an estate" and there was, therefore, no estate out of which, under the Code of Georgia, the year's support could be set
apart. This reasoning would be applicable if the widow and
children were asserting rights of inheritance under the Statute of Distribution. Moreover, there would be no answer 'to the argument advanced if the title, which vested in the Trustee, was in its nature like that which would have been acquired if Dicks in his lifetime had made a Deed of Assignment to the Trustee. But such is not the case. For construing the statute as a whole it will be seen that while § 70 2 (30 Stat. 565) of the Bankruptcy Act vested title in the Trustee primarily for the benefit of the creditors, there was an exception in favor of the bankrupt himself, and the transfer was also subject
to a condition in favor of his family if he died before the

proceedings ended. If the Bankrupt elected to claim a homestead the exempt property, even though it had passed to the Trustee, would, after identification and appraisal, be turned back into his possession. Chicago &c. R. R. v. Hall, 229 U. S.511, 515. The Trustee's title was also subject to the condition that if the bankrupt died during the pendency of the proceedings, the widow and children would be entitled to receive the allowance given them by the laws of the State of his residence. This latter limitation on the Trustee's title was in connection with legislation on the subject of abatement.
For the statute seems tb assume that, in the absence of a statutory provision to the contrary, the death of the bankrupt would have abated the proceedings. In that event the property, although the title thereto had been previously vested in the Trustee, would have been surrendered to the bankrupt's personal representatives, who would then have been in possession of an estate, out of which, under the Georgia Code, a year's support could have been set apart to the widow and children. Congress need not have made any change in the general law but, as in the act of August 19, 1841, c. 9, 5 Stat. 440, could have allowed the suit to abate on the death of the bankrupt; Or, as in the act of March 2, 1867, c. 176, 14 Stat. 517, 522, § 12, itc.ould have permitted without requiring, an abatement; Or, as in the act of April 4, 1800, c. 19, 2 Stat. 19, 27, § 19, it could have made a mandatory provision that the proceedings should continue if the bankrupt died "after commission sued out;" Or, it could have legislated, as in § 8 of the present statute (30 Stat. 549, § 8) where Congress went further than in any of the previous bankruptcy laws and made a universal and mandatory provision that "the death . . . of a bankrupt shall not abate the proceedings." That sweeping declaration, however, was coupled with the Proviso that "in case of death the widow and children shall be entitled to all

235 U. S.

rights of dower and allowance fixed by the laws of the
State of the bankrupt's residence." Section 8 with these two clauses prevents, on the one
hand, the loss and inconvenience to creditors resulting from an abatement,-while at the same time avoiding the hardship., of depriving the widow and minor children of a right to which they would have been entitled, if the suit had abated on the death of the husband and father. The statute makes no exception 'or qualification-after the proceedings have been commenced they are not to be abated by death. And the Proviso clearly indicates an intention to make the preservhtion of the widow and children's right to the allowance as broad as the prohibition against the abatement of the suit. Inasmuch as the proceedings did not abate if the death of the bankrupt occurred after filing the petition and before the election of the Trustee, neither Was the right to the allowance lost if the bankrupt died after such election and at a stage of the proceedings where the title had, by operation of law, vested in the Trustee. For such title, whenever it accrued, was subject to the condition that the assets, in the hands of the Trustee, should be charged with the payment of the allowance to which on the death of the bankrupt, the widow and children were entitled under the laws of the State of his residence.
It is claimed that, under this interpretation, if the bankrupt died after the Trustee had wholly or partially administered the estate the widow and children could still enforce their rights to a year's support out of the bankrupt estate, even if the property had passed into the hands of purchasers. But this loses sight of the fact that the family had nothing in the nature of a lien which, during his lifetime, prevented the bankrupt or the Trustee from disposing of his property. What was done by the court, while the bankrupt was in life and a party to the proceeding, was binding upon him, and therefore as effectual

to defeat the right to a year's support out of such property as if the sale and distribution had been made by the bankrupt himself or by his duly authorized agent.
The right to the year's support accrued at the date of the bankrupt's death and could be enforced out of property remaining in the hands of the Trustee,-and then only after the allowance had been duly made in proceedings, where he, as representative of the creditors, had the right to be heard.
There has been some conflict in the decisions dealing
with the subject [In re McKenzie, 142 Fed. Rep. 383, 384 (6); In re Slack, 111 Fed. Rep. 523; In re Newton, 122 Fed. Rep. 103; In re Seabolt, 113 Fed. Rep. 766, 767; In re Parschen, 119 Fed.

UNITED STATES v. JONES, ADMINISTRATOR.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No. 450. Argued December 9, 1914.-Decided January 25, 1915.
The tax imposed by the War Revenue Act of 1898 was purely a succession tax. It was not laid upon the entire estate, but was a charge upon the transmission of personal property from a deceased owner to legatees or distributees.
Personal property does not pass directly from a decedent to legatees or distributees, but goes primarily to the executor or administrator who passes to them the residue after settlement of the estate.
Until in due course of the administration of an estate it has been ascertained that a surplus remains, it cannot be said that the legatees or distributees are certainly entitled to receive or enjoy any part of the property; and so held as to an estate of one dying prior to July 1, 1902, that until such fact was ascertained the interests of legatees and distributees were not absolute, but were contingent within the meaning of § 29 of the War Revenue Act of 1898 and of § 3 of the Refunding Act of June 27, 1902. Vanderbilt v. Eidman, 196 U. S. 480; Hertz v. Woodman, 218 U. S. 205, distinguished.

beneficial interest, but, on the contrary, was subject to the tax, having vested prior to July 1, 1902.
As held in Knowlton v. Moore, 178 U. S. 41., 56, the thing taxed is the power to transmit or the transmission from the dead to the living. See Hertz v. Woodman, supra.
A legacy to pay over the net income from a fund in periodical payments during the life of the legatee is not a contingent beneficial interest, but a vested life estate, the income from which as determined by the mortuary tables and an interest rate of 4 per cent was subject to the tax. United States v. Fidelity Trust Co., 222 U. S. 158.
The tax accrued when the testator died on June 28, 1902, although her personal estate was not distributed to her two children until May, 1903, and the tax was not collected until October 24, 1905.
Appellee contends, and the court below sustained his contention, that under a Pennsylvania statute providing that no administrator shall be compelled to make distribution of the goods of an intestate until one year be fully expired from the granting of the administration of the estate, act of Feb. 24, 1834, § 38, P. L., 80 Purd. 447, the administrator had exclusive possession of the personal property up to and subsequent to July 1, 1902, and that
therefore no tax had accrued on the several estates, they being contingent beneficial interests at the time of the repeal; but this cannot be sustained. Beer v. Moffat, 209 Fed. Rep. 779; Baldwin v. Eidman, 202 Fed. Rep. 968; United States v. Fidelity Trust Co., 222 U. S. 158. Hertz v. Woodman, 218 U. S. 205; cannot be distinguished. Farrell v. United States, 167 Fed. Rep. 639, does not apply.
As the thing taxed was the right of succession, which occurred upon the death of the intestate prior to July 1, 1902, the distributive shares .of the two legatees became vested within the meaning of the act of June 13, 1898, at the moment of her death and subject to taxation regard-

less of the fact that the administrator, under the state law, had the right to retain possession of the legacies for a period extending beyond July 1, 1902.

Mr. Barry Mohun for appellee: The court has jurisdiction. The moneys paid by claimant as taxes upon the distributive shares of the Dalzell estate are refundable under the terms of and directions contained in the refunding act of June 27, 1902. Under the terms of the taxing statute, amendments thereof, the repealing act and the refunding act, as construed by this and other Federal courts, the criterion of liability for taxation of legacies and distributive shares of estates of persons who died during the period the taxing statute and amendments were in force, was whether such beneficial interests were, during that time, absolutely vested in possession or enjoyment of the legatees or next of kin. In the absence of such possession or enjoyment all taxes collected upon such beneficial interests are directed to be returned by the refunding act. The distributive shares of this estate were not absolutely vested in possession of the distributees prior to July 1, 1902; hence the taxes collected thereon are refundable. An examination of the history of the times discloses a fixed purpose on the part of Congress to prohibit the collection of taxes upon all interests unless the right of absolute possession or enjoyment existed prior to July 1, 1902, and if collected to direct their refundment.

MR. JUSTICE VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion 'of the court.

This is a suit to recover a succession tax paid under §§ 29 and 30 of the act of June 13, 1898, c. 448, 30 Stat. 448, 464. The facts are these: Adelaide P. DalzeU, a

Opinion of the Court.

resident of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, died intestate June 28, 1902, leaving personal property of considerable value, and being survived by two daughters as her only next of kin. July 14, 1902, an administrator was appointed and the property was committed to his charge for the purposes of administration. Under the local law the
debts of the intestate and the expenses of administration were to be paid out of the property and what remained was to be distributed in equal shares between the two daughters, but distribution could not be made for several months after the appointment of the administrator. In regular course the debts and expenses were ascertained and paid, and this left for distribution property of the value of $219,341.74. The Collector of Internal Revenue then collected from the administrator, without protest from him, a succession tax of $3,290.12 upon the distributive shares of the daughters, and the tax was covered into the Treasury. About seven months after paying the tax the administrator sought, in the mode prescribed, to have it refunded under § 3 of the Act of June 27, 1902, c. 1160, 32 Stat. 406, but the Secretary of the Treasury denied the application. The administrator then brought this suit and the Court of Claims gave judgment in his favor. 49 Ct. Cls. 408. A reversal of the judgment is sought by the United States.
By § 29 of the act of 1898 an executor, administrator or trustee having in charge any legacy or distributive share arising from personal property, and passing from a decedent to another by will. or intestate laws, was subjected to a tax graduated according to the value of the beneficiary's interest in the property and the degree of his kinship to the decedent. Interests which were contingent and uncertain were not affected, but only those whereof the beneficiary had become invested with a present right of possession or enjoyment. Vanderbilt v. Eidman, 196 U. S. 480, 491-495, 498. Section 29 was

repealed April 12, 1902, but the repeal was not to take effect until July 1, 1902, and was not to prevent the collection of any tax imposed prior to that date. 32 Stat. 96, c. 500, §§ 7, 8, 11.
As before indicated, the claimant principally relies upon § 3 of the act of June 27, 1902i supra. It reads as follows:
"That in all cases where an executor, administrator, or trustee shall have paid, or shall hereafter pay, any tax upon any legacy or distributive share of personal property under the provisions of the act approved June thirteenth, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, entitled 'An act to provide ways and means to meet war expenditures, and for other purposes,' and amendments thereof, the Secretary of the Treasury be, and he is hereby, authorized and directed to refund, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, upon proper application being made to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, under such rules and regulations as may be prescribed, so much of said tax as may have been collected on contingent beneficial interests which shall not have become vested prior to July first, nineteen hundred and two. And no tax shall hereafter be assessed or imposed under said act approved June thirteenth, eighteen hundred and ninetyeight, upon or in respect of any contingent beneficial interest which shall not become absolutely vested in possession or enjoyment prior to said July first, nineteen hundred and two."
In construing this section this court said in Vanderbilt v. Eidman, supra (p. 500):
"It is, we think, incontrovertible that the taxes which the third section of the act of 1902 directs to be refunded and those which it forbids the collection of in the future are one and the same in their nature. Any other view would destroy the unity of the section and cause its provisions to produce inexplicable conflict. From this it results that

UNITED STATES v. JONES.

236 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

the taxes which are directed in the first sentence to be refunded, because they had been wrongfldly collected on contingent beneficial interests which had not become vested prior to July 1, 1902, were taxes levied on such beneficial interests as had not become vested in possession or enjoyment prior to the date named, within the intendment of the subsequent sentence. In other words, the statute provided for the refunding of taxes collected under the circumstances stated and at the same time forbade like collections in the future."
This view was repeated in United States v. Fidelity Trust Co., 222 U. S. 158.
The decisive question, therefore, in the present case is whether the beneficial interests of the daughters, upon which the tax was collected, had become absolutely vested in possession or enjoyment prior to July 1, 1902, or were at that time contingent. If they had become so vested, the effort to recover the tax must fail; but, if they were contingent, the tax must be refunded. Recognizing that this is so, counsel for the United States insists that the distributive interests to which the daughters succeeded
became vested in the full sense of the statute the moment the intestate died, which was three days before July 1,' 1902. The court below rejected this contention and held that those interests did not become so vested until the daughters were entitled to receive their respective shares in the property remaining after the debts and expenses were paid, which was not until several months after July 1, 1902.
The question should, of course, be determined with due regard to the situation to which the refunding statute was addressed.
The tax imposed by the act of 1898 was purely a succession tax, a charge upon the transmission of personal prop-
erty from a deceased owner to legatees or distributees. It was not laid upon the entire personal estate or upon all

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.

Opinion of the Court.

236 U. S.

that came into the hands of the executor or administrator, but upon "any legacies or distributive shares" in his charge "arising from" such estate and passing to others by will or intestate laws.
It hardly needs statement that personal property does not pass directly from a decedent to legatees or distributees, but goes primarily to the executor or administrator, who is to apply it, so far as may be necessary, in paying debts of the deceased and expenses of administration, and is then to pass the residue, if any, to legatees or distributees. If the estate proves insolvent nothing is to pass to them. So, in a practical sense their interests are contingent and uncertain until, in due course of administration, it is ascertained that a surplus remains after the debts and expenses are paid. Until that is done, it properly cannot be said that legatees or distributees are certainly entitled to receive or enjoy any part of the property. The only right which can be said to vest in them at the time of the death is a right to demand and receive at some time in the future whatever may remain after paying the debts and expenses. But that this right was not intended to be taxed before there was an ascertained surplus or residue to which it could attach is inferable from the taxing act as a whole and especially from the provision whereby the rate of tax was made to depend upon the value of the legacy or distributive share.
True, by that act, the executor or administrator was required, before surrendering a legacy or distributive share to whoever was entitled to it, to pay the tax assessed thereon and to deduct the amount from the particular legacy or distributive share, but this did not mean that the tax was to be assessed or paid in the absence of a right to immediate possession or enjoyment. On the contrary, as was held in Vanderbilt v. Eidman, supra, p. 499, it imported the existence of "a practically contemporaneous right to receive the legacy or distributive share." In that

UNITED STATES v. JONES.

Opinion of the Court.

case it was said, after separately considering the several parts of the act (p. 495): "In view of the express provisions of the statute as to possession or enjoyment and beneficial interest and clear value, and of the absepce of any express language exhibiting an intention to tax a mere technically vested interest in a case where the right to possession or enjoyment was subordinated to an uncertain contingency, it would, we think, be doing violence to the statute to construe it as taxing such an interest before the period when possession or enjoyment had attached."
The actual enforcement of the taxing act by the administrative officers was not uniform as respects contingent interests. At first the tax was regarded as not reaching them until they became absolute, but afterwards it came to be treated as imposing the tax at the time of the death.
The provisions of the repealing act of April 12, 1902, were such that the tax was to be discontinued on July 1 of that year, but without affecting its collection where the right to it became fixed before that time.
Bearing in mind that this was the situation in which § 3 of the act of June 27, 1902, before quoted, was enacted, we think its meaning and purpose are plain. Briefly stated, it deals with legacies and distributive shares upon the same plane, treats both as "contingent" interests until they "become absolutely vested in possession or enjoyment," directs that the tax collected upon Contingent interests not so vested prior to July 1, 1902, shall be refunded, and forbids any further enforcement of the tax as respects interests remaining contingent up to that date. In other words, it recognizes that the tax was being improperly collected upon legacies and distributive shares which were not absolutely vested in possession or enjoyment; and, for the purpose of avoiding the injustice that otherwise might result from this, it requires that the tax be refunded in all instances where the interests upon which it was collected had not become absolutely vested in the
VOL. ccxxxv-8

236 U. S.

sense indicated before July 1, 1902, that being the time when the tax was discontinued,
Applying this statute to the facts before stated, we see no escape from the conclusion that the tax in question must be refunded. It was collected upon distributive shares which neither were nor could have been absolutely vested in possession or enjoyment prior to July 1, 1902. The intestate's death had occurred only three days before, no administrator had been appointed, the debts and expenses had not been ascertained, what, if anything, would remain after their payment was uncertain, and the time had not come when the daughters were entitled to a distribution.
The case of Hertz v. Woodman, 218 U. S. 205, is cited as making for a different conclusion, but it is without real bearing here. The refunding statute was not there in question and was not mentioned in the opinion. The case came to this court upon a certificate from the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, the question certified being (p. 210): "Does the fact that the testator dies within one year immediately prior to the taking effect of the repealing act of April 12, 1902, relieve from taxation legacies otherwise taxable under §§ 29 and 30 of the act of June 13, 1898, as amended by the act of March 2, 1901?" Thus it was expressly stated that the legacies were otherwise taxable and the question propounded was merely whether they were relieved from taxation by the fact that the testator died within one year of July 1, 1902, when the repealing act took effect. The inquiry was prompted by the provision in the amendatory act of March 2, 1901, c. 806, 31 Stat. 938, 948, that the tax should be due and payable one year after the death. The answer was in the negative, it being held that the time when the tax was made due and payable was not determinative of when it was imposed. The opinion contains some language, which, separately considered, gives color to the present

contention of the Government, but this must be read in the light of the question presented for decision and be taken as restrained accordingly. Besides, the opinion approvingly refers (p. 219) to Vanderbilt v. Eidman, supra, as having "conclusively decided" that the tax "does not attach to legacies or distributive shares until the right of succession becomes an absolute right of immediate possession or enjoyment." Here, as we have said, there was no right of immediate possession or enjoyment at the time designated in the refunding statute.

United States courts by virtue of their general equity powers have jurisdiction to enjoin the enforcement of a judgment obtained by fraud or without service.
In the absence of service of process, a person named as defendant can no more be regarded as a party than any other member of the community.
A judgment against a person on whom no process has been served is not erroneous and voidable, but, upon principles of natural justice, and also under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, is absolutely void.
Jurisdiction of the United States courts cannot be lessened or increased by state statutes regulating venue or establishing rules of procedure.
While § 720, Rev. Stat., prohibits United States courts from staying proceedings in a state court, it does not prevent them from depriving a party of the fruits of a fraudulent judgment, nor from enjoining a party from using that which he calls a judgment but which is, in

Statement of the Case.

245 U. S.

Under § 294, Judicial Code, which is the statutory rule for construing that Code, the slight changes between the wording of the act Of 1887 and that of §24, Judicial Code, in regard to jurisdiction bf the Federal court of siuits by assignees was not intended to bring about any change in the law but merely the continuation of the existing statute.
Federal Statutes have always permitted the vendee or assignee to sue in the United States courts to recover property or an interest in property when the requisite value and diversity of citizenship existed. Barney v. Baltimore, 6 Wall. 280.
Section 24, Judicial Code, does not deprive the District Court of jurisdiction to enforce an interest under an assignment by the cestui que trust of an interest in the estate to which the latter has a fixed right in the future. Such an assignment is not a chose in action payable to the assignee within the prohibition of § 24, but an evidence' of the assignee's right, title and estate in the property.
CONRAD BRAKER, JR., of New York, died testate July 21, 1890. The fifteenth item of his will provided that the sum of $50,000 should be held in trust and securely invested for the use of his son, Conrad Morris Braker, who was to re-
ceive the income until he attained the age of fifty-five, when the "principal should be paid to him and belong to him absolutely." If he failed to reach that age the prop-
erty was to be held 'for the benefit of his wife for life with remainder to Henry Braker.
The sixteenth item directed that" one-half of all the rest, residue and remainder, both real and personal," of his estate 'should be held in trust for the use and benefit of Conrad Morris Braker, who was to receive the interest derived from said trust, until he attained the age of fiftyfive when "the whole amount, less $25,000, shall be paid and belong to him absolutely." If he failed to reach that age then the property was to pass to another son.
The amount realized from the residuum, described in the
sixteenth item, aggregated $120,000, and with the $50,000 described in the fifteenth item of the will, was invested in property (not described) which is now held by Austin B. Fletcher, the duly appointed Testamentary Trustee.

On February 25, 1902, Conrad Morris Braker executed an instrument in which, subject to the assignment of $35,000 above referred to, he "granted, bargained, sold, assigned, transferred and set over to the New York Finance Company all of his estate, right, title and interest of any kind, form or description whatsoever to the amount or extent of $35,000 in and to the legacy of $50,000, and also in and to a legacy of the part or share of the residuary estate to which he was entitled under and by virtue of the fifteenth and sixteenth paragraphs of the will of Conrad Braker, Jr., deceased."
By virtue of these two transfers the New York Finance Company claimed to be the owner of such interest in the fund or estates created under the fifteenth and sixteenth items of the will.
The Finance Company thereafter made a note for $15,000, payable to William Brewster Wood, and secured the same by a transfer of its interests under the sixteenth item. It also made another note for $10,000 to Brown, and Schermerhorn, Trustee for Clara Schermerhorn, and secured the same by a transfer of its interest under the fifteenth item.
These notes were not paid when they fell due and the New York Finance Company's equity of redemption was acquired by the respective holders of the two notes. In February, 1913, when Conrad, Morris Braker attained the age of fifty-five, the respective holders of the notes and assignments demanded that the Trustee should pay over to them that to which they were entitled' by virtue of the instruments aforesaid. The. Trustee refused to comply and thereupon the Executors of Wood and the

Trustees of Clara Schermerhorn (all of whom were citizens and residents of Pennsylvania) brought suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Fletcher, Trustee, and Conrad Morris Braker, beneficiary, both being citizens and residents of New York.
The two Bills were each prepared by the same counsel and were identical except that the Trustees of Schermerhorn sued for what had been assigned them under the fifteenth item. The Executors of Wood sued for the interest assigned them in the money or property mentioned in the fifteenth and sixteenth items of the will. In both suits it was alleged that the Complainants had acquired title by virtue of the sale, transfer and assignment executed by Conrad Morris Braker, and subsequent mesne conveyance. It was alleged that Complainants had been informed that he claimed the transfers signed by him to be void because made to secure usurious debts. Both Bills prayed that Braker should be enjoined from litigating the question of title in any other court; that the complainants' right under the assignments should be established by final decree, and that Fletcher, 'the Testamentary Trustee, should be ordered to pay over to the complainants what was due them by virtue of the respective assignments from Braker.
The court dismissed both bills and in each case gave a certificate that the order was based "solely on the ground that no jurisdiction of the District Court existed."
From that. order the complainants appealed to this court.

Mr. Charles H. Burr, with whom Mr. Frederic W. Frost, Mr. Perry D. Trafford and Mr. H. Gordon McCouch were on the brief, for appellants:
The interpretation placed upon the provisions of § 629, Rev. Stat. (now § 24, 1st subd. Jud. Code) by this court in Ingersoll v.. Coram, 211 U. S. 335, is decisive of the jurisdictional questions in this case.

Argument for Appellees.

An interest in a distributive share of an estate (a fortiori in a trust fund) is not within the statute.
The prohibition is against suits by "an assignee" and neither an administrator nor an executor are regarded as
assignees within the statute. In support of these contentions see Ambler v. Eppinger,
137 U. S. 480; Bertha Zinc & Mineral Co. v. Vaughan, 88 Fed. Rep. 566; Brown V. Fletcher, 206 Fed. Rep. 461; Bushnell v. Kennedy, 9 Wall. 387; Chappedelaine v. Dechenaux, 4 Cr. 308; Coal Company v.

Mr. William P. S. Melvin, with whom Mr. Safford A. Crummey was on the brief, for appellees:
The present statute fixing the jurisdiction of District Courts is unqualified in its expression that they cannot take cognizance of a suit to recover upon a chose in action in favor of any assignee unless such suit might have been prosecuted in the court if no assignment had been made. See § 24, Jud. Code, 1st subd.; § 11, Judiciary Act, 1789, 1 Stat. 78; Act of March 3, 1887; Act of August 13, 1888; Sere v. Pitot, 6 Cr. 335; Corbin v. Black Hawk Co., 105 U. S. 659; Shoecraft v.

This court early defined what is a "chose in action" as the term is used in the statute, and the term has a familiar meaning in our law literature and decisions.
The term is one of comprehensive import. It includes all the infinite varieties of contracts, covenants and promises which confer on one party a right to recover a personal chattel or a sum of money by action. Sheldon v. Sill, 8 How. 441; Bushnell v. Kennedy, 9 Wall. 387;

MR.,JUSTICE LAMAR, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court.

The appellants btought suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York for the purpose of recovering from the Trustee an interest in a trust estate which had been sold, transferred and assigned by Conrad Morris Braker, the beneficiary. The complainants were citizens and residents of Pennsylvania. Both defendants were citizens and residents of New York. Notwithstanding the diversity of citizenship, the court dismissed the bill on the ground that, as the assignor Braker, a citizen of New York, could not in the United States District Court, have sued Fletcher, Trustee and citizen of the same State, neither could the Complainants, his assignees, sue therein, even though they were residents of the State of Pennsylvania.
The appeal from that decision involves a construction of
§ 24 of the Judicial Code, which limits the jurisdiction of

BROWN v. FLETCHER.

Opinion of the Court.

the United States District Court when suit is brought

therein . . . "to recover upon any promissory note

or other chose in action in favor of any assignee. .

,1

This section of the Judicial Code is the last expression of

a policy intended to prevent certain assignees from pro-

ceeding in the United States courts.

The restriction was imposed not only to prevent fraud-

ulent transfers, made for the purpose of conferring juris-

diction, but in apprehension that promissory notes and

like papers might be transferred in good faith by the

citizens of one State to those of another, and thus render

the maker liable to suit in the Federal court. United

States Bank v. Planters'Bank, 9 Wheat. 904, 909.

Except for a short time when the act of March 3, 1875,

c. 137, 18 Stat. 470, restricted suits "founded on a con-

tract in favor of an assignee," the several statutes on the

subject, -in force prior to the adoption of § 24, made this

limitation on the jurisdiction of United States courts

apply to "any suit to recover the contents of any promis-

sory note or other chose in action in favor of any assignee"

(Act of September 24, 1789, c. 20, 1 Stat. 73, 78, § 11;

Rev. Stat., § 629; Act of March 3, 1887, c. 373, 24 Stat.

552; Act of August 13,, 1888, c. 866, 25 Stat. 433, 434).

These were technical terms of variable meaning. They

might have been given a literal construction, in which case

the act would not have wholly remedied the evil intended

to be corrected. They Were also susceptible of a construc-

tion so broad as to include subjects far beyond the con-

gressional policy. For a "chose in action embraces in

No district court shall have cognizance of any suit (except
upon foreign bills of exchange) to recover upon any promissory note or other chose in action in favor of any assignee, or of any subsequent holder if such instrument be payable to bearer and be not made by any corporation, unless such suit might have been prosecuted in such court to recover upon said note or other chose in action if no assignment had been made." 36 Stat. 1091.

one sense all rights of action." Dundas v. Bowler, 3 McLean, 204, 208. So that if the words of the statute had been given their most comprehensive meaning every assignee or vendee would have been prevented from suing in the United States court unless the assignor could have maintained the action. It is evident, however, ihat there was no intent to prevent assignees and purchasers of property from maintaining an action in the Federal court to recover such property, even though the purchaser was an assignee and the deed might, in a sense, be called a chose in action.
On the other hand, to construe the statute so as to only prohibit suits in such courts by the assignees of notes, drafts and written promises to pay, would have left open a wide field and enabled assignees of accounts and of claims arising out of breaches of contracts to proceed in the Federal courts, although the parties to the original agreement could not have there sued.
While, therefore, it was admitted in Sere v. Pitot, 6 Cranch, 332, that suits to recover the "contents of a chose in action" referred to "assignable paper," yet, in view of the general policy of the Act, these words were given a construction so broad as to include suits on accounts and on claims other than those containing written promises to pay.
That rulng, though criticized in Bushnell v. Kennedy, 9 Wall. 387, 393, was constantly followed (Sheldon v. Sill, 8 How. 441; Shoecraft v. Bloxham, 124 U. S. 730), and it has b~een settled that the prohibition applied not only to suits on instruments which might be said to have, "contents," but also to suits for the recovery of "all debts, and all claims for damages for breach of contract, or for torts connected with a contract . . . but . . . not to suits to recover the specific thing or damages for its wrongful caption or detention." Bushnell v. Kennedy, 9 Wall 387, 390, 391. Ibid. 392. Neither did it apply to suits

Opinion of the Court.

for damages for neglect of duty. Deshler v. Dodge, 16
How. 622, 631; Ambler v. Eppinger, 137 U. S. 480. Such is still the law under § 24; for, according to the
statutory rule for construing the Judicial Code 1 it may be assumed that the slight difference in language between the act of 1887 ("contents of a chose .in action in favor of the assignee") and § 24 ("suits upon a chose in action in favor of an assignee") was not intended to bring about any change in the law, but merely as a continuation of the existing statute. In continuing the statute Congress also carried forward the construction that the restriction on jurisdiction applied to suits for damages for breach of contract, but did not apply to suits for a breach of duty nor for a recovery of things. It therefore becomes necessary to determine whether these proceedings by Bill in Equity are suits by assignees on a chose in action; or, suits for the recovery of an interest in property by the transferee or assignee.
From the allegations of the two bills it appears that the $50,000, mentioned in the fifteenth item, and the $120,000, proceeds of the residuum of the estate referred to in the sixteenth item, had each been invested by the Trustee-but whether in real estate, tangible personal property, stocks or bonds is not stated.
If the trust estate consisted of land it would not be claimed that a deed conveying seven-tenths interest therein was a chose in action within the meaning of § 24 of the Judicial Code. If the funds had been invested in tangible personal property, there is, as pointed out in the Bushnell Case, nothing in § 24 to prevent the holder

I "SEc. 294. The provisions of this act, so fdr as they are substan-
tially the same as existing statutes, shall be construed as continuations thereof, and not as new enactments, and there shall be no implication of a change of intent by reason of a change of words in such statute, unless such change of intent shall be clearly manifest." 36 Stat. 1167.

by virtue of a bill of sale from suing for the "recovery of the specific thing or damages for its wrongful caption or detention." And if the funds had been converted into cash, it was still so far property-in fact instead of in action-that the owner, so long as the money retained its earmarks, could recover it or the property into which it can be traced, from those having notice of the trust. In either case, and whatever its form, trust property was held by the Trustee,-not in opposition to the cestui que trust so as to give him a chose in action, but-in possession for his benefit in accordance with the terms of the testator's will,
It is said, however, that this case does not relate to the sale of land, or of things, or even to a transfer of a definite fund, but to two assignments of $35,000,-to be made out of money or property in the hands of a trustee. It is claimed that this was an assignment of a chose in action within the meaning of § 24 of the Judicial Code. Givirp the words of the statute the most extensive construction authorized by previous decisions, they can only refer to a chose in action based on contract. Kolze v. Hoadley, 200 U. S. 76, 83. The restriction on jurisdiction is limited to cases where A is indebted to B on an express or implied promise to pay; B assigns this debt or claim to C, and C
as assignee of such debt sues A thereon or to foreclose the security. Or where A has contracted with B and B assigns the contract to C who sues to enforce his rights, by Bill for specific performance or, by an action for damages for breach of the contract. Shoecraft v. Bloxham, 124 U. S. 730, 735.
But here there was no contract and this is not a suit for a breach of a contract. For whatever may have been the earlier view of the subject (Holmes Common Law, 407, 409) the modern cases do not treat the relation between Trustee and cestui que trust as contractual. The rights of the beneficiary here depended not upon an agreement

BROWN v. FLETCHER.

235 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

between him and Braker, but upon the terms of the will creating the trust and the duty which the law imposed upon the Trustee because of his fiduciary position. And a proceeding by the beneficiary or his assignee for the enforcement of rights in and to the property, held-not in opposition to but-for the benefit of the beneficiary, could not be treated as a suit on a contract, or as a suit for the recovery of the contents of a chose in action, or as a suit on a chose in action. Upham v. Draper, 157 Massachusetts, 292; Herrick v. Snow, 94 Maine, 310. See also Edwards v. Bates, 7 Man. & G. 590; Nelson v. Howard, 5 Maryland, 327.
The beneficiary here had an interest in and to the property that was more than a bare right and much more than a chose in action. For he had an admitted and recognized fixed right to the present enjoyment of the estate with a right to the corpus itself when he reached the age of fifty-
five. His estate in the property thus in the possession of the Trustee, for his benefit, though defeasible, was alienable to the same extent as though in his own possession and passed by deed. Ham v. Van Orden, 84 N. Y. 257, 270; Stringer v. Young, Trustee, 191 N. Y. 157; Lawrence v. Bayard, 7 Paige, 70; Woodward v. Woodward, 16 N. J. (Eq.) 83, 84. The instrument by virtue of which that alien-
ation was evidenced,-whether called a deed, a bill of sale, or an assignment,-was not a chose in action payable to the assignee, but an evidence of the assignee's right, title, and estate in and to property. Assuming that the transfer was not colorable or fraudulent, the Federal statutes have
always permitted the vendee or assignee to sue in the United States courts to recover property or an interest in property when the requisite value and diversity of citizenship existed. Barney v. Baltimore, 6 Wall. 280. The equity jurisdiction of such courts extends to suits by heirs against executors and administrators (Security Co. v. Black River Bank, 187 U. S. 211, 228) and to suits against

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.

235 U. S.

Trustees for the recovery of an interest in the trust property by the beneficiary or his assignee.
The conclusion that § 24 of the Judicial Code did not deprive the District Court of jurisdiction, to enforce complainants' interest under the assignments executed by the cestui que trust, was foreshadowed in Ingersoll v. Coram, 211 U. S. 335, 361. That was a proceeding by an assignee to enforce an equitable lien on an heir's interest in an estate. In that case it was claimed that because the assignor could not have sued in the United States court, neither could the assignee maintain his Bill therein. The case Was disposed of on another ground but the court said that "it is certainly very disputable if an interest in a distributive share of an estate is within the statute."
That language was used in reference to a suit for the recovery of part of a fund in the hands of an executor, who held primarily for the payment of the testator's debts. There the legatees, distributees and assignees had no such vested interest in specific property as is the case here where all of the property in the hands of the Trustee was held for the purpose of paying the income to Braker until he reached the age of fifty-five, when the corpus was to be delivered to him [or to his assignees] in fee. That interest was transferable and the purchaser was not precluded by § 24 from suing in the United States court for the interest so transferred.
This view of the record makes it unnecessary to discuss the question as to whether the Executors of Wood could in any event be treated as assignees of the character referred to in §24 (Chappedelainev. Dechenaux, 4 Cranch, 305, 306), since their title was cast upon them by operation of law. The nature of the case is also such that we cannot consider the effect of an assignment of $35,000 out of the $50,000, if it shall appear that the trust estate in the hands of the Trustee consists of property and not of money. These are questions which the United States District

While the rule applicable to the Interstate Commerce Commission that an order made indisputably contrary to the evidence, or without any evidence, is arbitrary and subject to be set aside, may also be applicable to orders of the Kentucky Railroad Commission, in this case held, 'that there was substantial evidence to support the order establishing rates and the Commission had jurisdiction under the MeChord Act to make the order reestablishing a former rate.
Where the evidence shows that special rates on a particular commodity were voluntarily established and were maintained for many years after the avowed reason for introducing them had ceased to exist, and the carrier's reason for an advance was not because they were inadequate but because they gave rise to discrimination, there is a reasonable inference that the advanced rates are unreasonably high which is sufficient to give jurisdiction to the Kentucky Railroad Commission under the MeChord Act to make an order regstablishing the original rates and to support the conclusion that such rates were remunerative and should be reestablished.

A trust of certificates of stock to cause dividends thereon to be paid to a designated party as beneficiary for a specified period and on the expiration thereof to transfer the stock itself to the beneficiary if living unless childless in which event the trustee was to hold the stock and pay the dividends to the beneficiary during life and on the death of the beneficiary to distribute to designated parties, held,. in this case, to have failed in -iase of the death of the beneficiary within the period specified both as to the stock and the dividends and that the trustee was bound to return the stock to the donor and that i t did not pass to the heirs or personal representative of the beneficiary.
Injconstruinga declaration of trust, in this case in form of a ldter and phrased in simple language, the guiding principle is to seek the intention of the maker, as expressed in the instrument; and the court is not called upon to strain the meaning of words, as is sometimes done in the case of wills so as to avoid intestacy.
Where the death of the beneficiary defeats the trust and le ves the trustee without directions or authority to transfer the fund to any beneficiary, as he is fundus officio and cannot in equity rt tain the fund for himself, there is a resulting trust for the donor to whom he must redeliver the fund.

created by the late Alfred S. Hartwell, deceased, in his lifetime, Alfred W. Carter as the executor of the will of Alfred S. Hartwell, deceased, Mabel R. Hartwell, and the Hawaiian Sugar Company, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the Territory of Hawaii. The object of the bill was to require an accounting and transfer of 585 shares of the capital stock of the Sugar Company and the dividends declared thereon since August, 1909, including 2921 2 shares of new stock issued as a dividend. The case was heard upon an agreed statement of facts in substance as follows:
"Alfred S. Hartwell died in Honolulu on the 30th day
of August, 1912, leaving a will, duly proved in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit, Territory of Hawaii, on the 15th day of October, 1912. The defendant Alfred W. Carter was appointed executor in said will and qualified
and is now acting as such. Charles A. Hartwell, also appointed, did not qualify. The deceased was from 1868 to 1874 a judge of the Supreme Court' of Hawaii, from 1874 to 1904 one of the leading attorneys in Hawaii, and from 1904 to 1907 a judge, and from 1907 to 1911 chief justice of the Supreme Court of Hawaii. He was the father of seven daughters all of whom except Charlotte Lee Hartwell Chater now survive, to-wit, the five named in the instrument dated March 27, 1909, attached to the complaint herein marked 'Exhibit A,' namely: Charlotte Lee Hartwell Chater, Mabel R. Hartwell, Dorothy
Hartwell, Bernice Hartwell and Juliette Hartwell, ('Lottie Lee,' named in said instrument Exhibit 'A,' being Charlotte Lee Hartwell Chater, and 'Mabel,' being Mabel R. Hartwell), and also Madeline Hartwell Judd and Edith Hartwell Carter, the latter being then and now the wife of Alfred W. Carter, defendant. Charlotte Lee Hartwell Chater had been married to the complainant, Charles H. Chater, shortly before the date of said instrument, to-wit, on July 15, 1908, and was then on March 27, 1909,

the County of Middlesex, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, where she had been residing with her husband, Charles H. Chater, on the 3rd day of September, 1909, in childbirth, intestate, leaving the complainants, her husband, Charles H. Chater, and one child, the complainant, Charles Hartwell Chater, who was born on August 30, 1909; thereafterwards, on the 15th day of November, 1909, the Probate Court of the County of Middlesex duly appointed the complainant, Charles H. Chater, administrator of the estate of said Charlotte Lee Hartwell Chater, and issued letters.to him, and he duly qualified as such and is now aeting; and said Probate Court, on the 17th day of December, 1909, duly appointed said Charles H.

letters of guardianship to said Charles H. Chater, who qualified and is now guardian of said Charles Hartwell Chater.

another in your name as trustee for, Lottie Lee for 585 shares, also a certificate in Lottie Lee's name (being those which I gave her before she was married) for 250 shares, also three blank forms of receipts in duplicate for you to sign and hand to me, if you please.
"The trust for both Juliette and Dorothy is to see that the dividends are paid to them, or, what I presume would be better, placed to their credit with Bishop & Co. where each of them now has an account. If either of them should die before returning here her shares are to be divided between the two surviving unmarried girls; if neither of them returns both their shares to go to Bernice, if living, otherwise to all the surviving sisters equally. I am aware that this is simply a temporary arrangementI hope it is-and that either of them has a right to call upon you to make over the shares to her at any time.
"The trust for Lottie Lee is to cause the dividends to be paid to her during the three years from January 1st next and if she shall then be living to transfer the shares to her or hold them in trust for her benefit as she may in writing request, unless at the end of three years she
shall have no child living, in which case the trustee is to hold the stock paying her the dividends during her lifetime, with power to change the investment and vary it at any time at discretion and at her death to divid the trust funds or securities equally among her sisters who shall then be living, and if none shall then be living among their children. then living, my object being, as

'"Mr. Charles H. Chater, South Natick, Mass.
"My DEAR MR. CHATER: I have not been a good
Correspondent for I have had many cares and responsibilities resting upon me.
"I am simply writing to you now about a matter of Lottie Lee's which I do not wish to write to her under present conditions or to trouble her at all about it. It is this-before her marriage I had given her 250 shares of the Hawaiian Sugar Stock paying regularly a monthly dividend of $75. Since a sale was made last summer of my large holdings in the American Sugar Co. (Molokai ranch) I have paid off the heavy indebtedness which had been burdening me for several years and am now dividing the shares in the Hawaiian Sugar stock which formerly had been pledged for my indebtedness in such way as to give Lottie Lee 585 shares more, which I am placing with Alfred W. Carter in trust (as explained in my letter to him). 'to cause the dividends to be paid to her during the three years from January 1st next and if she shall then be living to transfer the shares to her or hold them in trust for her benefit as she may in writing request, unless at the end of the three years she shall have no child living, in which case the -trustee to hold the stock paying her the dividends during her lifetime, with power to change the investment and vary it at any time at discretion and at her death to divide the trust funds or securities equally among her sisters who shall then be living, and if none shall then be living among their children then living, my object being, as Mr Chater will observe, that as to these additional 585 shares they shall remain in my family.'
"'I have been in the habit of arranging with Charles Brewer & Co. in Boston to collect my salary and pay Lottie Lee $200 a month on my account; I .am now writing them to send her $250 instead on April 15, May 15, and

June 15. Alfred, as her trustee, will require receipts for the dividends on the 585 shares which he holds in trust, which will be $175.50 a month. I accordingly enclose receipts for Lottie Lee to sign and send to him.
"I will also cause the Brewers to continue to send the $75 a month for April, May and June dividends on the 250 shares, which I will collect here and have them pay on my account. One reason why I do not arrange for longer payment by them is that I am quite likely to go east in June--I hope to do so-and to see you all-and am aware of the uncertainties of life, you know. Alfred will arrange after that to send a bill of exchange to Lottie
Lee monthly for the entire $250.50 coming to her, less exchange, which will be a small sum if he arranges to have the New York agents do this, which I think he will.
"It might also be well for Lottie Lee to give Alfred her proxy as to the 250 shares which I am turning over to him, a form for which I am enclosing herewith.
"I am making the same apportionment of my property between Madeline, Lottie Lee, Juliette, Bernice and Dorothy, future arrangements for the others to await contingencies, and I am in my will giving my homestead here to Juliette, Bernice and Dorothy, while there will always be a home where any of their sisters and their
families will be welcome. "I am much gratified to learn that you are going out
to South Natick. I shall hope to be able to go out there this summer, in which case I may arrange to live in the old cottage (Aunt Martha's house) where my childhood and many of my later years were spent. I do not mean that I am not well assured of a welcome from you and Lottie Lee in the new Cottage, but by going into the old house I shall feel free, as you can see, to get a friend or two out there at any time when it will not interfere with Mabel and her family going there. At any rate I have not been there since my sister's death and that will be the place in

Statement of the Case.

238 U. S.

Alfred S. Hartwell in his own name by the defendant the Hawaiian Sugar Company. On the 18th day, of May, 1910, gaid Alfred S. Hartwell transferred said certificate
for 585 shares to the defendant, Mabel R. Hartwell, and the defendant Hawaiian Sugar Company issued a new certificate on that date to said defendant, Mabel R. Hartwell, in her name for 585 shares, she not knowing at the time that the stock was the same stock which her father had previously transferred to Alfred W. Carter, Trustee for her sister, Charlotte Lee 'Hartwell Chater, and having no knowledge of the terms of that trust but receiving the same without consideration and as a gift
from her father and not on any secret trust or understand-
ing. "It is conceded, if admissible, that the said transfer of
said stock by Alfred W. Carter to Alfred S. Hartwell was made by said Alfred W. Carterin-good faith and on demand of said Alfred S. Hartwell and under the advice of counsel sought and received by said Alfred W. Carter, and that the said transfer of said stock by Alfred S. Hartwell to Mabel R. Hartwell was made by said Alfred S. Hartwell
in good faith and under the advice of counsel sought and obtained by him after the demand for said stock made on him by said Charles H. Chater.
"On the 1st day of July, 1910, the Hawaiian Sugar Company declared a stock dividend of 50 per cent., paid the said Mabel R. Hartwell $20 for a fractional one-half share, and on July 2nd issued to the said Mabel R. Hart-well as said dividend 292 shares additional stock, which
Were included in a new certificate for 1552 shares in Mabel R. Hartwell's name, which 1552 shares are still standing in her name."
It was further stipulated that cash dividends were paid as they accrued to A. W. Carter, Trustee, from September, . 1909, to January, 1910, to Alfred S. Hartwell from that
date until May, 1910, and thereafter until the commence-

Argument for Appellants.

ment of the suit to Mabel R. Hartwell, subsequent diviidends having been retained by the company. The market value of the stock is likewise stated, showing that the sum in controversy exceeds the amount requisite for an appeal to this court. The following also appears:
"The estate of said Charlotte Lee Hartwell Chater is not indebted to any one; the known heirs are the complainants, Charles H. Chater and Charles Hartwell Chater; alid the-said Charles H. Chater consents that any interest which he may have in said stock or said dividends may be accounted for and paid to himself as guardian for said Charles Hartwell Chater."

Mr. David L. Withington, with whom Mr. Joseph P. Bell was on the brief, for appellants:
A present equitable title to the stock vested in Mrs.
Chater, which has never been divested. An equitable title passed to Mrs. Chater, subject to the
trust. The trust having expired by its own limitation, without
divesting the beneficiary of her title, the legal title followed the equitable title to the beneficiary or her estate.
There is no resulting trust to the donor in the case of a gift to a child.
There was a vested future interest to Mrs. Chater, which did not lapse on her death. General rules of construction favor a vested gift in this case. The law favors a vested, rather than a contingent, interest. A gift of intervening income is evidence of a vested gift of the principal. Failure of donor to provide a gift over is evidence that the gift was not intended to be contingent. The fact that like gifts made at the same time were treated by donor as vested is evidence that Chater gift was vested. Language in a trust is to be construed most strongly against the donor, the party using same. The language of the transaction itself shows a vested gift. There is an implied gift to

Opinion of the Court.

238 U. S.

Charles Hartwell Chater on the death of his mother before January 1, 1913. The exact language as to these dividends is one of an absolute vested gift. The general rules of construction favor a vested gift as to the dividends. The law favors a vested, rather than a contingent, gift. Where language sets out a completp gift the court will not override or cut it down unless the language contra is clear and unequivocal. The construction of the particular clause shows a vested gift. An annuity so passes. Gifts of income of real estate for years pass to the estate of the beneficiary. An interest in life insurance policy issued for the benefit of a person other than the insured, passes to the beneficiary's estute.
The defendAnts Mabel R. Hartwell, Alfred W. Carter, and Hawaiian Sugar Company are liable to the complainants.
Numerous authorities of this and other courts support these contentions.

Mr. Robbins B. Anderson for appellees.

MR. JUSTICE PITNEY, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court.

We have here a trust declared in writing by the late Judge Hartwell, of Hawaii, a man of ample means and of long experience as a practicing lawyer and judge, the father of seven daughters, four married, three unmarried, of whom five were named and in some way provided for in the trust instrument. The subject of the controversy is 585 shares of the stock of the Hawaiian Sugar Company, for which a certificate accompanied the trust instrument, the certificate being in the name of "Alfred W. Carter as Trustee for Charlotte Lee Hartwell Chater;" separate certificates being at the same time issued and delivered to .Mr. Carter as trustee for Juliette Hartwell and Dorothy

CUATER v. CARTER.

238 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Hartwell, respectively, and a certificate for 250 shares-in the name of Charlotte Lee Hartwell Chater being also delivered to him.
The date of the trust instrument is March 27, 1909. The particular clause out of which the controversy arises reads as follows:
"The trust for Lottie Lee is to cause the dividends to be paid to her during the three years from January 1st next and if she shall then be living to transfer the shares to her or hold them in trust for her benefit as she may in writing request, unless at the end of the three years she shall have no child living, in which case the trustee is to hold the stock paying her the dividends during her lifetime, with power to change the investment and vary it at any time at discretion and at her death to divide the trust funds or securities equally among her sisters who shall then be living, and if none shall then be living among their children then living, my object being, as Mr. Chater will observe, that as to these additional 585 shares they shall remain in my family."
The substance of this was copied into Judge Hartwell's explanatory letter to his son-in law, Mr. Chater, dated two days after the trust instrument, and which all parties have treated as throwing a legitimate light upon the meaning of that instrument.
The trust for Mrs. Chater was evidently created in view of her approaching maternity, an event that occurred about four months before "January 1st, next," and was followed by her death on the 3d of September, 1909, leaving a son, who still survives. The question is, Who is entitled to the shares of stock and to the dividends accruing after January 1, 1910?
Appellants contend (1) that upon the establishment of the trust accompanied by the delivery to the trustee of the stock certificate naming her as beneficiary, an equitable title passed to Mrs. Chater subject only to

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.

Opinion of the Court.

238 U. S.

the trust, and that when the trust expired by its own limitations the legal title followed the equitable title and
became vested in Mrs. Chater's estate; or (2) that there was a vested future interest in Mrs. Chater, which did not lapse upon her death; or (3) that even if the gift to Mrs. Chater was not vested there was an implied gift to her son upon her death prior to January 1, 1913. And, in any event, it is contended (4) that the gift of the dividends to Mrs. Chater for the period of three years from and after January 1, 1910, was absolute and passed to her estate.
Appellees contend, on the other hand, that by the terms and true meaning of the trust instrument there was no present gift to the beneficiary, expressed or implied, creating any interest, legal or equitable, but only
a direction to the trustee to pay or transfer the subject of the trust to the beneficiary at a future time upon express condition that she were then living; that her death before the first of January, 1910, defeated the trust as
to the dividends as well as the principal; and that since the trustee was thus left without directions or authority to transfer the stock or the dividends to any beneficiary, and could not hold them for himself, a resulting trust arose in favor of the donor.
The declaration of trust is in the form of a letter, and is clearly and simply phrased, without employment of technical terms. In seeking its true construction, little assistance can be had from technical rules. The guiding principle must be, to seek the intention of the settlor. We mean, of course, his intention as expressed. Not, What did he intend to say? but, What did he intend by what he did say? must be the test.
We cannot yield to the argument that because the stock certificate .was caused to be issued in the name of Mr. Carter as trustee for Mrs. Chater there was a present transfer of the equitable title to her, subject only to the terms of the declaration. The mention of her name in

CHATER v. CARTER.

238 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

the certificate had its proper purpose in earmarking the stock and identifying the trust to which it pertained; but the terms of that trust must be found in the accom-
panying letter. In construing it, we are not called upon to strain the
meaning of words, as is sometimes done to avoid intestacy when wills are to be construed. Judge Hartwell evidently contemplated that Mrs. Chater was to become a mother, and he makes the ultimate disposition of the stock (if she survives) turn upon the question whether she shall have a child or children living at the end of the designated period of three years from January 1, 1910; yet he makes'no provision for the child in the event of her death in the meantime. And even the payment of dividends to Mrs. Chater is postponed until January 1, 1910. We axe left without explanation of this, unless it be attributable to a purpose that the inception of the trust should depend upon her surviving the perils of childbirth. We must therefore reject the theory that there was a vested future interest in Mrs. Chater or an implied gift to her child in the event of her death prior to January 1,1913. As to the dividends, the gift of these must likewise be treated as contingent upon her surviving to receive them; for it was not even a gift in terms, but only a direction to pay them to her during the three years from January 1, 1910.
The main purpose, as expressed, was to hold the principal fund until January 1, 1913, when, if Mrs. Chater were living and had a living child or children, she should decide for herself whether to take the fund into her own hands or allow the trustee to continue to hold it for her benefit; but if she had no child living, the trustee was to hold the fund, giving her the income only, and at her death. dividing the fund among her sisters, etc.,-"my object being, as Mr. Chater will observe, that as to these additional shares they shall remain in my family."

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.

Syllabus.

238 U. S.

Mrs. Chater was the chief object of the bounty. What she was to receive, and when she was to receive it, were stated in plain terms. Beyond this, we think there are none of the implications that are deemed to arise in cases
of wills. But the event that happened-her death before Jan-
uary 1, 1910-although evidently in contemplation as a possible event, was not provided for. What then happens? The trust has failed; the trustee is functus officio; he cannot in equity retain the fund for himself; he must simply redeliver it to him from whom it came. In other words, there is a resulting trust for the donor.
The entire matter is so fully and satisfactorily discussed in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Hawaii that we need not further elaborate it.

Nothing in the Federal Constitution gives any one the right to have the jury instructed that he is entitled to damages for property taken, where the instruction is not based on some evidence or entitles him to damages without proof.
After an elevated railroad had been built in a street, the jury, in a suit brought by an abutting owner, viewed the premises, and the only testimony showed that the property was worth more after, than before, the erection of the structure; held, that the owner was not entitled to an instruction that the jury must exclude from their estimate of market value subsequent to the construction any enhancement from the facilities furnished to the property by the structure
