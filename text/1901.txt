BEYER v. LEFEVRE..
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
No.237. Argued April 25, 28, 1902.-Declded May 19,1902.
The agreement of parties to submit questions to a jury, the trial there, and a stipulation for returning the testimony for consideration is a waiver of. objection to'jurisdiction.
When the trial court and the appellate court agree as to the facts established, this court accepts their conclusion.
Under the facts in this case the jury were not warranted in finding that the execution of the will was procured by fraud or undue influence.
It is the rule of the Federal courts that the will of a person found to be possesied of sound mind and memory, is not to be set aside on evidence tending to show only a possibility or suspicion of undue influence.
THIS was a bill filed in the Supreme Court of this District on April 7, 1899, to set aside the following will:
;"In th name of God, Amen. "I Mary Beyer of the city and county of Washington and District of Columbia being now of sound and disposing mind, do make, ordain, publish and declare this to be my last will and testament: That is to say, first after all my lawful debts are paid and discharged the residue of my estate, real and personal I give, devise, bequeath, and dispose of as follows: to wit all the furniture and personal effects now in the home, number 2258 Brightwood avenue 1 desire to remain there during the life of 'my husband Louis Beyer or so long as it remains the family ,homd and'in the event of the house not being retained as a family home then the furniture and all other personal effects belonging to me are to go to and belong to my nephew and adopted son born Charles Lewis Smith but adopted by me at birth and thereafter always called Louis Beyer, Junior. "To my sister Elizabeth Kersinski Maus of Philadelphia Pa. I leave five dol lars: "To my sister Caroline Kersinski LeFevre of Brookland D. C. I leave five dollars.

The parties named as defendants were Louis Beyer, the husband of the testatrix; Louis B yer, Juniori a nephew; Helen B. Johnson, a niece; Louis Beyer, Junior, as executor,, and 'Meyer Cohen and Adolph G. Wolf, trustees in a deed of trust executed by the husband of the testatrix on May 13, 1897. The ground of attack was the alleged mental incapacity of the testatrix and undue influence on the part of Louis Beyer, Junior, and Helen B. Johnson. The personal property belonging to the testatrix was of little value, but she owned certain real estate, subject to a trust deed, which in the bill was alleged to be of the value of $25,000 over and above the incumbrance. Louis Beyer, Junior, and Helen B. Johnson, answering separately, denied mental unsoundness and undue influence; alleged that the will was' duly executed, and challenged the jurisdiction of the court, sitting as a court of equity, to entertain the bill. The trustees pleaded that the bill stated nothing entitling the complainint to relief in equity, and averred that their deed of trust
.was a valid lien. Louis Beyer demurred generally. On June20, the court having made no ruling upon the question of jurisdiction, the parties signed this stipulation: "It is hereby stipulated by'and between the parties to this -cause this 20th day of June, 1899, that the court may make an order certifying certain issues, to be named in said order, to be tried by , jury of the Oircuit Court, and that the findings by said jury upon said issues shall be returned to this court; whereupon a decree shall be entered in accordance with said findings, all rights of appeal a in cases of issues from, the orphans' court ,being hereby reserved."
And thereupon the court made this order:

BEYER v. LEFEVRE.
Statement of the Case.
"Ordered by the court this 20th day of June, 1899, (the parties to this cause consenting hereto,) that the following issues to be tried by a jury be, and they hereby are, certified to the Circuit Court to wit:
"First. Was the said Mary Beyer at the time of tle alleged execution of the paper-writing bearing date the 14th day of July; A. D. 1896, and purporting to be her last will and testament, of sound and disposing mind, memory and understanding and capable of executing a valid deed or contract?
"Second. Was the execution of the said paper-writing bearing date the 14th day of July, 1896, and purporting to be the last will and testament of the said Mary Beyer, procured by fraud, circumvention or undue influence practiced or exercised upon the said Mary Beyer by Louis Beyer, Jr., Helen B. Johnson, or by either of them or by any other person?
"Third. Were the contents of the paper-writing bearing date July 14th, 1896, and purporting to be the last will and testament of said Mary Beyer:, known to her at the time of the alleged execution thereof ?"
This order was assented to by all the parties. In pursuance thereof the case came on for trial before Mr. Justice Cole and a jury, and the jury, after hearing the testimony and the instructions of the court, answered each of the questions in the affirmative. A motion for a new trial was overruled by the presiding judge. A stipulation was entered into by the parties that the full report of the testimony and proceedings had before Mr. Justice Cole and the jury should be produced, read and heard by the equity court as a part of the record on the hearing in that court and in the appellate court to which the cause might be carried by either or any of the parties. Thereupon a full report of the proceedings was presented to Mr. Justice Barnard, holding the equity court, who, on May 14, 1900, filed an opinion sustaining the verdict of the jury, and directing a decree in accordance with the prayers of the bill. From that decree Louis Beyer, Louis Beyer, Junior, and Helen B. Johnson appealed to the Court of Appeals. On December 6, 1900, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decree. From that decree Louis Beyer, a severance being had, appealed to this court.

.rL. Clayton E. Ewing and .Mr. Oharle8 Poe for appellee.
MR. JUSTICE BREWER, after making the above statement, delivered the opinion of the court.
The appellant contends, first, that the Supreme Court of the District, sitting as a court of equity, had no jurisdiction of this cause; second, that the verdict of the jtiry was not sustained by the evidence.; and, third, that there was duress and coercion .of the jury by the court, which resulted in an unjust verdict.
We pass the first question with the observation that, whatever might -have been the conclusion if the defendants had stood upon their challenge of the jurisdiction, the agreement of the parties to submit certain questions to a jury, the trial before the jury and the stipulation for returning the testimony there taken to the equity court for co-nsideration by the judge thereof, niust be held a waiver of the objection to the jurisdiction. Under the Federal system the same judge may preside whether the court is sitting in equity or as a common law court. While the pleadings and procedure are dissimilar and the rights of the parties, especially in respect to juries, are different, yet in. many cases a party who appears in one branch of the court and consents to a hearing and adjudication, according to the practice there prevailing, of an issue presented by the pleadings and in respect to a subject-matter, which is within the general scope of its jurisdiction, may be estopped from thereafter and in an appellate court challenging such jurisdiction. Reynes v. Dumont, 130 U. S. 354, 395. This is such a case. The -determination of the title to real estate is within the scope of the general jurisdiction of a court of equity. The issue of undue influence in respect to*any transaction such a court is competent to determine. The proceeding consented to, and in fact had, was practically*the trial of a feigned issie out of chancery. It is too late now to raise the question of jurisdiction.
Passing to thie second question, we premise by saying that

it is well settled that when the trial and the appellate courts agree as to the facts established on the trial, this court will accept their conclusion and not attempt to weigh conflicting testimony. . Stuart v. "Hayden, i69 U. S. 1, 14, and authorities

weight when in the first instance the facts are found by a master or a jury. FIurrerv. fferri8, 145 U. S. 132, and cases cited in the opinion. These propositions we have often affirmed. At the same time there has always been recognized,. the right and the duty of this court to examine the record, and if it finds that the conclusions are wholly unwarranted by the'
testimony it will set the verdict or report aside and direct a reexamination. And after having carefully examined the record in this case we are constrained to the conclusion that there is no testimony which justified the answer returned to the second question. On the contrary, if a will is set aside upon such a flimsy showing as was made of undue influence, few wills can hope to stand.
The facts are these: The testatrix was a woman sixty-five years of age; had been married forty-five years, but was childless; her relations with her husband and sisters were'pleasant; her near relatives were two sisters, Caroline LeFevre, the preeent appellee, and Mrs. Maus, the mother of Helen B. Johnsom Another sister had died many years ago, leaving two children, Charles Lewis Smith (known in the record as Louis Beyer, Junior) and Helen 0. Fenton. Louis Beyer, Junior, while a little child, and on the death of his mother, xi'as taken by the testatrix and brought up as her son. There does not appear to have been any formal adoption, but he went by the name of Louis Beyer, Junior, and was recognized and treated as her, son. He was twenty-seven years old at the time of her death. Helen B. Johnson was, as stated, the daughter of Mrs. Maus, a sister of testatrix. She, too, lived with the testatrix the most of her life,.although it does not appear that she had been recognized as a daughter. The testatrix died of cancer in the abdomen. The first indications of trouble were in December, 1893, though at that time the appearances were of an ordinary,

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.
case of indigestion, and the fact that it was cancer was not developed until some time in the early part of 1896, the year in which she died. In the month of June of that year she went on a visit to the home of Helen Johnson's mother-in-law, twelve miles south of Richmond. She returned about the first of July, was about the house for a week or so after her return, and then took to her bed, dying on July 26. When spoken to, at different times prior to her visit to Richmond, about making a will she had declined, saying she intended the property should go to her husband; but being advised, either before or after her visit to Richmond, that in case she died without a will the property would go to her sisters and their descendants, she decfded to have a will made, and so informed Louis Beyer, Junior, on Sunday, July 12; she also inquired if a will made on Sunday was valid, and was told by him, after an examination of a cyclopaedia, that it would be. He suggested an attorney living near, to whom she objected, whereupon he proposed to call in Mr. Brennan, who occupied an office in the same building in which he was employed. This was satisfactory. Mr. Brennan was sent for. Witnesses were asked to attend, among them her regular physician. Mr. Brennan came in the afternoon, found her lying in bed, received instructions from her how she wanted the will drawAi, and wrote it then and there. It was thereafter read to her, signed and acknowledged by her in the presence of himself, the regular physician, and a Mr. Sullivan, and signed by them as witnesses. That will was similar to the one finally executed, except that it devised the property to -LouisBeyer, Junior, alone. Mr. Brennan took the will to his office. On examination he found that he had left out the word "heirs," so that, as he thought, only a life estate .would pass to the devisee, and on Monday prepared a new will, exactly like the one which had been executed, with the addition of the word "heirs." He called on the testatrix and explained the change he had made; she then said that, inasmuch as there had to be a new will executed, she would like to have Mis. Johnson included -with Louis Beyer, Junior. Whereupon Mr. Brennan went to his office and wrote a will the third time, and on Tuesday went back to the house, and there it was executed.

BEYER v. LEFEVRE.
Opinion of the Court
That is the will in dispute. It was taken by him to his office and kept in his hands until after her death. That the contents of this will were known to her at the time of its execution, and that she was "of sound and disposing mind, memory and understanding, and capable of executing a valid deed or contract," were found by the jury, and were abundantly proved by the testimony, among the witnesses thereto being her regular physician, the minister who visited her, the lawyer who drafted the will, and others wholly disinterested. o Before noticing what is claimed to be evidence of undue in-
fluence, w* remark that the will was not an unnatural one for the testatrix to make. As long as she supposed her husband would inherit the real estate, she declined to make any. She meant that he should have the benefit of the property. She found, however, that.it was necessary for her to make a will in order to secure this result. He was an old man, and in the natural course of events could not be expected to live many years. It is not strange that, with the utmost affection for her sister's, she should prefer that, after he had had the enjoyment of her property, it should go to the nephew and niece who had made their home with her, who had been brought' up by her, and one of whom, at least, was regarded as an -adopted child. So she makes a will vesting the fee in them, but charged with theduty of furnishing a home to her husband as long as he lived, and relying upon their affection to give to him the comforts of'a, home such as they all had had together in the past. While she gave them the power of alienation, she coupled with it the proviso that whatever was done with this property they should still secure a home to him during his lifetime. She trusted much to their affection, but is this singular considering the length of time they had been members of her family and that which she must have known to be the- relation subsisting between them and him I Yet she did not leave provision for her husband entirely to their affection. She directed in terms that such prbvision should. be made, and she doubtless believed that that direction would be binding, and it was, binding. It was in the nature of a precatory trust, and so expressed as to be obligatory upon the devisees and enforcible in the courts. Colton v. Coldn,

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.
127 U. S. 300. It is no ground of criticism that others might have made a different will. That she did not give the fee to her husband, but to her adopted son and niece, burdened with this precatory trust, may have been owing to a fact which is, at least, suggested by the testimony, that her husband was visionary, and she feared might waste his property in developing some of his supposed inventions. That she was justified in placing confidence in the affection of the devisees for her husband is shown by the fact that they conveyed to him a large portion of the property upon hearing that he was dissatified with the contents of the will. It is true that some time thereafter, owing to his contemplated marriage, the pleasant relations between him and them seem to have ceased, but this unfortunate condition does not prove that the testatrix did not at the time have good reason to trust in their affection for him.
Turning now to the testimony ofered to show undue influence, it comes from two witnesses, Mrs. Stone, the daughter of the appellee, and Fanny Perry, a colored servant in the house of the testatrix. -Mrs.Stone's testimony is mainly concerning the condition of the testatrix during her last sickness, and had a tendency to show that she was in a drowsy condition, if not unconscious, during the last fourteen days of her life, though as she was at the house of the testatrix only every other day, and then for but a few minutes at a time, her testimony was properly considered by the jury as of no great significance and overborne by that of the physician and other witnesses. She does testify to one thing in reference to Mrs. Johnson, which will be considered hereafter. The only other witness, and the one upon whom the appellee substantially relies, is Fanny Perry, the servant. Now, in respect to her testimony, and indeed all the testimony in the case, it must be observed that there is not a syllable tefiding to show that Louis Beyer, Junior, ever urged the testatrix to make a will, ever suggested or spoke to her in respect to the matter, and that all the connection he had with it was in response to requests to ascertain what would be the disposition of the property without a will, the validity of a will made on Sunday, and in suggesting the name of a lawyer to prepare thewill and asking him to come. Now, to find that

BEYER v. LEFEYRE.
Opinion of the Court.
the will was obtained by undue influence on his part, when there is not the slightest syllable tending to show that he ever said or did a thing toward securing the execution of the will except at her request, is a proposition which cannot for one moment be entertained. With this must also be remembered that the will which was first drawn, the one executed on Sunday, made him the sole devisee, and that it was intended by the testatrix to vest the property absolutely in him, so as to deprive the appellee and other of her relatives of any interest in the property. That it did not have that effect was owing to a mistake of the scrivener in omitting the word "heirs," a mistake which, when discovered by him, he proceeded promptly to correct, and only when the corrected will was presented to her did she authorize a change so as to include Mrs. Johnson. Suppose it were true that Mrs. Johnson did after the first will by her importunity persuade the testatrix to include her as a devisee, the change wrought no prejudice to the interests of the appellee. It took away nothing from her. It only added a new devisee, and that not the appellee-another one to share in the
property. "Butnow, let us see what is the testimony which is claimed
to show that Mrs. Johnson exercised undue influence. Mrs. Stone testified that she boarded with the testatrix for a couple of years, (and that was a year or two before the death of testatrix,) and that during that time, when. Mrs. Johnson seemed displeased at something, she heard the testatrix say that "it was because she did not make a will and she never intended to make a will." Fanny Perry testified that she lived with the testatrix, about three years prior to her death; that 'Mrs. Stone called at the house on the Sunday when the irst will was exe6uted, and she heard Mrs. Johnson say to Louis Beyer, Junior, "you go down stairs, and after you get the wagon hitched up take Mrs. Stone around to the Christian Endeavor encampment first, and then take her home; if she knows what is going on here she won't leave here to-night unless she gets a share -inthe profits; " that she had heard Mrs. Johnson ask the testatrix to make a will, but the testatrix refused, saying that she would leave everything to Mr. Beyer just as it was, and for them to

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.
stay with him and treat him right, and when he died he would do right by them. To which Mrs. Johnson replied: "This is the way you are going to treat me after I have been working for you all these years, and this will be all the thanks I'll get for doing it;" that after the testatrix had taken to her bed she asked her to make a will, but she said she would not, but would leave the property to her husband, to which Mrs., Johnson said: "Yes, you will leave it to him, and he will sink it in a boat or rum inill ;" and the testatrix replied: "Nellie, how can you talk about your uncle like that? " and also, "Nellie, you are harassing me to death." Whereupon Mrs. Johnson said she would go if the will was not made, and the testatrix replied: "You have run Mis. Stone out of the house to get something when I die. You said she was waiting for a dead man's shoes, but you are the one to catch it."
We put out of consideration the fact that Mrs. Johnson contradicts the witness and denies ever having urged the testatrix to make a will in her behalf or to miake a will at all, and inquire whether, giving the fullest weight to this testimony, it warrants a finding that the execution of this will was secured by undue influence. We are clear that it does not. The conversations which the witness states were had while the testatrix was about the house and attendifig to her ordinary duties were conversations which might naturally be had between one brought up in the family, as Mrs. Johnson was, and one who had, been to her as a mother. It would not be strange that having lived all her life in the family she felt that there was something due to her in respect to the disposition of the property. It will be remembered that it is not influence, but undue influence, that is charged, and is necessary to overthrow a will. The question No. 2 puts in the same category fraud, circumvention and undue influence. Placing undue influence along with fraud and circumvention interprets the character of the influence. ' oscitur a sooiis. Surely there is nothing in these conversations which has .in it anything suggestive of fraud or circumvention, nothing wrongful or misleading.
With referene to the last conversation detailed by -the witness, that which took place after the testatrix had taken to her

Opinion of the Court.
bed, it may be conceded that there is a lisplay of urgency and petulance on the part of Mrs. Johnson and a rebuke on the part of the testatrix, but is there enough in it to justify a finding that the will was procured by undue influence? May not one situated as was Mrs. Johnson properly plead her claims for recognition in a will? May-she not give her reason- why a will should be made and why property should not be left to a particular person without being subject to the charge o exerting undue influence? The only threat, made by her was that she would go if the will was not made., We do not, of course, approve of such importunity to a sick person, and it may often be carried to such an extent that a jury is justified in finding that a will was executed in pursuance of it, and through undue influ ence, but these significant facts must be borne in .mind in respect to this case: The witness, Fanny Perry, does not locate the time of this conversation, whether before the first will was executed or after. If before, plainly it had no effe6t upon thetestatrix, for she made a will giving the property to her adopted son and leaving Mrs. Johnson out all together. If after, while it may have had the effect of causing the insertion of Mrs. John-son's name in the second, such change wrought no injury to the rights of the appellee. If the testatrix had -made up her mind to give her property to. an adopted child with a precatory trust'in behalf of her husband, then any change made in the devisees, as the result of whatever importunity, was a change which wrought no prejudice to the parties who were not naned in either will.
We are clearly of the opinion that the jury were not under the circumstances of this case warranted in finding that the execution of the will was procured by fraud, circumvention or undue influence practised or exercised upon the testatrix.
One who is familiar with the volume of ligitation which is now flooding the courts cannot fail to be attracted by the fact that actions to set aside wills are of frequent occurrence. In such actions the testator cannot be heard, and very trifling matters are often pressed upon the attention of the court or jury as evidence of want of mental capacity or of the existence of undue influence. Whatever rule may obtain elsewhere we wish

Statement of the Case.
it distinctly understood to be the rule of the Federal courts that the will of a person found to be possessed of sound mind and memory is not to be set aside on evidence tending to show only a possibility or suspicion of undue influence. The expressed intentions of the testator should not be thwarted without clear reason therefor.
The decrees of the Court of Appeals and of the Supreme Court of the District are reversed and the case remanded to the latter court, with instructions to set aside the decree in favor of the appellee, and for further proceedings in conformity to this opinion.

MOORE v. RUOKGABER.
CERTIFICATE FROM THE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT.
No. 295. Argued November 21, 1901.-Decided March 17, 192.
The war tax law of 1898does not applyto intangible personal propertylocated in this country and passing by the will of an alien domiciled abroad, to a daughter who is also an alien domiciled abroad, although the will was executed in this country during a temporary sojourn here.
As the tax is not imposed upon the property but upon the succession to the property, the law of the country in which the succession takes place determines the liability to taxation.
The law does not apply to property passing under a will, if it would not apply in case the testator had died intestate, and as in this case the property would have passed under the intestate laws of France, the succession is not subject to a tax here, although the will was executed in this country.
THIS was also an action brought in the Circuit Court for the Southern District of New York by Ruckgaber, as executor of the last will and testament of Louisa Augusta Ripley-Pinode, against the Collector of Internal Revenue, to recover an inheritance tax paid to the defendant upon certain personal property in the city of New York. It was argued with No. 287, ante, 578.
The material facts, as set forth in the certificate, are briefly as follows:
The testatrix, Louisa Augusta Ripley-Pinde, died at Zitrich, Switzerland, on September 25, 1898, being at that time a nonresident of the United States, and having, for at least eight years immediately preceding her death, been domiciled in, and a permanent resident of, the Republic of France. She left a will dated November 6, 1890, which was made in New York and in conformity to the laws of that State, where the testatrix was then sojourning, whereby she bequeathed all her personal property in the United States to her daughter, Carmelia von Groll, who was then, and is now, also a non-resident of the United States, domiciled in Germany. Said will was probated
VOL. OLXXXV-38

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Statement of the Case.
in the Surrogate's Court of Kings County, New York, on February 17, 1899, and letters testamentary were thereupon issued to the defendant in error, a resident of said county and State, who alone qualified as executor.
At the time of her death the testatrix owned a claim in account current against one Carl Goepel and one Max Ruckgaber, Jr., constituting the firm of Schulz & Ruckgaber, both of whom resided in the county of Kings and State of New York. She was also the owner of a share of stock in The Tribune Association, a New York corporation. The testatrix was also the owner of bonds and coupons of divers American corporations hereinafter particularly described. Said chose in action, stock, bonds and certificate constituted all the personal property of every kind in the United States of America referred to in the said will. The value of the said property of the testatrix at the date of her death, September 25, 1898, as fixed and determined by appraisers duly appointed, was $105,670.70. On or about the 15th day of June, 1899, upon the written demand of the collector of internal revenue for the first district of New York, and under protest the executor did make and render in duplicate to the said collector a return of legacies arising from personal property of every kind whatsover, being in charge or trust of said executor, passing from Louisa Augusta RipleyPinide to her said daughter by her will, as aforesaid.
The following questions of law which arose out of the foregoing facts were certified to this court:
"1. Can the said personal property of the non-resident testatrix, Louisa Augusta Ripley-Pingde, actually located within the United States at the time of her death, September 25, 1898, be deemed to have a situs in the United States for the purpose of levying a tax or duty upon the transmission or receipt thereof under sections 29, 30 and 31 of the act of Congress entitled 'An act to provide ways and means to meet war expenditures, and for other purposes,' approved June 13, 1898 ?"
"2. Was the transmission or receipt of the said personal property of the non-resident testatrix, Louisa Augusta RipleyPin~de, which was actually located in the United States at the time of her death, September 25, 1898, subject to taxation un-

Mr. Afred E. Hinrick8 for defendant in error.
MR. JusTIcE BrowN, after making the above statement, delivered the opinion of the court.
This case differs from the one just decided only in the fact that the will of the non-resident testatrix was executed in New York, November 6, 1890, during a temporary sojourn there, although, as in the preceding case, the testatrix was domiciled abroad, and bequeathed her personal property in New York to a daughter, who was married, and also lived abroad.
There can be no doubt whatever that, if Madame Pinode had died intestate, the personal property would not have passed by the law "of any State or Territory," (using the words of the act,) but by the laws of France. The question then is, whether the condition is changed, if the property pass under a will executed in this country. In the United States v. Hunnewell, 13 Fed. Rep. 617, cited in the preceding case, the will was executed in France, but the decision of Mr. Justice Gray, holding that the tax was not payable, was not put upon the ground that the will was executed in a foreign country, but upon the broader ground that the legacy duty was payable only upon the estate of persons domiciled within the United States. In delivering the opinion he observed: "Section 124 " (of the similar act of 1864) "imposes a duty on legacies or distributive shares arising from personal property 'passing from any person possessed of such property, either by will, or by the intestate laws of any State or Territory;' it does not make the duty payable when ' the person possessed of such property' dies testate, if it would not be payable if such person died intestate; and if Madame de la Valette had died intestate, her son would not have taken a distributive share ' by the intestate laws of

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.
any State or Territory,' but, if at all, by the law of France, the doinicil of his mother at the time of her death. And section 125, by requiring the executor or administrator to pay the amount of this duty ' to the collector or deputy collector of the district of which the deceased person was a resident' leads to the same conclusion."
The real question then is, as said by Mr. Justice Gray, whether the act makes the duty payable when the person possessed of such property dies testate, if it would not be payable if such person died intestate, although the actual question involved in this case differs from the one there involved, in the fact that in the Hunnewell case the will was executed abroad, while in the present case it was executed in this country.
Bearing in mind the fact that the tax in this case is not upon the property itself, but upon the transmission or devolution of such property, the question again recurs, as it did in the preceding case, whether the succession took effect in France or in New York. We are aided in the solution of this problem by the language of section 2694 of the New York Code of Civil Procedure, also cited in the preceding case, which is as follows: 'Except where special provision is otherwise made by law, the validity and effect of a testamentary disposition of any other" (than real) "property situated within the State, and the ownership and disposition of such property where it is not disposed of by will, are regulated by the laws of the State or country of which the decedent was a resident at the time of his death." Now as, if Madame Pin~de had died without leaving a will, her property would have passed under the intestate laws of France and been exempt from this tax, it follows under the Eiunewell case that it is equally exempt though it passed by will.
The will of Madame Pinde is confined to her personal property in this country, and the record does not show whether she was possessed of other property in France or in any other foreign country. If she had, that property would either pass by will executed there or under the intestate laws of her domicil. For reasons stated in the prior opinion, we do not think Congress contemplated by this act that the estates of deceased persons should be split up for the purposes of distribution or taxa-

Opinion of the Court.
tion, but that, so far as regards personal property, the law of the domicil should prevail.
A question somewhat to the converse of this arose in the state of Romaine,127 N. Y. 80, which was a proceeding to compel payment of an inheritance tax by the administrator of the estate of Romaine, who had died intestate in Virginia, leaving a brother and sister resident in New York, as his next of kin. The act of 1887 subjected to an inheritance tax "all property which shall pass by will or by the intestate laws of this State, from any person who may die seized or possessed of the same while a resident of this State, or if such decedent was not a resident of this State at the time of his death, which property or any part thereof shall be within this State." The question was whether the property of Romaine, who died in Virginia intestate, was subject to the tax. After deciding that the tax applied to two classes, namely, resident and non-resident decedents, the court observed: "But does it apply to all persons belonging to these two classes ' It is not denied that it applies to all residentdecedents, and to all non-resident testators,but it is contended that it does not apply to non-resident intestatesbecause property ' which shall pass . . .. by the intestate laws of this State ' is expressly mentioned to the implied exclusion of property passing by the intestate laws of other States. This is the position of the appellant, whose learned counsel claims that the act, in its present form, was designed to meet cases of succession by will, but not of succession by intestacy, unless the intestate was a resident of this State. It is difficult, however, to see why the legislature should discriminate simply for the purposes of taxation between the property of a nonresident decedent who made a will, and of one who did not. It is not probable that there was an intention to tax the estates of non-resident testators and to exempt those of non-resident intestates, because there is no foundation for such a distinction. . . . Property of the same kind, situated in the same place, receiving the same protection from the law, and administered upon in the same way, would naturally be required to contribute toward the expenses of government upon the same basis, regardless of whether its last owner died testate or intestate."

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Statement of the Case.
By parity of reasoning, we think it follows that no discrimination was intended to be made between non-residents who died testate, even though the will were made in this country, and those who died intestate; and as we have held in the preceding case that the law does not apply to non-residents who died intestate, or testate under a will executed abroad, we think it follows that it does not apply to deceased persons domiciled abroad who left property by will executed in this country.
The questions certified must, therefore, be answered in the negative.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE and MR. JUSTICE M KENNA concurred in the result.

BUSCH v. JONES.

APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF Ct

'";,

No. 96. Argued January 14, 1902.-Decided March 17, 1902.

The appellees' contention as to jurisdiction in this case is not justified for reasons expressed in Clark v. Wooster, 119 U. S. 322, and Beedle v. Ben-
nett, 122 U. S. 71. This was an action to recover for infringements of a patent. The lower
courts found as a fact that all the claims of the patent had been infringed by appellant, and the evidence sustains the finding. The accounting in the lower court, however, was had upon the basis of the validity of the process, and therefore the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be reversed and the cause remanded with directions to that court to reverse the judgment and decree of the Supreme Court, and remand the cause to the latter court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.

THIS suit was brought by appellees against appellant for the infringement of letters patent No. 204,741, and letters patent No. 452,898, issued to Joshua W. Jones, one of the appellees. An accounting was prayed, and also an injunction, pending the suit. The bill contained the usual allegations of invention and utility, and of infringement by the defendant (appellant). The

FIDELITY MUTUAL LIFE ASSOCIATION v.METTLER.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS.
No. 165. Argued January 31, 1902.-Decided MIay 5, 1902.
The classification of life and health insurance companies separately from fire, marine and inland insurance companies, and mutual benefit and relief organizations doing business through lodges and mutual benefit associations, made by the State of Texas in respect of insurance, is not so arbitrary and destitute of reasonable basis as to be obnoxious to constitutional objection.
In an action on a life insurance policy it is not necessary to prove the fact of death beyond a reasonable doubt. A verdict for the party in whose favor the weight of evidence preponderates will be sustained.
The inference of death may arise from disappearance under circumstances inconsistent with a continuation of life.
The belief of the family of an assured that lie is dead is not admissible on the trial of an action on a policy of insurance on his life as independent evidence of the fact of his death, but the entertainment of such belief may be proven as tending to show innocence of fraud. And, in this case, the evidence which was admitted cannot be presumed, the entire record considered, to have had any influence whatever on the verdict except from the point of view in which it was admissible.
No other objection urged constituted reversible error or requires particular mention.
THIS was an action brought by Jennie M. Mettler in the District Court of Dallas County, Texas, December 2, 1897, and removed to the Circuit Court of the United States for the Northern District of Texas, against the Fidelity Mutual Life Insurance Association of Philadelphia, to recover on three policies of insurance upon the life of one William A. Hunter, payable to his widowed sister, Jennie M. -Mettler, each stipulating for the payment of $5000 in case of Hunter's death. The policies were dated in October, 1896, and Hunter paid at the time of their delivery the sum of $32.55 on each policy, and agreed to pay on each a like sum semi-annually thereafter, on the 28th day of the

FID. MUT. LIFE ASSN. v. METTLER.
Statement of the Case.
months of April and October, for the period of ten years from October 28, 1896.
At the commencement of the trial "1defendant admitted that all matters of proof relating to the death of the insured, all formal proofs, are sufficient, and that the only question to be tried and involved is the question of whether or not W. A. Hunter is dead as claimed in plaintiff's petition, and whether he died in the manner and form as alleged therein."
The evidence tended to show that Hunter left Mrs. Mettler's house on the third of December, 1896, announcing his intention to go to Mentone, in Loving County, for the purpose of making proof of a section of land in that county belonging to him, and which he had occupied for three years; that he left with a team consisting of a wagon and two horses, with hay, provisions, camping outfit, cooking utensils, and a gun; and that he expected to be absent a week or ten days, intending, at a later period, after having returned from Mentone, to go back to that place; that shortly before leaving he handed to a lawyer a package of papers sealed in a large envelope, which he asked should be kept in a vault, and which packages contained the policies of insurance; and that Mrs. Mettler did not know that the policies had been taken out in her name.
The evidence further tended to show that Mrs. Mettler, not hearing anything of her brother for fifteen days after his departure, sent twice to ascertain whether he had arrived, but found that he had not; a searching party then went out; this party followed the trail of the wagon, and found it and hay, provisions, harnesses, etc., abandoned where Hunter had camped near the banks of the Pecos River, some miles distant from Pecos; a bed on the ground, which some one had slept in, cooking utensils, remains of a fire, a skillet in which meat had been fried, some bread, some tomatoes were there; and a gun was leaning against the wagon wheel. One of the horses was lying dead; it had been tied to a mesquite bush with an inch rope, and had struggled to get to the hay, but could not reach it; there were signs of the other horse, which was elsewhere seen wandering about with a rope on its neck. Footprints, identified by Mrs. Mettler as those of her brother, were found lead-

ing to the river, but not returning; two water buckets were near; some of the foot tracks were at the edge of the river; and there were marks of the slipping of one of the feet, and a
broken mesquite root in the bank.'
1 The county clerk of Reeves County, who headed the searching party which left Pecos on the morning of December 27, testified in respect of the abandoned camp thus: "The wagon was standing with the tongue pointing to the southwest and a little down the river. The harness for two horses was found; two wooden water buckets, with a piece of rope tied in the bail; off to the right of the wagon, about twelve feet from the wagon, was a dead horse, tied to a mesquite bush with a rope about twelve feet long. On the right side of the wagon was a pallet made down. The spring seat had been taken off the wagon and turned upside down, and the wagon sheet laid lengthwise. The sheet was a tarpaulin; this was laid on the ground and spread out full length, with one end resting on the wagon seat. One or two heavy cotton comforts were doubled lengthwise and lay with the end on the wagon seat. Lengthwise of the wagon sheet and on top were two comforts spread out full size, and the wagon sheet had been drawn up over the entire bed. To the left of that, about four feet south and away from the edge, was where there had been a little fire, and there was a skillet and lid. The skillet was setting right where the fire had been built, as if in the middle of the fire, and the lid laying against it. The skillet looked like it had been cooked in. Just behind the front wheel of the wagon, leaning against the axle, was a Winchester rifle. In the wagon were two bales of alfalfa hay and some flour, some canned goods, some light bread, and several joints of stove pipe, and I think, may be, a stove in the wagon and a few other such things. The bread had been untied, and there was still some of it in the paper. When I first saw the bed the centre of the bed had the shape of a man in it; looked so much like it we thought there was a man in it until we got right up, and when George Mansfield started to raise the cover up he dropped it, and turned and looked at me, his face as white as anything could be, and I told him to raise it up; that if there was a man in it, it would not hurt him, and he raised the cover up. The appearance of the bed was as I have described it; there was just the shape of a man there, as if a man had lay in bed; the print of him was in bed. I think both buckets had a piece of rope tied in the bail ten or twelve feet long, and on the bottom two or three inches around; the buckets had the prints of water having been in there and dried up, and a little red sand; they were both dry. The dead horse could not reach the wagon; it had been tied to a mesquite bush with an inch rope, and it appeared that the horse had been struggling to get to the hay in the wagon; he had gone out as far as he could with the rope; there was considerable trail beat around where he was trying to get to the wagon where the hay was. The trail was two or three inches deep. There had been other stock about the wagon and camp; there was the sign of another horse there, and we trailed that

FID. MUT. LIFE ASSN. v. METTLER.
Statement of the Case.
There was conflicting evidence as to quicksands in the river; its depth; rapidity; and dangerous character. Two of defendant's witnesses gave testimony tending to show that some time after the alleged death they had seen a person whom they identified as Hunter by photographs.
In the course of the examination of plaintiff the following occurred:
"'Q. State what is the general reputation in the familyyour father, brothers, and sisters-as to the death of your brother, W. A. Hunter.' To which defendant objected because it is incompetent and hearsay; (2) family reputation cannot establish or prove death, especially where it is 1500 miles away; (3) it is competent for no purpose, especially when that reputation has been established since the institution of this cause of action, which objection the court overruled and said: II think the question is one of weight to be given the evidence. It is a question for the jury to say whether or not family belief tends to prove his death.' To which ruling defendant then and there excepted for the reasons stated in the objection, and the witness thereupon testified: ' y father, brothers, and sisters all believe
horse away from the wagon and back to the wagon at about a half a dozen places. I think one bale of hay had been eaten and tramped down; there was a great deal of trash on the back end of the wagon and laying on the ground."
The witness then described the tracing of the tracks of a man "to the edge of the river and back to the wagon;" then later other footprints "going toward the bank of the river at a point higher up." "We followed right up to the edge of the bank and followed that until they went over a little slant; the top of the river bank was a little sloping; these two footprints, last two, were standing right on that slant, left foot a little behind the right. The footprints had been about half facing the river. The left foot seemed to have turned a little and slipped; the print of it was there,' and showed that it had slipped; and just in front and just below where this bank dropped off perpendicular there was a mesquite root that had been broken off and a part of it was sticking out of the ground. We could see none of these tracks were going back and away from the river; we looked to determine whether they did go away from it and we could not see any going away from there."
Mrs. Mettler, being informed of the discovery, went to the camp with this witness, December 29, and she identified the footprints and testified to the same effect.

OCTOBER TERMT, 1901.
Statement of the Case.
my brother to be dead.' Witness further testified, over the same objections made by defendant, which objections were overruled by the court, and then and there excepted to by defendant, 'that the family believed he was drowned in the Pecos River, out in the West, and that this family belief has existed ever since I wrote them about it.' The witness was here handed a letter, which she recognized as written by herself and addressed to her father, dated December 30, 1896. 'I think I wrote it the day I came back from the camp, from where we found my brother's camping outfit.' ' I reported that my brother was dead. I know he wrote to and received some letters from the family. The very best relations existed between my father and brother. Never was any disagreement between them. The very closest of friendship existed between my brother and me; brotherly and sisterly love.'"
Plaintiff introduced the depositions of W. A. Hunter, Sr., the father of the insured; Charles E. Hunter, his brother; and five sisters, all residing in Homer, Ohio. The father testified that plaintiff and W. A. Hunter, Jr., lived at Homer until they went to Texas in 1885 ; that a family correspondence had been kept up with both of them regularly until the fall of 1896, when he disappeared, and was still kept up with her; that the family relationship was happy and affectionate; that his son's habits were good, and that he possessed the confidence of his family and of his friends ; that he "seemed thoroughly contented with life, and I know of no reason to cause any change in his disposition. I could not tell exactly when any member of the family at Homer last received a letter from said William A. Hunter, Jr., but a short time before his disappearance. I last heard of him through Jennie Al. Mettler, about the time he disappeared, and he.was living at Mentone, Texas, I believe."
The following question was propounded to the witness, W. A. Hunter, Sr., and to the other members of the family:
"Q. If you know, state what is the general reputation and repute in the family as to whether said William A. Hunter is dead or alive? H-ow do you know the general repute in the family as to whether he is dead or alive? If you know, what

FID. MUT. LIFE ASSN. v. METTLER.
Statement of the Case.
is the general repute in the family as to what has become of said William A. Hunter? As to the 'family,' who do you
mean ?" To this question and the answer thereto of each witness, de-
fendant then and there objected, which was overruled, and defendant excepted. The answer was:
"A. That the general repute in the family is that William A.' Hunter, Jr., is dead. He is supposed by the family to have drowned in the Pecos River; that is the general belief. By the 'family' is meant the father and the brothers and sisters of William A. Hunter, Jr."
Each of the other witnesses testified in substance as their father, and the same objection was made to their testimony, and the same ruling had and exception preserved. The father testified "in answer to cross interrogatories propounded by defendant, that he never offered any reward or took any steps to find W. A. Hunter, Jr., either dead or alive, after he heard of his disappearance; that he made no inquiry concerning the said W. A. Hunter, Jr., save through his daughter, Mrs. Mettler; that he did not have the Pecos River seined, and made no search either of the river or elsewhere, or any effort to find him or his body. Newark, Licking County, Ohio, is sixteen miles from witness's home. When witness saw the articles published in the Newark Advocate about the disappearance of W. A. Hunter, Jr., he did not go there to see the editor of said paper. The town is not connected by rail with witness's residence. The same facts as to failure to offer reward or to make any search or inquiry for W. A. Hunter, Jr., were elicited by cross interrogatories from Charles E. Hunter, brother of the plaintiff and W. A. Hunter, Jr."
The jury was charged, among other things: "Reputation in his (insured's) family on the part of his father, sisters and brothers of his death is proper evidence for your consideration, but not the opinion of any one."
The policies were stated to be made in consideration of written application of Hunter therefor, and a copy of the application was attached. Hunter therein agreed "that the truthfulness of the statements above made or contained, by whomsoever

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Statement of the Case.
written, is material to the risk, and is the sole basis of the contract with the said association;" "that I will not without the written consent of the president engage in any occupation or employment more hazardous than that above mentioned; and that if any concealment, or untrue statement, or answer be made or contained herein, then the policy of insurance issued hereon and this contract shall be ?so facto null and void, and all moneys paid hereon shall be forfeited to said association." And the applications showed, among other things, that Hunter in answering questions as to his occupation said: "That my present occupation is real estate and farming, prior was bookkeeping."
There was evidence that Hunter had occupied a section of land in Loving County for three years; that he was in the real estate and farming business; that he planted corn, grain, potatoes, and so on; that the farming was experimental, the land requiring irrigation; that he and Mr. Mettler, then deceased, had been connected with an irrigation company and the construction of a ditch; and that he resided at Mentone, Loving County, "where he engaged in the real estate and farming business, and looked after their irrigation business in Loving County." That he was bookkeeping in 1888 and 1889, and two years, deputy clerk, etc. Defendant introduced evidence in reference to forfeitures of Hunter's claims to public lands entered in February, 1897; and the testimony of a photographer that Hunter was in his employ two or three months one summer at Fort Worth, which he thought was in 1896. Defendant's agent who took the application testified that he had known Hunter since 1888, at which time he was keeping books; that Hunter stated when he applied that he was in the real estate business and farming, and that witness had a talk with him about irrigation matters in connection with his farming.
This witness testified for defendant that when Hunter made the application he said : "That he and his brother-in-law had gotten into an irrigation scheme and had bought a good deal of Pecos Valley land and owed a good deal of money on the land, and his brother-in-law had afterwards died, and he thought, if he should happen to die, his sister would lose what they had

Opinion of the Court.
paid. For this reason he thought of taking some insurance, so that she could pay the land out in the event of his death."
The constitutionality of the statute of Texas allowing twelve per cent damages and reasonable attorneys' fees was denied and duly put in issue by defendant.
The verdict was for plaintiff for "$15,000 as principal; $2250 as interest at rate six per cent from December 2d, 1897, to June 2d, 1900; $5175, the same being twelve per cent damages on the amount of $15,000 and interest thereon at six per cent; $2500 as reasonable attorney's fees." Plaintiff remitted the sum of $3375 of said $5175, "leaving $1800 on the item of twelve per cent damages, on the amount of the loss," and judgment was thereupon entered.
The writ of error was allowed directly from this court, and a motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction was made, the consideration of which was postponed to the merits.
XM. John G. Johnson for plaintiff in error.
fr. C. A. Culberson for defendant in error.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE FuLLER delivered the opinion of the court.
Inasmuch as the validity of the statute of Texas authorizing the recovery of damages and attorneys' fees for failure by life and health insurance companies to pay losses was seasonably drawn in question by defendant below as being in contravention of the Constitution of the United States, we think the case comes within Zoeb v. Columbia Township Yrustees, 179 U. S. 472; American Sugar .Refting Company v. lNew Orleans,181 U. S. 277, and that the writ of error may be maintained. The motion to dismiss is, therefore, overruled.
Four propositions are relied on as grounds of reversal, which we will consider in the reverse order in which they are stated in the brief for plaintiff in error.
I. "The court erred in not charging the jury to find a verdict in favor of the defendant because of the failure to offer sufficient evidence from which an inference of Hunter's death could be drawn."

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.
In our opinion the evidence was sufficient to justify the inference that Hunter was drowned in the Pecos River, on December 1,1896, and the court below properly refused to peremptorily instruct the jury to find for defendant.
The question of Hunter's death was a question of fact to be determined on all relevant facts and circumstances disclosed by the evidence. The evidence tended to show that he was last seen alive on December 3d, when he parted from his sister and started for Ientone, with the intention of returning in a few days. He did not arrive, nor return, but disappeared. He camped on the banks of the Pecos River; and the abandoned wagon, harnesses and gun, the starved horse, the ashes of the fire, the used cooking utensils, the fragments of food, the bed with its imprint of the sleeper, bore testimony that he cooked, ate, and slept there, and that he went no farther. The footsteps to the river's brink, going but not returning, the water buckets, the mark of slipping, the fractured root, the flowing stream, indicated what might have happened, and the fact that he was not seen nor heard from thereafter, although his relations with his family were intimate and cordial, and he had always kept up a correspondence with them, so that one or more of them would have been likely to hear from him unless his life had abruptly terminated or its habitual course been suddenly changed, rendered the inference of fatal accident reasonable.
The record does not set forth the general charge of the court in full, but, among others, this instruction was given: "While death may be presumed from the absence, for seven years, of one not heard from, where news from him, if living, would probably have been had, yet this period of seven years during which the presumption of continued life runs, and at the end of which it is presumed that life ceases, may be shortened by proof of such facts and circumstances connected with the disappearance of the person whose life is the subject of inquir.y, and circumstances connected with his habits and customs of life, as, submitted to the test of reason and experience, would show to your satisfaction by a preponderance of the evidence that the person was dead."
Defendant excepted to the giving of this instruction, and

FID. MUT. LIFE ASSN. v. METTLER.
Opinion of the Court.
requested the court to instruct that "the circumstances proven must exclude, to a reasonable and moral certainty, the fact that such person is still living, and each fact in the chain of facts from which the death of the party is to be inferred must be proved by competent evidence and by the same weight and force of evidence as if each one were the main fact-in issue, and all the facts proven must be consistent with each other and consistent with the main facts in issue, that is, the death of the party."
The court did not err in giving the one and refusing the other instruction. This was not a criminal case, and it was not necessary that the death should be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The party on whose side the weight of evidence preponderated was entitled to the verdict. Proof to a "moral certainty" is an equivalent phrase with "beyond a reasonable doubt." Gray, C. J., Commonwealth v. Costley, 118 Mass. 1. In civil cases it is sufficient if the evidence on the whole agrees with and supports the hypothesis that it is adduced to prove, but in criminal cases it must exclude every other hypothesis but that of the guilt of the party. It has been held in some cases that when a criminal act is alleged the rule of reasonable doubt is applicable in establishing that act, but this is not such a case. 1 Greenleaf, Ev. (15th ed.)  13a, note.
The court also instructed the jury as follows: "If from the evidence in this case you should come to the conclusion that Hunter has been continuously absent since December 3, 1896, without being heard from by his relatives and friends, it should have due weight with you in arriving at your verdict." "Absence alone cannot establish the death of Hunter, for the law presumes an individual shown to be alive and in health at the time of his disappearance continues to live. While the death of Hunter is not to be presumed from absence alone, yet it is a circumstance which should be taken into consideration with all the other evidence in the case, and the conclusion of life or death arrived at from all the facts and circumstances, including his continued absence."
To this defendant excepted, and it is now argued that there was error because the court did not call the attention of the

OCTOBER TERMI, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.
jury to defendant's contention that Hunter's continued absence might be attributed to the desire to obtain the insurance money. But it nowhere appears that defendant requested the court to modify the instruction in that particular, and as given it was correct.
The jury were not left to infer death from the mere fact of disappearance, but were specifically told that that was not in itself sufficient, and that all the facts and circumstances must be considered.
Defendant asked the court to give this instruction: "If you believe from the evidence that William A. Hunter, Jr., has been seen or heard from by any one at any time since his disappearance, you will find for the defendant." This the court refused, and gave the following instruction: "The evidence of witnesses is also before you tending to show that William A. Hunter has been seen on two occasions and at two places since the date of his alleged disappearance on December 4, 1896. You should carefully consider this evidence in relation to his having been seen since the date of his alleged disappearance, and if you believe from the evidence that he was seen by the witnesses who have testified to this, then, of course, it would be your duty to find for the defendant."
There was some evidence that Hunter had been seen, but none that he had been otherwise heard from. The request of defendant was rightly rejected, and the instruction given was sufficient. The criticism that the jury may have supposed that they were instructed that they must be satisfied that he had been seen by both witnesses, or on two occasions, is without merit. It was impossible to have misunderstood what the learned judge of the Circuit Court intended. If, as matter of fact, Hunter was seen alive, whether once or twice, then, of course he did not die as contended by plaintiff.
It is further argued that the court erred in not instructing the jury as requested by defendant, that "unless the jury believe from the evidence that William A. Hunter, Jr., when last seen was in a position of peril, such as that it is more probable that he then and there lost his life than that he extricated himself from such perilous position alive, you must find for the defendant."

FID. MUT. LIFE ASSN. v. METTLER.
Opinion of the Court.
Such an instruction was uncalled for and calculated to mislead. There was no evidence that Hunter was in a position of peril when last seen. The evidence did, indeed, tend to show that he probably fell into the river, and so came in contact with a specific peril, and there was evidence regarding the depth, the rapidity and the quicksands of the river; but the instruction was objectionable in that it assumed that he was seen in a perilous position of such a character as to afford the basis for speculation as to the probabilities of his extrication.

S. 628, 631, Mr. Justice Harlan said: "If it appears in evidence' that the absent person, within the seven years, encountered some specific peril, or within that period came within the range of some impending or immediate danger, which might reasonably be expected to destroy life, the court or jury may infer that life ceased before the expiration of the seven years."
But it was not thereby ruled that the inference of death might not arise from disappearance under circumstances inconsistent with a continuation of life, even though exposure to some particular peril was not shown, and the evidence indicated that Hunter came within the range of immediate danger.
II. "The court erred in not charging, as requested, that if Hunter at the time of making application for insurance was not a farmer and real estate agent, there could be no recovery."
This relates to the refusal to instruct that "the jury must believe from the evidence that W. A. Hunter, Jr., at the time of making application for insurance to defendant, on which policies of insurance were issued and are herein involved, was at the time he made such application both a farmer and real estate agent, and unless you so believe, you will find for the defendant."
The entire charge of the court is not in the record, and there is nothing to show that the subject of Hunter's answer as to his occupation was not covered by it. Again, Hunter did not say that he was "a farmer and real estate agent," but that his occupation when he made the application was "real estate and farming," and the evidence of the truthfulness of that statement was so plenary, and the evidence from which to infer the contrary

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.
was so slight, that we think the refusal was justified on that ground.
Treating the statement of occupation as a warranty, the evidence that Hunter was behind in his payments on the land in Loving County, and that forfeitures were entered in February, 1897, and that he may have been engaged with a photographer for two or three months, even in the summer of 1896, did not so impugn the substantial truth and good faith of his answer as to demand an instruction so worded.
III. "The court erred in admitting the testimony of a repute in the family of Hunter, concerning his death, and the manner thereof."
Hunter had parted with his sister and started for Mentone, December 3, with the intention of returning within a week or ten days. "After he had been gone ten days and did not come back and then two weeks and did not come back," his sister sent a man to make inquiry, who reported that Hunter had not been to Mentone. A few days later she sent again, and received a similar reply. The searching party went out, found the abandoned camp, and reported, and Mrs. Mettler then went herself. She described the condition of things at the camp and the brink of the river. This was December 29, and December 30, the day after she returned, she wrote her father in Ohio about it and that her brother was dead, drowned in the Pecos River, and she testified that her father, brothers and sisters, all believed that this was so, because of what she had written; while they testified that this was the belief of the family, based on the information she furnished. If this testimony should not have been admitted it is difficult to see that it could have been so prejudicial as to be fatal to the verdict, for it amounted to nothing more than the assertion of Mrs. Mettler's belief and the acceptance by the family of that belief as their own. In other words, it cannot be supposed that the jury regarded the evidence as tending to establish the fact of death when it purported only to state Mrs. Iettler's belief and the family's concurrence.
Moreover, in the aspect of showing the entertainment of such belief in good faith the evidence was admissible, if it had been

FID. MUT. LIFE ASSN. v. METTLER.
Opinion of the Court.
offered at the proper time. Hunter had suddenly disappeared. Search was made, but was not prosecuted after the discovery of the deserted camp. The father was sharply interrogated as to failure to offer reward, to seine the river, to make "effort to find him, or his body." And so was the brother Charles. The theory of the insurance company was that the disappearance was voluntary, and that the conduct of Mrs. Mettler and the family was consistent with the belief that he was yet alive, and was indicative of a combination to defraud the company. This inference the family were entitled to repel by testifying to their conviction of his death. As to the fact of death, it was mere matter of opinion, but as to their belief it was matter of fact showing innocence of fraud. Reasonable inquiry is frequently a prerequisite to the inference of death from disappearance, as well as other effort, but no inquiry or effort was made here after discovery of the camp, because the belief of death and lapse of time rendered it useless. Whether that belief was well founded was for the jury, but that there was such belief was a relevant fact. Xew York Life Insurance Company v. l1illmon, 145 U. S. 285, 296; lWallace v. United States, 162 U. S. 477.
But we do not think the evidence was competent to establish the fact of death, under the circumstances of the case. To illustrate: In Scott v. Ratle, 5 Pet. 81, it was held that the testimony of a witness that "she was told that Mr. Madison was dead," was admissible; and in Secrist v. Green, 3 Wall. 744, 751, it was said that "it is competent to prove death and heirship by reputation." But these and similar rulings and expressions in other cases must be taken in connection with the particular facts and circumstances. In this case no question of pedigree; of birth, marriage, or death as bearing on legitimacy, descent, or relationship; of ancient rights; of past events prior to controversy, was involved; nor was there any pretence that this was evidence of tradition, or historical fact, or general reputation in the community participated in by the family. If evidence of death it would be evidence of the particular fact on which recovery was sought, and inadmissible as such. The ruling was incorrect that: "It is a question for the jury to say
VOL. CLXXXv-21

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.
whether or not family belief tends to prove his death," although that was qualified by the learned judge charging the jury: "Reputation in his (insured's) family on the part of his father, sisters, and brothers of his death is proper evidence for your consideration, but not the opinion of any one." But, the entire record considered, we are of opinion that it cannot be presuined that the evidence affected the verdict injuriously to defendant, if at all, and, on the contrary, that it aflirmatively appears that if it could have had any influence whatever, it was solely from the point of view, which rendered it admissible.
IV. "The statute of Texas, which directs that life and health insurance companies, who shall default in payment of their policies, shall pay twelve per cent damages, together with reasonable attorney's fees, is in violation of the Constitution of the United States."
The statute referred to is article 3071 of the Revised Statutes of Texas of 1895, which reads as follows: "In all cases where a loss occurs and the life or health insurance cornpany liable therefor shall fail to pay the same within the time specified in the policy, after demand made therefor, such company shall be liable to pay the holder of such policy, in addition to the amount of the loss, twelve per cent damages on the amount of such loss, together with all reasonable attorney's fees for the prosecution and collection of such loss."
Article 3072 provided that if any life or health insurance company failed to pay off and satisfy any execution issued on final judgment against it within thirty days of demand of payment, the commissioner of insurance should declare the company's certificate of authority to do business null and void.
These articles were sections of chapter three of Title LVIII, "Insurance," and had been brought forward from the Revised Statutes of 1879, arts. 2953, 2954, chapter three, Title LIII, "Insurance." And the same provisions as to foreign life insurance companies and those incorporated outside of the State of Texas were contained in the first general insurance statute of Texas, which was passed on May 2, 1874. 2 Paschal's Dig. art. 7116 o.
Under this title no insurance company was permitted to do

Opinion of the Court.

business in Texas without first obtaining a permit from the commissioner of insurance, and compliance with the law was required before permission could be granted, while by the terms of article 3060 the commissioner was required to revoke the certificate of authority to do business in the State in case any company failed for thirty days to pay any execution issued against it on any valid judgment.
The provisions of chapter three embodied many conditions on which business was permitted to be done. By article 3061 it was made unlawful for any person to act within the State as agent or otherwise for any insurance company for soliciting business unless the company had procured authority to do it from the commissioner. Article 3062 provided that any life or health insurance company desiring to do business in the State should furnish a sworn statement to the commissioner as prescribed, which by article 3063 was to be accompanied by a copy of its charter or the law creating it. Article 3064 required the company to designate an agent or attorney in fact on whom service might be had in case of suit, and article 3065 declared that no life or health insurance company incorporated in Texas or any other State should transact business in Texas with less capital than $100,000 actually invested. Article 3066 required insurance companies of other States to make such deposit in Texas as the laws of their home State required of Texas companies doing business there, and article 3067 provided that all foreign companies should deposit $100,000 with the state treasurer before doing business in Texas; which deposit, by article 3068, was to be applied to the payment of judgments in favor of policyholders; but article 3069 provided that it should be sufficient if the deposit required by section 3066 was made in any other State. Article 3070 provided that suits might be brought in any county where loss occurred or where the policyholder
resided. By article 3073 it was made unlawful for any life or health
insurance company to take any kind of risks or issue any policies of insurance except those of life or health, and the business of life and health insurance in the State was forbidden to be "in any wise conducted or transacted by any company, which

OCTOBER TERAM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.
in this or any other State or country, is engaged or concerned in the business of marine, fire, inland or other insurance."
Articles 3074, 3075, 3076, 3077, 3078, 3079, 3080, 3083, 3084 related to marine, fire or inland insurance companies.
Articles 3081, 3082, 3086, 3087, 3089 applied to insurance
companies generally. Article 3092 read: "The provisions of this chapter shall in
nowise apply to mutual benefit organizations doing business in this State through lodges or councils, such as the order of chosen friends, knights of honor, or kindred organizations." Article 3096 read "Nothing in this title shall be construed to affect or in any way apply to mutual relief associations organized and chartered under the general incorporation laws of
Texas, or which are organized under the laws of any other State, which have no capital stock, and whose relief funds are created and sustained by assessment made upon the members of said associations in accordance with their several by-laws and regulations;" but an annual statement under oath to the department of insurance was required, and the article concluded: "And should any such benevolent organization refuse or neglect to make an annual report as above required, it shall be deemed an insurance company conducted for profit to its officers and amenable to the laws governing such companies."
Article 3092 was taken from an act of April 3, 1889, entitled "An act to provide for the admission from other States of companies or associations carrying on the business of life or casualty insurance on the assessment or natural premium plan," and certain conditions were affixed to their right to do business in the State, which should not apply to mutual benefit organizations doing business through lodges or councils. Laws, 1889, p. 98.
Article 3096 was taken from an act of March 28, 1885, which amended chapter three, Title LIII of the Revised Statutes of 1879, by adding an article thereto couched in similar terms. Laws, 1885, p. 629.
In the revision of 1895 these two laws were assigned to their appropriate place under the title of insurance. Such were the conditions which for many years had been imposed on life in-

FID. MUT. LIFE ASSN. v. METTLER.
Opinion of the Court.
surance companies doing business in Texas when the policy sued on in this case was issued. But it is now contended that article 3071 is in conflict with the Constitution of the United States, in that it denies the equal protection of the laws, because the same conditions are not imposed on fire, marine and inland insurance companies; and on mutual benefit and relief organizations doing business through lodges and mutual relief benevolent associations, more particularly the latter.
In other words, the contention is that the classification is so arbitrary, so destitute of reasonable basis, as to be obnoxious to constitutional objection.
In Union Central Life Insurance Company v. Cowwing, 86 Texas, 654, the Supreme Court of Texas held that the statute in providing for the recovery of damages and attorney's fees was not in violation of the Constitution of Texas or of the United States, and was a valid law. This decision was rendered in May, 1894, but section 2953 of the Revised Statutes of 1879 was the same as section 3071 of the Revised Statutes of 1895, and the acts of March 2S, 1885, and April 3, 1889, were in force, which were subsequently brought forward as sections 3092 and 3096. The Supreme Court held that as all corporations embraced in the classes named were affected alike by the provision, it did not deny the equal protection of the laws; and the court said that the twelve per cent was given as damages for a failure to comply with the contract by payment, and the attorney's fees were allowed as compensation for the costs of collecting the debt. The court was further of opinion that even if the twelve per cent was a penalty for failure to pay when due, there was no provision of the constitution of Texas which forbade such legislation, and that it was for the legislature to determine when the public was so interested in the enforcement of contracts as to justify that enforcement by penalties.
In Fidelity &c. Company v. Allibone, 39 S. W. Rep. 632, this ruling was repeated by the Court of Civil Appeals of Texas, and affirmed by the Supreme Court in Fidelity &c. Company v. Allibone, 90 Tex. 660. Both these courts held that the constitutional question involved was distinguishable from that ruled by this court in Railway Company v. Ellis, 165 U. S. 150.

OCTOBER TERmt, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.
In New York Life Inssrance Company v. Orlopp, 61 S. W. Rep. 336, the same conclusion was reiterated, on the ground that the state legislature had the right to provide the terms on which foreign corporations of that class might do business in the State, and that being a valid exercise of such power and right, the statute formed a part of the contract of every life and health insurance company issued and made in Texas, since the date of its enactment. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in X31erchants' Life Association v. Yoakum, 98 Fed. Rep. 251, held the section to be valid on full discussion.
It is apparent from the various sections of the title relating to insurance, to which we have before referred, that this particular liability amounted to one of the conditions on which life and health insurance companies were permitted to do business in Texas, and the power of the State in the matter of the imposition of conditions on its own and foreign corporations, has been repeatedly recognized by this court. If, however, notwithstanding the acceptance of these conditions, the constitutionality of the particular condition were nevertheless open to question, we must decline to sustain the objection. The reasoning in Bailroad Company v. X[attiews, 174 U. S. 96, applies rather than that in Railway Company v. Ellis. The ground for placing life and health insurance companies in a different class from fire, marine and inland insurance companies is obvious, and we think that putting them in a different class from mutual benefit and relief associations doing business through lodges, and benevolent associations of the character mentioned in the Texas statutes, is not an arbitrary classification, but rests on sufficient reason. The legislature evidently intended to distinguish between life and health insurance companies engaged in business for profit, (and we are not called on to refine as to the distribution of such profits,) and lodges and associations of a mutual benefit or benevolent character, having in mind also the necessity of the prompt payment of the insurance money in very many cases in order to provide the means of living of which the beneficiaries had been deprived by the death of the insured.

opinion of the Court.
Pierce Oil Compoty v. Texas, 177 U. S. 28; New York Life bIsu?'ance company v. Cravens, 178 U. S. 384, are in point and are decisive.
In Insurance Company v. Warren, 181 U. S. 73, a section of the Revised Statutes of Ohio provided in effect that no answer to any interrogatory made by the applicant to the policy should bar the right to recovery or be used in evidence on a trial unless it was clearly proved that such answer was wilfully false and was fraudulently made, that it was material, and induced the company to issue the policy, and that but for such answer the policy would not have been used; and, moreover, that the agent of the company had no knowledge of the falsity or fraud of such answer; and this provision was only applicable to life insurance companies. The constitutionality of that act was upheld by the Supreme Court of Ohio, and this court affirmed its judgment, and in the opinion the language used in WatersPierce Oil Company v. Texas was quoted: "A corporation is the creature of the law, and none of its powers are original. They are precisely what the incorporating act has made them, and can only be exerted in the manner which that act authorizes. In other words, the State prescribes the purposes of a corporation and the means of executing those purposes. The purposes and means are within the State's control. This is true as to domestic corporations. It has even a broader meaning to foreign corporations." And we added: "It was for the legislature of Ohio to define the public policy of that State in respect of life insurance, and to impose such conditions on the transaction of business by life insurance companies within the State as was deemed best. We do not perceive any arbitrary classification or unlawful discrimination in this legislation, but, at all events, we cannot say that the Federal Constitution has been violated in the exercise in this regard by the State of its undoubted power over corporations."
Our conclusion is that the record shows no reversible error, and the judgment is, therefore,
Aftirmed.

JUSTICES HARLAN and BROW,, dissenting.
MR. TUSTICE HARLAN (with whom concurred MR. JUSTICE
B.RowN) dissenting.
I cannot assent to that part of the opinion of the court relating to the constitutionality of the statute of Texas of 1895 which provides that a life or health insurance company, failing to pay a loss within the time specified in the policy, after demand therefor, shall be liable, in addition to the amount of the loss, to pay the holder of the policy "twelve per cent damages on the amount of such loss, together with all reasonable attorney's fees for the prosecution and collection of such loss."
The operation of the statute is well illustrated in the present case; for, the verdict of the jury was for $15,000 as principal, $2250 as interest, $5175 as twelve per cent damages, (of which the plaintiff remitted $3375), and $2500 as special attorney's fees for the plaintiff.
The rule embodied in the statute is not made applicable to fire or marine insurance companies, or to any other companies or corporations doing business in Texas. Does not the State by that statute deny to life and health insurance companies, doing business within its limits, the equal protection of the laws which is secured by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States?
It seems to ie that this question must be answered in the affirmative if any regard whatever be had to the principles announced in Gulf, Colorado & Santa .F Railway v. Ellis, 165 U. S.150, 153, 154.
In that case we had before us a statute, declaring that any person in Texas having "a valid bonafide claim for personal services rendered or labor done, or for damages, or for overcharges on freight, or claims for stock killed or injured by the train of any railway company, provided that such claim for stock killed or injured shall be presented to the agent of the company nearest to the point where such stock was killed or injured, against any railroad corporation operating a railroad in this State, and the amount of such claim does not exceed $50, may present the same, verified by his affidavit, for payment to such corporation, by filing it with any station agent of such

FID. MUT. LIFE ASSN. v. METTLER.
JUSTICES HARLAN and BROWN, dissenting.
corporation in any county where suit may be instituted for the same, and if, at the expiration of thirty days after such presentation, such claim has not been paid or satisfied, he may immediately institute suit thereon in the proper court; and if he shall finally establish his claim, and obtain judgment for the full amount thereof, as presented for payment to such corporation in such court, or any court to which the suit may have been appealed, he shall be entitled to recover the amount of such claim and all costs of suit, and in addition thereto all reasonable attorney'sfees, provided he has an attorney employed in his case, not to exceed $10, to be assessed and awarded by the court and the jury trying the issue."
That statute being in force, an action was brought to recover $50 for a colt killed by the railway company. There was a judgment against the company for the amount claimed, and a
special attorney's fee of $10 in favor of the plaintiff was added, as required by the above statute.
The contention in that case was that the statute made such an arbitrary discrimination against railroad companies embraced by its provisions as to bring it within the prohibition of the Fourteenth Amendment. That view was sustained. This court said: "It is simply a statute imposing a penalty upon railroad corporations for a failure to pay certain debts. No individuals are thus punished, and no other corporations. The act singles out a certain class of debtors and punishes them, when for like delinquencies it punishes no others. They are not treated as other debtors. They cannot appeal to the courts as other litigants under like conditions and with like protection. If litigation terminates adversely to them they are mulcted in the attorney's fees of the successful plaintiff; if it terminates in their favor, they recover no attorney's fees. It is no sufficient answer to say that they are punished only when adjudged to be in the wrong. They do not enter the courts upon equal terms. They must pay attorney's fees if wrong; they do not recover any if right; while their adversaries recover if right and pay nothing if wrong. In the suits, therefore, to which they are parties they are discriminated against, and are not treated as others. They do not stand equal before the law.

OCTOBER TERMI, 1901.
JUSTICES RARLAx and BRowN, dissenting.
They do not receive its equal protection. All this is obvious from a mere inspection of the statute." Referring to the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution, the court said: "The rights and securities guaranteed to persons by that instrument cannot be disregarded in respect to these artificial entities called corporations any more than they can be in respect to the individuals who are the equitable owners of the property belonging to such corporations. A State has no more power to deny to corporations the equal protection of the laws than it has to individual citizens." Again: "1 Neither can it be sustained as a proper means of enforcing the payment of small debts and preventing any unnecessary litigation in respect to them, because it does not impose the penalty in all cases where the amount in controversy is within the limit named in the statute. Indeed, the statute arbitrarily singles out one class of debtors and punishes it for a failure to perform certain duties-duties which are equally obligatory upon all debtors; a punishment not visited by reason of the failure to comply with any proper police regulations, or for the protection of the laboring classes or to prevent litigation about trifling matters, or in consequence of any special corporate privileges bestowed by the State. Unless the legislature may arbitrarily select one corporation or one class of corporations, one individual or one class of individuals, and visit a penalty upon them which is not imposed upon others guilty of like delinquency, this statute cannot be sustained. But arbitrary selection can never be justified by calling it classification. The equal protection demanded by the Fourteenth Amendment forbids this."
I do not perceive how the present decision can be upheld without disregarding the principles of the Ellis case. If a railroad company sued in Texas upon a claim of less than $50 for killing or injuring stock, cannot be required, when unsuccessful in its defence, to pay a special attorney's fee-no such rule being established in reference to other corporations or individuals, sued for a like amount of money-I cannot understand how life and health insurance companies, alone of all corporations or companies doing business in Texas, can be required to pay special damages and special attorney's fees when unsuccess-

JUSTICES HARLAN and BROWN, dissenting.
ful in defending suits brought against them. The two statutes are alike in this, that the defendant company or corporation, whether a railroad corporation or a life or health insurance company, even if successful in an action brought against it, could not recover special attorney's fees or special damages against its adversary. Thus the defendant company in a suit brought under either statute is not permitted to appear in court upon terms of equality with the party suing it, and is subjected to special burdens not imposed upon other companies or other corporations refusing to pay money demanded of them.
We are informed by the opinion of this court that the courts in Texas have held that the Ellis case was distinguishable from the present case, and we are referred to .rnion Central Life Ins. Co. v. Chowning, 86 Texas, 654; Fidelity and Casualty Company v. Allibone, 39 S. W. Rep. 632, affirmed in Fidelity &c. Company v. Allibone, 90 Tex. 660, and Yew York Life Ins. Co. v. Orlop, 61 S. W. Rep. 336. The first named of those cases was decided more than two years before the Ellis case was determined by this court. The first case in Texas in which the Ellis case was referred to was that of Fidelity &c. Company v. Allibone. In that case the Court of Civil Appeals of Texas, after referring to certain prior decisions in that State sustaining the constitutionality of the statute here in question, said: "A late decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, Railway Co. v. Ellis, construing a somewhat analogous statute of this State, and reversing the decision of our Supreme Court approving its validity, may be at variance with the cases just cited; but, until it is expressly so held either by our own Supreme Court or that of the United States, we will adhere to the decisions already made." The judgment in the last case was affirmed, the Supreme Court of Texas observing nothing more than that the case was "distinguishable" from the Ellis case. Upon what grounds the two cases were distinguishable was not stated. It is a very convenient mode for distinguishing two cases, apparently in conflict, to say nothing more than that they are distinguishable. In Nfew York Life Ins. Co. v. Orlopp, the statute was sustained upon the ground that the State could prescribe the terms on which foreign insurance companies might do business within its limits.

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
JrSTIoEs HARLAN and BROWN, dissenting.
This court says that the particular liability imposed by the statute in question "amounted to one of the conditions on which life and health insurance companies were permitted to do business in Texas, and the power of the State in the matter of the imposition of conditions of its own and foreign corporations has been repeatedly recognized by this court."
Of course, speaking generally, a State may impose conditions on its own and foreign corporations. But will any one say, or has this court ever directly held, that a provision of a state enactment relating to corporations, foreign or domestic, was legally operative or binding if such provision be inconsistent with the Constitution of the United States?
It is one thing for a State to forbid a particular foreign corporation, or a particular class of foreign corporations, from doing business at all within its limits. It is quite another thing for a State to admit or license foreign corporations to do business within its limits and then subject them to some statutory provision that is repugnant to the Constitution of the United States. If a corporation, doing business in Texas under its license or with its consent, insists that a particular statute or regulation is in violation of the Constitution of the United States, and cannot therefore be enforced against it, the State need only reply-such seems to be the logical result of the present decision-that the statute or regulation is a condition of the right of the corporation to do business in the State, and, whether constitutional or not, must be respected by the corporation. Corporations created by the several States are necessary to the conduct of the business of the country; and it is a startling proposition that a State may permit a corporation to do business within its limits, and by that act acquire the right to subject the corporation to regulations that may be inconsistent with the supreme law of the land.
In Insurance Coml)any v. _Morse, 20 Wall. 445, 455, 456, a statute of Wisconsin, requiring insurance companies of other States to stipulate, as a condition of their right to do business in that State, that they would not remove into the Federal court any suit brought against them in the state courts, was held invalid not only because it tended to oust the courts of the

FID. MUT. LIFE ASSN. v. METTLER.
JUSTICES HARLAN and BROWN, dissenting.
United States of a jurisdiction conferred upon them by the Constitution, but because it created an obstruction to the exercise of a right granted by that instrument. The court said: "Every citizen is entitled to resort to all the courts of the country, and to invoke the protection which all the laws or all those courts may afford." The court further said that the right of the insurance company to remove the suit was "denied to it by the state court on the ground that it had made the agreement referred to, and that the statute of the State authorized and required the making of the agreement. We are not able to distinguish this agreement and this requisition, on principle, from a similar one made in the case of an individual citizen of New York. A corporation has the same right to the protection of the laws as a natural citizen, and the same right to appeal to all the courts of the country. The rights of an individual are not superior, in this respect, to that of a corporation. The State of Wisconsin can regulate its own corporations and the affairs of its own citizens, in subordination, however, to the Constitution of the United States. The requirement of an agreement like this from their own corporations would be brutumfulmen, because they possess no such right under the Constitution of the United States. A foreign citizen, whether natural or corporate, in this respect possesses a right not pertaining to one of her own citizens. There must necessarily be a difference between the statutes of the two in this respect."
This question was presented in somewhat different form in W. TV. Cargill Co. v. .innesota, 180 U. S. 452, 468. That was an action by the State to prevent a Wisconsin corporation from operating a warehouse owned by it until it should have obtained a license from the Railroad and Warehouse Commission of Minnesota organized under a statute of that State, and relating to elevators and warehouses. That statute provided: "It shall be unlawful to receive, ship, store or handle any grain in any such elevator or warehouse, unless the owner or owners thereof shall have procured a license therefor from the state Railroad and Warehouse Commission, which license shall be issued for the fee of one dollar per year, and only upon written application under oath, specifying the location of such elevator or

JUSTICES HARLAN and BRoWN, dissenting.
warehouse and the name of the person, firm or corporation owning and operating such elevator or warehouse, and the names of all the members of the firm or the names of all the officers of the corporation owning and operating such elevator or warehouse, and all moneys received for such licenses shall be turned over to the state grain inspection fund. Such license shall confer upon the licensee full authority to operate such warehouse or elevator in accordance with the laws of this State and the rules and regulations prescribed by said Commission, and every person, company or corporation receiving such license shall be held to have accepted the provisions of this act, and thereby to have agreed to have complied with the same."
The Wisconsin corporation defended the suit brought against it upon the ground that the 9tatute there involved was repugnant to the Constitution of the United States. This court said: "We cannot question the power of the State, so far as the Constitution of the United States is concerned, to require a license for the privilege of carrying on business of that character within its limits-such a license not being required for the purpose of forbidding a business lawful or harmless in itself, but only for purposes of regulation." Again-and this is most pertinent here-the court said: "The defendant however insists that some of the provisions of the statute are in violation of the Constitution of the United States, and if it obtained the required license, it would be held to have accepted all of its provisions, and (in the words of the statute) 'thereby to have agreed to comply with the same.' The answer to this suggestion is that the acceptance of a license, in whatever form, will not impose upon the licensee an obligation to respect or comply with any provisions of the statute or with any regulations prescribed by the state Railroad and Warehouse Commission that are repugnant to the Constitution of the United States. A license will give the defendant full authority to carry on its business in accordance with the valid laws of the State and the valid rules and regulations prescribed by the Commission. If the Commission refused to grant a license, or if it sought to revoke one granted, because the applicant in the one case, or the licensee in the other, refused to comply with statutory provisions or

with rules or regulations inconsistent with the Constitution of the United States, the rights of the applicant or the licensee could be protected and enforced by appropriate judicial proceedings."
In the case before us, the defendant company was doing business in Texas under a license issued by the State. By accepting such license, the company did not agree to submit to any local regulation that was repugnant to the Constitution of the United States. It could resist the enforcement of any regulation or statutory provision that was inconsistent with rights secured to it by that instrument.
The court says that the ground for placing life and health insurance companies in a different class from fire, marine and inland insurance companies is obvious. The only reason assigned for that statement is "the necessity of the prompt payment of the insurance money in very many cases in order to provide the means of living of which the beneficiaries had been deprived by the death of the insured." But the same reasons exist for prompt payment by a fire insurance company when the house which shelters the insured and his family is destroyed" by fire. And yet, under the statute, a fire, marine or inland insurance company, if it resists a claim for loss, is not liable, when its defence is unsuccessful, to pay any special damages or special attorney's fee. It can defend any suit brought against it under the same conditions accorded to individual citizens or to corporate bodies generally. But a different and most arbitrary rule is prescribed for life and health insurance companies. Their good faith in refusing to pay a claim for loss, or in defending an action brought to enforce payment of such a claim, is not taken into account. If, in any case, they do not, within a specified time, pay the amount demanded of them, no matter what may be the reason for their refusal to pay, and if they do not succeed in their defence, they must pay not only the principal sum, with ordinary interest, but, in addition, twelve per cent damages on the amount of the principal, and all reasonable attorney's fees for the prosecution and collection of the loss. Thus the State, in effect, forbids a life or health insurance company to appear in a court of justice and defend a suit brought

Statement of the Case.
aoainst it, except subject to the harsh condition that if the jury does not sustain the defence, the company must pay special damages and special attorney's fees that are not exacted from any other defendant, corporate or individual, who may be sued for money.
This is such an arbitrary classification of corporations and such a discrimination against life and health insurance coinpanies as brings the statute within the decision in the Elliscase, which has been often referred to by this court with approval. _3fagoun v.

In my opinion, the statute in question comes within the constitutional prohibition of the denial by a State of the equal protection of the laws and should be held void.

No. 590. Submitted March 10, 1902.-Decided May 5, 1902.
In order to warrant the exercise by this court of jurisdiction over the judgments of state courts, there must be some fair ground for asserting the existence of a Federal question, and in the absence thereof a writ of error will be dismissed, although the claim of a Federal question was plainly set up; and where by the record it appears that such a claim, although set up, had no substance or foundation, the fact that it was raised was not sufficient to give this court jurisdiction.
That the State has power to forfeit the charter of a corporation for an abuse of its privileges, is recognized as law in Louisiana.
In Louisiana a corporation is liable to be proceeded against for taking illegal rates by quo warrantoat the suit of the State.
Upon a careful review of all the questions, the court is of opinion that no Federal question exists in this record, and that the court is without jurisdiction in this case.

ORR v. GILMAN.
ERROR TO THE SURROGATE'S COURT OF THE COUNTY-OF NEW YORP.
No. 351. Argued November 25, 26, 1901.-Decided January 6,1902.
The provisions of subdivision 5 of the tax law of the State of New York, which became a law April 16, 1897, are not in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, nor of section 10 of article 1 of the Constitution.
The opinion in Carpenterv. Pennsylvania,17 How. 456, although decided before the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, correctly defines the limits of jurisdiction between the State and the Federal governments, in respect to the control of the estates of decedents, both as they were regarded before the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, and have since been regarded.
The holding of the Court of Appeals of New York, that it was the execution of the power of appointment which subjected grantees under it to the transfer tax, is binding upon this court.
The Court of Appeals did not err when it held that a transfer or succession tax, not being a direct tax upon property, but a charge upon a privilege, exercised or enjoyed under the laws of the State, does not, when imposed in cases where the property passing consists of securities exempt by statute, impair the obligation of a contract within the meaning of the Constitution of the United States.
The view of the Court of Appeals in this case must be accepted by this court as an accurate statement of the law of the State.
- DAvD Dows, Senior, a citizen and resident of the city and State of New York, died March 30, 1890, leaving a last will and testament, which was duly admitted to probate by the Surrogate's Court of New York County on April 14, 1890. The will provided that the legal title to the property mentioned and described in the sixth clause thereof should vest in the executors' names as trustees during the lifetime of testator's son, David Dows, Jr., with power to manage and control the same, and with the duty to pay the net income therefrom to said David Dows, Jr. The will further provided that upon the death of David Dows, Jr., the property should vest absolutely and at once in such of his children him surviving, and the issue of his deceased children as he should by his last will

and testament designate and appoint, and in such manner and upon such terms as he might legally impose. In and by the eighth clause or paragraph of his said will, David Dows, Senior, devised and bequeathed the legal title to his residuary estate to his executors as trustees, to hold and manage the same, one eighth part in trust during the lifetime of testator's widow, and one-eighth part in trust for each of testator's seven children-one of whom was the said David Dows, Jr. It was made the duty of the trustees to pay over the net income to the respective persons named during their respective lives, and it was provided that, upon the death of each of said persons, the said one eighth part of the residuary estate, with any accumulations'and profits, should vest absolutely and at once in such of his or her children, or the issue of such children, as he or she might by his or her last will and testament designate and appoint, and in such manner and upon such terms as he or she may legally impose. It was provided, in both the sixth and eighth clauses, that if the legatee for life shall die intestate, then the property should vest absolutely and at once in his or her children surviving, share and share alike.
David Dows, Junior, died January 13, 1899, leaving a last will and testament, which was duly admitted to probate bythe Surrogate's Court of Westchester County, New York, by the third paragraph or clause whereof, in the exercise of the power of appointment given him in his father's will, he provided that the property mentioned and described in the said sixth and eighth clauses of the will of David Dows, Senior, should vest upon his death in his three children, David, Robert and Kemeth, in a manner therein described.
On October 31, 1900, Bird S. Coler, Comptroller of the city of New York, and Theodore P. Gilman, Comptroller of the State of New York, filed a petition in the Surrogate's Court of New York County, in which, after reciting the foregoing facts, they alleged that the transfer of funds and property of which David Dows, Junior, bad the life use and over which he had exercised the power of appointment given him in his father's will, was taxable, and they therefore prayed for the appointment of a transfer tax appraiser, in order that the transfer tax

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Statement of the Case.
might be duly assessed and imposed. Thereupon Charles K. Lexow was so appointed, and on January 31,1901, after having given notice to the said Comptrollers and to the executors and trustees of the last will of David Dows, Senior, and to the executors of the last will of David Dows, Junior, and to the guardians of the minor children of David Dows, Junior, the appraiser filed in the Surrogate's office a report of his valuation of the interests of the three sons of David Dows, Junior, under the respective wills of their father and grandfather. Certain exceptions to this report were filed on behalf of the executors and guardians, the nature of which will hereafter appear. Thereafter, on February 15, 1901, the Surrogate, on the basis of the report of the said appraiser, assessed a transfer tax of upwards of $7000 against each of the respective interests of the three sons of David Dows, Junior. The exceptions to the appraiser's report and to the assessment were, on March 6, 1901, after argument by counsel, overruled, and the Surrogate entered the following order and judgment:
"It is ordered, adjudged and decreed that said report and order so appealed from be and they are hereby affirmed, and that the date when the transfers now taxed were affected was January 13, 1899, that date being fixed because it was the date of the death of David Dows, Junior, the donee of the power contained in the will of David Dows, Senior."
An appeal was taken from the order and decree of the Surrogate to the appellate division of the Supreme Court of New York, and by that court, on March 22, 1901, the order of the Surrogate was affirmed. On appeal duly taken, the Court of Appeals of the State of New York, on May 17, 1901, affirmed the order and judgment of the appellate division of the Supreme Court, and the judgment of the said Court of Appeals and the record of the proceedings were remitted into the Surrogate's Court of New York, to be enforced according to law, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals was on May 28, 1901, made the judgment and order of the Surrogate's Court. And on June 13, 1901, a writ of error to that judgment was allowed, and the cause was brought to this court.

Mr. Jabish Holmes, r., for defendants in error. .r'. Edgar J -Levey was on his brief.
MR. JUSTIOE SmR~s delivered the opinion of the court.
This is the case of a so-called transfer tax imposed under the laws of the State of New York. The various contentions of the plaintiffs in error, attacking the validity of the tax, were overruled by the courts of the State, and the cause is now before us on the general proposition that by the proceedings the plaintiffs in error, or those whom they represent as trustees and guardians, have been deprived of the equal protection of the laws of the State of New York, their privileges and immunities as citizens of the United States have been abridged, and their property taken without due process of law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and likewise, as to a portion of the property affected, in violation of section 10 of article I of the Constitution of the United States.
The first question presented arises out of subdivision 5 of section 220 of the tax law of the State of New York, which reads as follows:
"5. Whenever any person, or corpbration, shall exercise a power of appointment, derived from any disposition of property, made either before or after the passage of this act, such appointment, when made, shall be deemed a transfer, taxable, under the provisions of this act, in the same manner as though the property, to which such appointment relates, belonged absolutely to the donee of such power, and had been bequeathed, or devised, by such donee by will; and whenever any person, or corporation, possessing such a power of appointment, so derived, shall omit, or fail, to exercise the same within the time provided therefor, in whole or in part, a transfer, taxable under the provisions of this act, shall be deemed to take place to the extent of such omissions, or failure, in the same manner as

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.
though the persons, or corporations, thereby becoming entitled to the possessions, or enjoyment of the property to which such power related, had succeeded thereto, by a will of the donee, of the power failing to exercise such power, taking effect at the time of such omission, or failure."
This enactment became a law on April 16, 1897. David Dows, Senior, died IMarch 30, 1890, leaving a will containing a power of appointment to his son, David Dows, Junior, which will was duly admitted to probate by the Surrogate's Court on April 14, 1890. David Dows, Junior, died on January 13,1899, leaving a will, in which he exercised the power of appointment given him in the will of his father, and apportioned the pfoperty, which was the subject of the power, among his three sons, who are represented in this litigation by the plaintiff in error.
It is claimed that, under the law of the State of INew York as it stood at the time of his death, in 1890, David Dows, Senior, had a legal right to transfer, by will, his property or any interest therein, to his grandchildren, without any diminution, or impairment, then imposed by the law of the State upon the exercise of that right; that his said grandchildren acquired vested rights in the property so transferred, and that the subsequent law, whose terms have been above transcribed, operates to diminish and impair those vested rights. In other words, it is claimed that it is not competent for the State, by a subsequent enactment, to exact a price or charge for a privilege lawfully exercised in 1890, and to thus take from the grandchildren a portion of the very property the full right to which had vested in them many years before.
We here meet, in the first place, the question of the construction of the will of David Dows, Senior. Under and by virtue of that will, did the property, whose transfer is taxed, pass to and become vested in the grandchildren, or did the property not become vested in them until and by virtue of the will of David Dows, Junior, exercising the power of appointment? The answer to be given to this question must, of course, be that furnished us by the Court of Appeals in this case. atmer of Dows, 167 N. Y. 22?:
".Whatever be the technical source of title of a grantee under

ORR v. GILMAN.
Opinion of the Court.
a power of appointment, it cannot be denied that, in reality and substance, it is the execution of the power that gives the grantee the property passing under it. The will of Dows, Senior, gave his son a power of appointment, to be exercised only in a particular manner, to wit, by last will and testament. If, as said by the Supreme Court of the United States, the right to take property by devise is not an inherent or natural right, but a privilege accorded by the State, which it may tax or charge for, it follows that the request of a testator to make a will or testamentary instrument is equally a privilege and equally subject to the taxing power of the State. When David Dows, Senior, devised this property to the appointees under the will of his son he necessarily subjected it to the charge that the State might impose on the privilege accorded to the son of making a will. That charge is the same in character as if it had been laid on the inheritance of the estate of the son himself, that is, for the privilege of succeeding to property under a will."
It will be perceived that, in putting this construction upon the will of David Dows, Senior, the Court of Appeals not merely construed the words of the will but, by implication, applied to the case the provisions of the subdivision 5 of section 220, under which the transfer tax in question was imposed, and thus construed that tax law and affirmed its validity.
While it is settled law that this court will follow the construction put by the state courts upon wills devising property situated within the State, and while it is also true that we adopt the construction of its own statutes by the state courts, a question may remain whether the statute, as so construed, imports a violation of any of the rights secured by applicable provisions of the Constitution of the United States. And such is the contention here.
This court has no authority to revise the statutes of New York upon any grounds of justice, policy or consistency to its own constitution. Such questions are concluded by the decision of the legislative and judicial authorities of the State.
In Carpenter v. Pennsylvania,17 Iow. 456, the question arose as to the validity, in its Federal aspect, of a law of the State of Pennsylvania imposing an inheritance tax on personal

Opinion of the Court.
property which had passed into the possession of an executor before the passage of the act, and which was held by him for the purpose of distribution among the legatees, who were collateral relatives to the decedent. The act was held valid by the Supreme Court of the State, and was brought up to this court by a writ of error, where it was contended that such an act was in its nature an ex postfacto law, which took the property of an individual to the use of the State, because of a fact which had occurred prior to the passage of the law, and also that the law, in its retroactive effect, impaired the obligation of a contract, in that it was alleged to absolve the executor from his contract, implied in law, to pay over the legacies to those entitled to them, just to the extent that the law required him to pay to the State. The opinion of the court, delivered by Mr. Justice Campbell, was, in part, as follows:
"The validity of the act, as affecting successions to open after its enactment, is not contested; nor is the authority of the State to levy taxes upon personal property belonging to its citizens, but situated beyond its limits, denied. But the complaint is that the application of the act to a succession already in the course of settlement, and which had been appropriated by the last will of decedent, involved an arbitrary change of the existing laws of inheritance to the extent of this tax, in the sequestration of that amount for the uses of the State; that the rights of the residuary legatees were vested at the death of the testator, and from that time those persons were non-residents, and the property taxed was also beyond the State; and that the State has employed its power over the executor and the property within its borders, to accomplish a measure of wrong and injustice; that the act contains the imposition of a forfeiture or penalty, and is ex postfacto.
"It is, in some sense, true that the rights of donees under a will are vested at the death of the testator; and that the acts of administration which follow are conservatory means, directed by the State to ascertain those rights, and to accomplish an effective translation of the dominion of the decedent to the objects of his bounty; and the legislation adopted with any other aim than this would justify criticism, and perhaps censure.

ORR v. GILMAN.
Opinion of the Court.
But, until the period for distribution arrives, the law of the decedent's domicil attaches to the property, and all other jurisdictions refer to the place of the domicil as that where the distribution should be made. The will of the testator is proven there, and his executor receives his authority to collect the property, by the recognition of the legal tribunals of that place. The personal estate, so far as it has a determinate owner, belongs to the executor thus constituted. The rights of the donee are subordinate to the conditions, formalities and administrative control, prescribed by the State in the interests of its public order, and are only irrevocably established upon its abdication of this control at the period of distribution. If the State, during this period of administration and control by its tribunals and their appointees, thinks fit to impose a tax upon the property, there is no obstacle in the Constitution and laws of the United States to prevent it. Ennis v. Smith, 14 How. 400.
"The act of 1860, in enlarging the operation of the act of 1826, and by extending the language of that act beyond its legal import, is retrospective in its form; but its practical agency is to subject to assessment property liable to taxation, to answer an existing exigency of the State, and to be collected in the course of future administration; and the language retlrospective is of no importance, except to describe the property to be included in the assessment. And as the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has well said, 'in establishing its peculiar interpretation, it (the legislature) has only done indirectly what it was competent to do directly.' But if the act of 1850 involved a change in the law of succession, and could be regarded as a civil regulation for the division of the estates of unmarried persons having no lineal heirs, and not as a fiscal imposition, this court could not pronounce it to be an exp ost facto law within the tenth section of the nineteenth article of the Constitution. The debates in the Federal convention upon the Constitution show that the terms 'expostfacto laws,' were understood in a restricted sense, relating to criminal cases only, and that the description of Blackstone of such laws was referred to for their meaning. 3 Mad. Pap. 1399, 1450, 1579.) This signification was adopted in this court shortly after its organization, in opin-

ions carefully prepared, and has been repeatedly announced since that time. Calder v. Bull,3 Dall. 386; Fletcherv. Peck, 6 Cranch, 87; 8 Pet. 88; 11 Pet. 421."
It is true that this case was decided before the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, but we think it correctly defines the limits of jurisdiction between the state and Federal governments in respect to the control of the estates of decedents, both as they were regarded before and have been regarded since the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment. It has never been held that it was the purpose or function of that amendment to change the systems and policies of the States in regard to the devolution of estates, or to the extent of the taxing power over them.
In n re emmler, 136 U. S. 436, it was stated by the present Chief Justice that-
"The Fourteenth Amendment did not radically change the whole theory of the relations of the state and Federal governments to each other, and of both governments to the people. The same person may be at the same time a citizen of the United States and a citizen of a State. Protection to life, liberty, and property rests primarily with the States, and the amendment furnishes an additional guaranty against any encroachment by the States upon those fundamental rights which belong to citizenship, and which the state governments were created to secure. The privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, as distinguished from the privileges and immunities of citizens of the States, are indeed protected by it; but those are privileges and immunities arising out of the nature and essential character of the national government, and granted or secured by the Constitution of the United States. United States v. Cruikshank,92 U. S.542; SlaughterHouses Cases,16 Wall. 36."
It was said in De -Vaughnv. Hutchinson, 165 U. S.566, that "It is a principle firmly established that to the law of the State in which the land is situated we must look for the rules which govern its descent, alienation and transfer, and for the effect and construction of wills and other conveyances."
In Clarke v. Olarke, 178 U. S.186,- the proposition was again announced, as one requiring only to be stated, that the law of

ORR v. GILMAN.
Opinion of the Court.
a State in which land is situated controls and governs its transmission by will or its passage in case of intestacy, and that in this court the local law of a State is the law of that State as announced by its court of last resort.
In .]agoun v. Illinois T rust Co., 170 U. S. 283, the validity of a law of the State of Illinois imposing a legacy and inheritance tax, the rate progressing by the amount of the beneficial interest acquired, was assailed in the courts of Illinois as being in violation of the constitution of that State, requiring equal and uniform taxation. The state court having decided that the progressive feature did not violate the constitution of that State, the case came to this court upon the contention that the establishment of a progressive rate was a denial both of due process of law and of the equal protection of the laws within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. But these contentions were held by this court to be untenable.
See, likewise, KnowZton v. Moore, 178 U. S. 41, and Plummer v. Coler, 178 U. S. 115, wherein were considered the nature of inheritance tax laws and the extent of the powers of the States and of Congress in imposing and regulating them.
In the light of the principles thus established we are unable to see in this legislation of the State of New York, as construed by its highest court, any infringement of the salutary provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment. There are involved no arbitrary or unequal regulations, prescribing different rates of taxation on property or persons in the same condition. The provisions of the law extend alike to all estates that descend or devolve upon the death of those who once owned them. The moneys raised by the taxation are applied to the lawful uses of the State, in which the legatees have the same interests with the other citizens. Nor is it claimed that the amount or rate of the taxation is excessive to the extent of confiscation.
But, it is further urged, that the tax law of the State of New York, section 221, expressly exempts from taxation, or charge, all real estate passing to lineal descendants by descent or devise, and all such descendants so taking title to real estate from ancestors, and it is said that under the interpretation of this law by the courts of the State of New York all property which

OCTOBER TERM, 1901.
Opinion of the Court.
was real estate at the time of the death of the person owning it continues, as to the lineal descendants, to be real estate, and is therefore exempt from taxation, though such descendants may not enter into possession and enjoyment of the property until years after the death of the ancestor who owned it, and the property in the meantime has been converted into cash or securities.
It is true that the property described in the sixth paragraph of the will of David Dows, Senior, was real estate, but under the powers conferred in the will of David Dows, Senior, the trustees had converted the real estate and held the proceeds as personal property before the death of David Dows, Junior, and it was this personal property which became vested in the grandchildren under the exercise of the power of appointment. The Court of Appeals held that it was the execution of the power of appointment which subjected grantees under it to the transfer tax. This conclusion is binding upon this court in so far as it involves a construction of the will and of the statute. Nor are we able to perceive that thereby the plaintiffs in error were deprived of any rights under the Federal Constitution. The rule of law laid down by the New York courts is applicable to all alike, and even if the view of the Court of Appeals respecting the question was wrong, it was an error which we have no power to review.
Another objection made to the judgment of the Court of Appeals, affirming the Surrogate's order, is that the tax imposed upon transfers made under a power of appointment is a tax upon property and not on the right of succession, and that, as a portion of the fund was invested in incorporated companies liable to taxation on their own capital, and in certain bonds of the State of New York, and in bonds of the city of New York exempt by statute from taxation, such exemption formed part of the contract under which said securities were purchased, and the tax imposed and the proceedings to enforce it were in violation of section 10 of article 1 of the Constitution of the United States forbidding the States to pass laws impairing the obligation of contracts.
The Court of Appeals overruled the proposition that the

ORR v. GILMAN.
Opinion of the Court.
transfer tax in question was a tax upon property and not upon the right of succession, and held that when David Dows, Senior, devised this property to the appointees under the will of his son he necessarily subjected it to the charge that the State might impose on the privilege accorded to the son of making a will and that the charge is the same in character as if it had been laid on the inheritance of the estate of the son himself, that is, for the privilege of succeeding to property under a will.
In reaching this conclusion the Court of Appeals cited not only various New York cases but several decisions of this court, the principles of which were thought to be applicable. .kfagoun v. Illinois Trust Co., 1'(0 U. S. 283; Plummer v. Coler, 178 U. S. 115 ; KYnowlton v. _Afoore, 178 U. S. 41; Jurdocek v. Ward, 178 U. S. 139.
We think it unnecessary to enter upon another discussion of a subject so recently considered in the cases just cited, and that it is sufficient to say that, in our opinion, the Court of Appeals did not err when it held that a transfer or succession tax, not being a direct tax upon property, but a charge upon a privilege exercised or enjoyed under the law of the State, does not, when imposed in cases where the property passing consists of securities exempt by statute, impair the obligation of a contract within the meaning of the Constitution of the United States.
A further contention is made that the legatees or devisees of the remainders created by the will of David Dows, Junior, are not legally subject to taxation until the precedent estates terminate and the remainders vest in possession.
The Court of Appeals held that the doctrine invoked had no application to the remainders given to the sons of David Dows, Junior; that they are absolute and not subject to be divested or to fail in any contingency whatever; that by statute they are alienable, devisable, descendible, and if the property were real estate, they could be sold on execution against their owners; that by the aid of the table of annuities, upon the faith of which large sums are constantly distributed by the courts, the present value of these remainders is capable of ready

computation; and that, therefore, they are subject to present taxation.
These views of the Court of Appeals must be accepted by us as accurate statements of the law of the State; and though it is claimed in the brief of counsel for the plaintiffs in error that such a construction of the transfer tax law brings it into conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, we are unable to approve such a contention. The subject dealt with is one of state law, expounded by state courts. The laws and the construction put upon them apply equally to all persons in a like suitation, and cannot be regarded as conflicting with the provisions of the Federal Constitution. Magoun v. Plinois Trust (Co., 170 U. S. 283.
Other contentions made in the brief of counsel for the plaintiffs in error seem, so far as our jurisdiction is concerned, to be phases of those heretofore considered and thereby disposed of.
