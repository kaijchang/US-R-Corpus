TAYLOR v. LEESNITZER.
APPEAL FROM THE 'COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
No. 45. Argued March 8, 1911.-Decided March 20, 1911.
Although generally slow to overrule decigions .of courts other than those of the United States on questions of lbcal practice, this court will do so where, as in this case, the court below yields a consideration -of the merits to form and takes too strict a view of its own -powers.
When an appeal is taken in open court, all parties are present in fact *or in law and have notice; formalities are not needed to indicate that it is taken. against all parties.
The requirement of a bond in the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia does not go to the essence of the appeal, and the form should be objected to. within twenty days; and where the appeal was taken in open court, objections to the form of bond cannot be taken on a motion to dismiss the appeal filed six months after the apoeal was taken based on defects in the appeal.
Although too late for an appeal to be dismissed on account of the form of bond, if the proper parties are before the court, leave can be given to file an additional bond if desired.

THE facts are-stated in the opinion.

decree of the Supreme Court. The bill was brought by the appellee Leesnitzer, as one of the heirs of Thomas Taylor, for a partition between herself and the other heirs of lands acquired by Taylor after the execution of his last will. By the will Taylor left all his estate, both real and personal, to his widow, the appellant. See Bradford v. Matthews, 9 App. D. C. 438. Crenshaw v. McCormick, 19 App. D.C. 438. Code D. C., § 1628. Hardenbergh v. Ray, 151 U. S. 112. The bill, of course, was adverse to the appellant's right under the will, and also prayed that she might be declared barred of her dower. See Clark v. Roller, 199 U. S. 541, 545. After a trial there was a decree for the plaintiff "unless the defendant Margaret E. Taylor shall perfect her appeal from this decree, which is prayed by her in open court and allowed, by giving a supersedeas bond in the penal sum of One Thousand dollars." The decree was filed on May 28, 1907. On June 3, 1907, an appeal bond was filed, but in accordance with the rules, under ordinary conditions, was not printed in the transcript of the record sent to the Court of Appeals. The record was filed in that court on July 17, 1907. On February 12, 1908, the plaintiff Leesnitzer filed a motion that the appeal be dismissed, because 1. Elizabeth E. Padgett, an heir and one of the defendants, ",has not been joined either as an appellee or appellant or as a party hereto. 2. That there has been no summons and severance, or service of notification of appeal upon said Elizabeth E. Padgett. Edmund Burke, solicitor for appellee." This motion was granted, on the ground that Mrs. Padgett was not made a party, to the appeal.,
Thereupon the appellant moved to modify the decree by allowing the appellant to correct her appeal by citing the omitted parties and for such further proceedings as might be necessary to a decision of the cause upon its merits. The court held that as Mrs. Padgett had admitted the allegations of the bill and had arrayed herself.

on the plaintiff's side, and as she had got all that she could expect by the decree, the appellant did not need to obtain a severance, but that the appeal should have been taken against her as well as against the plaintiff and that 'the supersedeas bond should have run to both, which 'an inspection of the bond in the office of the clerk be1.w' showed not to have been the case. It was objected that the court could not look beyond the record before it, Which, as we have indicated, contained onlk a memorandum that a b6nd had been filed. But the record was entitled 'Margaret E. Taylor etc. v. Mary J.. Leesnitzer' until within a few days before the case wasc'alled for hearing, when the appellant ex parte caused the cover of the printed record to be changed so as to name also Elizabeth E. Padgett and 'Franklin Padgett as appellees. It was said that if the court should confine itself to the record the presumption was that the title of the appeal followed the obligation of the bond.:- On this ground the court, with expiessions of regret, considered itself not at liberty to entertain a motion for leave to file an additional bond.
We generally are slow to overrule the decisions of courts other than courts of the United States upon matters of l5cal' practice. But as the Court of Appeals unwillingly yielded a consideration of the merits to what in the circumstances probably was little more -than form, we feel less hesitation than otherwise we might in acting upon our opinion that it took too strict a view of its own powers. :The first decision went on the ground that Mrs. Padgett was not made a party to the appeal, and, if we correctly understand the second, it also seems to have stood, on the same -notion deduced as a conclusion from the form of the bond, as disclosed by inspection or :.presumed. No other was open under the motion except one discarded by the court as We have shown, and no other was or was likely to be taken by the Court of Appeals. But this ground cannot be taken on the record,

TAYLOR v. LEESNITZER.

220 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

because the decree, in the Supreme Court states that an appeal was prayed in open court.
When an appeal is taken in open court it does not need the formalities of ancient law to indicate that it is taken against all adverse interests. All parties are present in fact or in law, and they have notice then and there. No citation is required. Chicago & Pacific R. R. Co. v. Blair, 100 U. S. 66L Brockett v. Brockett, 2 How. 238. The requirement of a bond by a rule of the Court of Appeals does not go to the essence of the appeal, as is shown by the condition in the rule that the motion to dismiss for want of one must be "made within the first twenty days next after the receipt of the transcript in this Court." Rule X. As the parties in this case had notice of the appeal, they were put upon inquiry as to the scope of the bond, and if, as the Court of Appeals says, there is a presumption that the title of the transcript follows the obligation of the bond, they had actual notice of its form. But the bond cannot create a retrospective presumption as to the effect of the words spoken in open court on the scope of the appeal. That was settled when the appeal was claimed. It follows that no excuse is shown for not objecting to the form of the bond within twenty days. The motion to dismiss was not made until more than six months after the receipt of the transcript, and then was not based on the defect of the bond, but on supposed defects in the appeal. It was not made on behalf of the party aggrieved by the omission from the bond. The time has gone by when the appellant can be turned out of court because Mrs. Padgett was not joined as obligee, but if, as we have tried to show, the proper parties were all before the higher court, no doubt leave would be given to file an additional bond if an amendment were desired.
Decree reversed.

Opinion of the Court.

EAGLE MINING & IMPROVEMENT COMPANY v. HAMILTON.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF THE TERRITORY OF NEW MEXICO.
No. 51. Submitted November 7, 1910.-Decided November 28, 1910.
Under the Territorial Practice Act of April 7, 1874, c. 80, 18 Stat. 27, the jurisdiction of this court on appeals is limited to the inquiry whether the findings of fact support the judgment and to a review of duly taken exceptions and rulings on admission or rejection of evidence.
Findings of the District Court when adopted by the Supreme Court of the Territory serve the purpose of the statement of facts required by the statute.
Rulings on questions of evidence are not properly before this court when the exceptions thereto do not appear in the record, and, even though objections to testimony may have been noted, if it does not appear what the rulings were and whether the testimony was or was not excluded, this court is confined to determining whether the findings support the judgment; and in this case the facts found by the court below unquestionably support the judgment.

This is an appeal from a decree of the Supreme Court of the Territory of New Mexico in two suits which were consolidated. The first suit was brought in August, 1903,
VOL. CCXVIi-33

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.

Opinion of the Court.

218 U. S.

in a District Court of the Territory by the appellant, Eagle Mining and Improvement Company, against the appellees, the widow and heirs of Humphrey B. Hamilton, deceased, to have it adjudged that the decedent held a certain undivided interest in mining property in trust for the appellant, and to compel conveyance. In November, 1904, the appellees, one of whom was the administrator of the decedent's estate, brought suit against the appellant, alleging that Hamilton had ren-
dered services as its attorney in connection with the mining property and otherwise, and that the legal title had been taken by him pursuant to an agreement, by which it was to be held as security for the appellant's indebtedness to him; the appellees prayed for foreclosure and recovery of the amount found to be due. The suits were consolidated and a referee was appointed to take testimony. Hearing was had, and a decree was entered in favor of appellees, which set forth separately findings of fact and conclusions of law.
The court found that Hamilton had acquired the legal title to the undivided one-half interest in question under an agreement with the appellant, by which he was to negotiate for the purchase in its behalf and was to surrender a certain equitable claim of lien upon another interest in the property; that in consideration of this surrender and of his services in acquiring the one-half interest Hamilton was to receive the difference between an agreed sum and the amounts to be advanced by the appellant to effect the purchase; that for the payment of this difference-found to amount to $9,500-Hamilton was to hold the legal title as security; and that the agreement to this effect was evidenced by writings signed by Hamilton "and delivered to, accepted and acquiesced in by the said company."
As a conclusion of law, the court found that the heirs of Hamilton were entitled to hold the leeal title to the

Opinion of the Court.

undivided interest until the payment of $9,500, with interest and costs of suit, had been made to the administrator of Hamilton's estate; that upon such payment they should convey to the appellant, and that in default of payment the undivided interest should be sold to
satisfy the indebtedness. It was further found that Hamilton had been retained
by the appellant as its attorney, and at its request had rendered legal services from the date of its organization until his death without express agreement as to the amount to be paid therefor; that these services were reasonably worth $9,510.99, upon which, after deducting payments, there was due $8,419.99. And, as a conclusion of law, the court held that the administrator was entitled to judg-ment for the last-mentioned sum.
It was decreed accordingly, and from this decree appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of the Territory where
it was affirmed. The record before us contains the testimony taken be-
fore the referee, and the letters and documents which, in connection with the testimony, he submitted to the court in his report; and the argument here is directed largely to the effect of the evidence and to the findings of the court below as to matters of fact.
But we are not at liberty to review these findings of fact. We cannot go behind the findings to ascertain whether they are justified by the evidence. Under the act of April 7, 1874, chapter 80, 18 Stat. 27, the jurisdl,',on of this court, upon this appeal, is limited to the inquiry whether the findings of fact made by the court below support its judgment, and to a review of exceptions which have been duly taken to rulings upon the admission or rejection of evidence. Stringfellow v. Cain, 99 U. S. 610; Neslin v. Wells, 104 U. S. 428; Idaho & Oregon Land Company v. Bradbury, 132 U. S. 509; Haws v. Victoria Copper Mining Company, 160 U. S. 303; Grayson v.

Cain, supra; Neslin v. Wells, 8upra; Haws v. Victoria Copper Mining Company, 8upra.
Nor are there any rulings upon questions of evidence which are properly before us for review, for no exceptions to such rulings appear in the record. When the evidence was taken before the referee appointed by the District Court various objections were made and were n6ted upon the record, but the referee did not attempt to pass upon the objections and reported to the court the entire proceedings, including the testimony and documents to which objection had been made. What, if any, rulings were made by the court upon these objections is not shown. In the progress of the cause a memorandum of .opinion was filed by the judge sitting in the District Court, in which the admissibility of certain testimony, relied upon by the appellant, was said to be doubtful, but it does not appear that the testimony was excluded, and as we have said there are no exceptions which bring up any question for review with. respect to the admission or rejection of evidence.
As the facts found by the court below unquestionably support the judgment, it is
Affirmed.

ENRIQUEZ v. GO-TIONGCO.'
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.
No. 95. Argued March 13, 1911.-Decided April 3, 1911.
The Supreme Courtof the Philippine Islands having h.eld that on the death of the wife the husband, if surviving, is entitled to settle the affairs of te community, and on his subsequent death his executor is the proper administrator of the same; and on the facts as found by both courts below, he.d that in this case the communityestate is liable for services rendered with knowledge and consent of all parties in interest in connection with sale of property belonging to it after both husband and wife had died, and that the proper method of collection was by suit against the husband's representative in his capacities of ekecutor and administrator.
THE facts are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Jackson H. Ralston, with whom Mr. Frederick L. Siddons and Mr. William E. Richardson were on the brief, for appellants.
Mr. Aldis B. Browne,with whom Mr. Alexander Britton
and Mr. Evans Browne were on the brief, for appellees.
MR.JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.
This is an appeal'from a judgment of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands, affirming the judgment 'of the Court of First Instance for the city of Manila, which dismissed this suit. The action was brought to set aside a-judgment sale of land in Manila, known as the Old -Theatre, formerly the community property of Antonio Enriquez and his wife, Ciriaca Villainueva. The plaintiffs

and appellants are the administrators of the estate of Antonio, including the interest of Ciriaca Villanueva, and all of the heirs of the two, except Francisco Enriquez, one of the defendants. The other defendants now before the court are the purchaser at the sale and a subsequent pur-
chaser from, him. Ciriaca Villanueva died intestate in 1882. Thereafter
her husband administered the community property until his death in 1884. By a codicil to his will, as stated by
the Supreme Court, he provided "that the inventory, valuation and partition of this estate be made extrajudicially, and by Virtue of the power which the law grants .him he forbids any judicial interference in the settlement thereof, conferring upon his executors the necessary authority therefor, without any restriction whatever, and extending their term of office for such period as may be required for this purpose." The defendant Francisco Enriquez was the executor, and in April, 1886, was ap-
pointed .the general administrator of the estate, including the interest of Ciriaca Villanueva, with directions to pro-
ceed in accordance with the codikil, which he did until March,. 1901, except for a short time in May, 1900. There were no testamentary or ,other proceedings in court, and could not be, by Spanish law, in view of ,the codicil, but it lay with Francisco Enriquez to carry out the trust. There were differences among the heirs, and they made an agreement in August, 1897, for an extrajudicial partition, subject to the provisions of the will, in which Jose Moreno Lacalle was to act as an arbitrator. The partition fell through, but Lacalle rendered services to the two estates, as both courts have found, and on October 23, 1897, it was agreed by Francisco Enriquez, the defendant, and Rafael Enriquez, on behalf, of the plaintiffs, that, the land'in question should be sold, for the purpose, among others, of paying Lacalle. No sale was made, however, and in 1898 Lacalle sued Francisco Enriquez as executor-and ad-

ministrator, as aforesaid. The defendant admitted the debt, stated that he had no money, and pointed out this land for execution. On September 10, 1899, the land was sold for more than the appraised value to the defendant Go-Tiongco, who bought in good faith, and without notice of any claim unless notice is implied by law.
There is no question that every consideration of justice is in favor of the defendants; from whom the plaintiffs are endeavoring to get back the land without restitution of the purchase price and after the last purchaser has made costly improvements. The owners of the land agreed to the rendering of the services, but they attempt to avoid the payment on technical grounds. They say that the debt having been incurredafter the death of the husband and wife, did not bind their estates, that if the claim had been good against the estate of the husband the suit should have been brought against his heirs, and finally, that the judgment against Francisco Enriquez could not bind the estate of Ciriaca, so that the sale must be void, at leastin part. But in our opinion these objections ought not to prevail, on the facts as stated by both courts below and the law as it was administered in the Philippines at the time of the acts.
It seems to have: been understood by everybody that Francisco Enriquez was 'administering both estates in fact, and to have been intended by his appointment in April, 1886, that he should do so by authority of law. The decree under which the plaintiff Rafael Enriquez now is administrator of the estate of both parents, on the face gives him the same authority that Francisco had had befbre. The Supreme Court holds in this case that on the death of the wife the husband, if surviving, is entitled to settle the affairs of the community and that on his death his executor is the proper administrator of the same. See Alfonso v. Natiidad, 6 Phil. Rep. 240. Prado v. Lagera, 7 Phil. Rep. 395. Johnston v. San FranciscoSay-

We should be show to disturb their decision, even if we did not believe it to be right, as we do. But whfen without dispute Antonio was acting, there seems to be no necessity for inquiring whether the appointment could have been avoided if the attempt had been made. The contract with Lacalle, if made by Francisco Enriquez, as seems to have been assumed below, was made as we have said by the wish of all. .he services were rendered in aid of winding up the community business and were a proper charge upon the estate. See Civil Code of 1889, Art. 1064. Sy Chung-Quiong v. Sy-Tiong Tay, .10 Phil. Rep. 141. Francisco Enriquez was the only representative of the estate. The only practicable means of collecting the debt was by suit against him. The record of the suit that was brought most frequently refers to him as executor, but at times as executor and administrator, and the Supreme Court says that as matter of law the suit was directed against him in the latter as well as the former capacity. The judgment must be taken to have bound the community estate. Carter v. Conner, 60 Texas, 52., Lan-, dreaux v. Louque, 43 La. Ann. 234. Other matters would have to be discussed before we could reverse the judgment below, but we see no ground for doubting that it should be affirmed.

624, and Thompson v. United States, 103 U. S. 480. The only ground for making McChesney a defendant is to enjoin him personally from *doing something which hc
may not lawfully do, and to require him personally to do
another thing which it is claimed is his legal duty to do as an administrative act requiring no discretion. If he disobey the mandate or injunction of the court he personally would be in contempt. He only can be rightly made to bear the costs of this proceeding if the complainant should succeed, and he only could be compelled to obey the decree of the court. As his official authority has terminated, the case, so far as it seeks to accomplish the object of the bill, is at an end, there being no statute providing for the substitution of McChesney's successor in a suit of this character. The case is governed by United States v. Boutwell, 17 Wall. 604; United States v. Butterworth, 169 U. S. 600, and Caledonian Coal Co. v. Baker, 196 U. S. 432, 441.

risdiction possessing all powers conferred on Circuit and District Courts of the United States--in fact, the usual powers incident to a court of equity at the date of the Revolution, not incompatible with the changed forms and principles of government or affected by subsequent legislation. Clark v. Mathewson, 7 App. D. C. 382. The inherent power of a court of equity of general jurisdiction over the persons and estates of infants is very wide. Its errors in regard to a sale of real estate of infants are reversible by appellate procedure, but until so corrected its judgment is not a nullity. The voluntary surety on the bond of a trustee in a proceeding to sell real estate is estopped to attack the validity of the decree appointing the trustee or of the bond.
Where the demurrer to one plea of the answer was overruled and plaintiff did not plead further, reversal of the judgment and sustaining the demurrer to that plea leaves the other pleas open to be dealt with by the court below.
This court only having before it the demurrer on one plea to the answer which was overruled below, it reverses the judgment and sustains the demurrer, and other pleas in defense remain at issue and this court will not consider them on this appeal.

Waggaman, as principal, and Daniel B. Clarke, as his surety. The bond was in these words and figures:
"In the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. -In Equity. No. 20225, Docket 46.
Mattie Mc.C. Hine )
VS. Robert Edward Hine et al.
-"Know all men by these. presents, that we, Thomas E. Waggaman, principal, and Daniel B. Clarke, surety, all of the District of "Columbia, acknowledge ourselves indebted to the United States of America in the penal- sum of eighteen'thousand dollars, for the payment of which we bind oursei'es and every of our heirs, executors and administrators, jointly and severally, for and in the whole. Sealed with our seals, and dated this 7th day of July A. D. 1899.
"Whereas the said Thomas E. Waggaman has been duly appointed trustee to make sale of the real estate in the proceedings in this cause mentioned.
"Now the condition of the above obligation is such, that if the above bounden Thomas E. Waggaman shall 'well and truly discharge the duties devolving upon him as such trustee and shall in all things obey such order and. decree as this-court shall make in the premises, then the above obligation to be void and of no effect; else to be in full force and virtue."
The bond, as shown by its recitals, was executed in a pending equity cause in the Supreme Court of the District, wherein, the parties for whose use this suit is brought were parties, either plaintiff or defendant.
The declaration, in substance, averred a breach of the bond, in this: That Waggaman had assumed the duty and function of trustee for the sale directed by the decree, had sold and conveyed the property as directed, but had not accounted for the proceeds, having unfaithfully vio-

lated the trust and confidence reposed in him by squandering and misappropriating such proceeds. Itwas further averred that on November 21, 1Q05, the said Waggaman had disobeyed a decree of the court, requiring him to pay into court the sum of $8,147.27, with interest from August 1, 1904, and was therefore in default.
The defenses with whih. we are concerned upon this
writ are those made by-the surety, who, by a plea which the court below sustained, challenged the obligation of the bond. The insistence is that the Supreme Court of the District exceeded its authority in decreeing a sale of the land which was sold by Waggaman, and his appointment to make such a sale was a nullity, and the bond executed by him with the defendant Clarke as surety mere waste paper.
The proceeding in the Supreme Court in which this bond was executed was a bill in equity to sell lot No. 1912 I street N. W., Washington, D. C., as the property of a minor for purpose of reinvestment under like trusts. The title was held under the will of Robert B. Hine, who died in 1895. So much of the will as concerns the title tothe premises of which a sale was decreed was in these words:
"I give and bequeath to my dear wife, Mattie McC. Hine, a life interest in all my, real estate. As executrix she will collect the income arising from said real*estate, and after paying all necessary expenses of collection, fire insurance and repairs, shall retain the remainder of the income for her own use. After the death'of my said wife, I give and bequeath my real estate to my son, Robert Edward, and any other children that may hereafter be born to me. If my said wife should marry again, she will from the date of such remarriage, be entitled to retain for ler own use, one-half of the net income of my estate, and will pay the remainder to. a trustee for my son, and any other ,hildren who may hereafter be borne to me. Provided, further, that should my wife marry

again, and should no child of mine by her, be then surviving, the whole net income from my estate shall be retained by her, during her life, and after her ileath, ny real estate shall be sold, and of the proceeds, one-third shall be paid to my father, the Rev. Henry Hine now of Boston Spa. Yorkshire England, if he then be living, he not being then living to -my mother Amelia Burnett Hine, neither of them being then living to my sister, Amelia Burnett Iine, and the residue, shall be equally divided between my brothers and sisters share and share alike. If neither parent, nor my sister Amelia Burnett Hine outlives my said wife, then the whole net proceeds of the sale of my real estate, shall be equally divided,
between my brothers and sisters. Should any of these have died, before this distribution takes place, their surviving children shall receive the share of the deceased parent, share and share alike.'
The complainant in the suit' was Mattie McC. Hine, the widow of the testator, who averred that she had never remarried. The defendants were the oxly issue of her marriage with testator, her son Robert E. Hine, then an infant of nine years of age, and the persons who, under the will, were given contingent interests. The minor Robert E. Hine was duly-served and answered by guardian ad -litem. The other defendants were made parties by publication, as persons not to be found in the District. The bill alleged that the dwelling-house was deteriorating in value, that it was often unrented, that repairs, insurance and taxes left an inconsiderable net income, which would go 'on diminishing. That she believed she could obtain $8,500 for the premises, a sum much larger than the value of the property to the remaindermen when her estate should fall in, and that the proceeds could be so invested as to much improve her income and better "enable her to provide for the remainderman during his minority." The bill alleged that the will did not

Opinion of the Court.

prohibit a sale. The prayer was for a decree of sale and for a reinvestment, in pursuance of § 973, Rev. Stat. D. C.
Upon the pleadings and proof the court directed a sale of the said lot, and in the same decree appointed Thomas E. Waggaman "trustee to make the sale," requiring him to execute a bond with surety "conditioned for the faithful performance of the trust reposed in him by this decree, or which may be reposed in him by any future order or decree in the premises." By the same decree he was required "to bring into court the money arising on such sale . . . to be disposed of under the direction of the court," etc.
The contention is that the Supreme Court of the District has no inherent or general power as a court of equity to decree the sale of an infant's property for the purpose of reinvestment, and that its jurisdiction was wholly dependent upon statutory power conferred by §§ 969 el seq., Rev. Stat. D. C., taken from the act of Congress of August 18, 1856. Section 969 reads as follows:
"Where real estate is limited by deed or will to one or more for life or lives, with a contingent limitation over to such issue of one or more of the tenants for life as shall be living at the death of their parent or parents, and the deed or will does not prohibit a sale, the Supreme Court of the District may, upon the application of the tenants for life, and if the court shall be of the opinion that it is expedient to do so, order a sale of such estate, and decree to the purchaser an absolute and complete title in fee simple."
The contention is that the only jurisdiction conferred
by this statute is confined to real estate which is by deed or will "limited to one or more lives, with a contingent limitation over to such issue of one or more of the tenants for life as shall be living at the death of either parent," and that under the will of Robert B. Hine the devise to Robert Edward Hine is a vested and not a contingent

218 U. S.

remainder, while the contingent remainders--contingent on the death of said Robert and the subsequent remarriage of his mother, the said Mattie--are not limitations over to issue of either Robert B. line or Mattie line. For this construction of the statute the court below relied upon Trust Co. v. Muse, 4 App. D. C. 12, 20; Thaw v. Ritchie, 5 Mack. 200, and Clark v. Mathewson, 7 App. D. C. 384.
Clearly under the will there was a life tenant and a remainder over at the death of the life tenant to Robert E. Hine, who was the issue of the testator and of the life tenant. The remainder was not absolute, for if the remainderman should die, and his mother, the life tenant, remarry, this lot was to be sold and the-proceeds paid over to certain collaterals named. Technically the interest was a vested remainder, subject to open and let in the testator's brothers and sisters and to be divested upon the death of Robert E. Hine and remarriage of the life tenant. The contention now is that if the court erred in the construction of the will, or in the interpretation and application of the statute, and decreed a sale for reinvestment, not strictly authorized by the statute, that its action and decree is to be regarded as a nullity, that the sale is void, and that the appointment of Waggaman as trustee and the execution of his bond are absolute nullities.
But if we assume that upon a critical construction-of the will and of the statute the bill seeking a sale of this property for reinvestment did not state a case clearly within the statutory authority of the court, it does not necessarily follow that the decree of sale and all else that occurred are to be treated as mere nullities, subject to collateral attacks such as this is.
The Supreme Court of the District is one of general jurisdiction. It possesses all of the powers which by statute are conferred upon the Circuit and District Courts of the United States. Sections 760 and 765, Rev. Stat.

D. C. It may be said, indeed, to have the usual powers incident to a court of equity at the date of the Revolution, not incompatible with the changed form and principles of government or affected by subsequent legislation. Clark v. Mathewson, 7 App. D. C. 382.
The inherent power of a court of equity over the persons and estates of infants is very wide. For the purpose of maintenance, the power over real estate is undoubtedly more comprehensive than it is over the sale of real estate for purposes of reinvestment, though manifestly for the interest of the minor. The weight of authority seems to be that it does not extend to sales merely because it shall appear to be for the interest of the infant Bispham's Equity, § 549; Story's Equity, § 1357; 3 Pomeroy Equity, §§ 1304, 1309), though there is not lacking very respectable authority for the power to sell real estate when shown to be for the manifest interest of the minor. 2 Kent's Comm., 11th ed., * 230; 5 Johns. Ch. 167; 4 Heisk. (Tenn.) 370, and 7 Baxt. (Tenn.) 502. The Supreme
Court of the District had jurisdiction over the subjectmatter, the res. It had jurisdiction over the parties. It was, according to due course of equity proceeding, called upon to examine the will and the statute which gave the power to make the sale in certain circumstances. If then jurisdiction consists in the power to hear and determine, as has so many times been said, and the court errs in holding that a case has been made either under its inherent power or its statutory authority, can it be said that it has usurped jurisdiction and that its decrees are absolute
nullities? *To this we cannot consent. If the court was one of general and not special jurisdiction, if under its inherent power, supplemented by statutory enlargement; it had jurisdiction under any circumstances to sell the real state of minors for reinvestment, it had jurisdiction to examine and determine whether the particular application was within or beyond its authority. To do this

218 U. S.

was jurisdiction. If it errs, its judgment is reversible by proper appellate procedure. But its judgment, until it be corrected, is a judgment, and cannot be regarded as a nullity.
In the leading case of Ex parte Tobias Watkins, 3 Pet. 193, 203, 206, the opinion was by Chief Justice Marshall. The question arose upon a writ of habeas corpus. The petitioner had been indicted and convicted. He sought to be discharged from prison because the indictment upon its face charged no offense cognizable by courts of the United States. The court said, among other things:
"An imprisonment under a judgment. cannot be unlawful, unless that judgment be an absolute nullity; and it is not a nullity if the court has general jurisdiction of the subject, although it should be erroneous. The Circuit Court for the District of Columbia is a court of record, having general jurisdiction over criminal cases. An offense cognizable in any court, is cognizable in that court. If the offense be punishable by law, that court is competent to inflict the punishment. The judgment of such a tribunal has all the obligation which the judgment of any tribunal can have. To determine whether the offense charged in the indictment be legally punishable or not, is among the most unquestionable of its powers and duties. The decision of this question is the exercise of jurisdiction, whether the judgment be for or against the prisoner. The judgment is equally binding in the one case and in the other; and must remain in full force unless reversed regularly by a superior court capable of reversing it."
After referring to and commenting upon Kempe's Lessee v. Kennedy, 5 Cranch, 173, and Skillern's Executor v. May's Executor, 6 Cranch, 267, the court added:
"Had any offense against the laws of the United States been i'n fact committed, the Circuit Court for the District of Columbia could take cognizance of it. The question

HINE v. MORSE.

218 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

whether any offense was or was not committed, that is, whether the indictment did or did not show that an offense had been committed, was a question which that court was competent to decide. If its judgment was erroneous, a point which this court does not determine, still it is a judgment, and, until reversed, cannot be disregarded."
This case was followed in Ex parte Parks,93 U. S. 18, 23, and in In re Coy, 127 U. S. 731, 757, where this court, speaking by Mr. Justice Miller, said of the language just cited from Ex parte Watkins, that-
"It may be said that this language is too broad in asserting that, because every court must pass upon its own jurisdiction, such decision is itself the exercise of a jurisdiction which belongs to it, and cannot, therefore, be questioned in any other court. But we do not so understand the meaning of the court. It certainly was not intended to say that because a Federal court tries a prisoner for an ordinary common law offense, as burglary, assault and battery, or larceny, with no averment or proof of any offense against the United States, or any connection with a statute of the United States, and punishes him by imprisonment, he cannot be released by habeas corpus because the court which tried him had
assumed jurisdiction. "In all such cases, when the question of jurisdiction is
raised, the point to be decided is, whether the court has jurisdiction of that class of offenses. If the statute has invested th6 court which tried the prisoner with jurisdiction to punish a well-defined class of offenses, as forgery of its bonds or perjury in its courts, its judgment as to what acts were necessary under these statutes to constitute the crime is not reviewable on a writ of habeas
corpus." The principle has been applied in many cases, notably
in cases in which want of jurisdiction as a court of the

United States was apparent on the record. Des Moines Co. v. Iowa Homestead Co., 123 U. S. 552, 557, 559; Dowell v. Applegate, 152 U. S. 327, 337.
In McNitt v. Turner, 16 Wall. 352, 365, the court, after passing upon various jurisdictional objections to a judicial sale of a title in controversy, said:
"But there is a comprehensive and more conclusive answer to all the objections to the sale which have been considered, and to others suggested which have not been adverted to.
"Upon the filing of the notice with the proof of publication, and the subsequent filing of the petition of the administrator for authority to 'sell, the Circuit Court had jurisdiction of the case. No presumption on that subject is necessary. Jurisdiction is authority to hearand determine. It is an axiomatic proposition that when
jurisdiction has attached, whatever errors may subsequently occur in its exercise, the proceeding being coram judice, can 'be impeached collaterally only for fraud. In all other respects it is as conclusive as if it were irreversible in a proceeding for error. The order of sale before us is within this rule. Grignon's Lessee v. Astor et al., 2 How. 341, was, like this, a case of a sale by an administrator. In that case, this court said: 'The purchaser under it is not bound to look beyond the decree. If there is error in it of the most palpable kind, if the court which rendered it have, in the exercise of jurisdiction,
qisregarded, misconstrued, or disobeyed the plain provisions 'of the law which gave them the power to hear and determine the case before them, the title of the purchaser is as much protected as if the adjudication would stand the test of a writ of error;. and so where an appeal is given, but not taken, in the time allowed by law.' This case and the case of Voorhees v. The Bank of the United States, 10 Pet. 449, are the leading authorities in this .court upon'the subject. Other .and later cases have fol-

lowed and been controlled by them. Stow v. Kimball affirms the same doctrine."
The line between a judgment which. is a plain usurpation of jurisdiction and one which is merely erroneous and reviewable only by seasonable appeal, is a plain one. The case in hand falls, in our judgment, within those which are merely reversible upon appellate proceedings, and the judgment decreeing the sale and appointing Waggaman as trustee to make the sale was not a nullity.
In Voorhees v. Bank, 10 Pet. 449, 474, this. court said: "The line which separates error in judgment from the usurpation of power is very definite; and is precisely that which denotes the" cases where a judgment or decree is reversible only by an appellate court, or may be declared a nullity collaterally when it is offered in evidence in an action concerning the matter adjudicated, or purporting to have been so. In the one case, it is a record importing
absolute -verity; in the other, mere waste paper. There can be no middle character assigned to judicial proceedings which are irreversible for error. Such is their effect
between the parties to the suit; and such are the immunities which the law affords to a plaintiff who has obtained an erroneous judgment or execution. It would be a wellmerited reproach to otir jurisprudence if an innocent purchaser, no party to the suit, who had paid his money on the faith of an order of a, court, should not have the same protection under an erroneous proceeding as the party who derived the benefit accruing from it."
In Fauntleroy v. Lum, 210 U. S. 230, 237, it is laid down that a judgment cannot be collaterally impeached byIBshuot waisnidgethat it was based upon a mistake of law.
from the View we have expressed as to the
validity of the proceedings when collaterally attacked, we are of opinion that the question of the validity of the decree of sale, the order appointing Waggaman trustee to make the sale, and the validity of the bond in suit is

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.

Opinion of the Court.

218 U. S.

not open to question by one who voluntarily became the surety upon the bond, thereby enabling his principal to obtain the proceeds of sale. Having obtained the trust and confidence of the court by aid of the security afforded by the solemn obligation to faithfully execute the order of the court and to pay into the court the proceeds of the sale which he undertook to make, neither the trustee so appointed, nor the surety for his performance of the trust, are in a situation to deny the regularity of the transaction. The proceeds which Waggaman received are either the funds of the beneficial owners of the property, or, if the sale be in fact void so far as to confer no title, the purchaser in equity and justice must be protected before the money is distributed. The benefit which Waggaman expected to secure, he has been enabled to enjoy through the voluntary execution of this bond by Clarkelas his surety. That bond recites his due appointment, and it would be inequitable and unjust to permit either the principal or his surety to deny the fact.
This rule of estoppel has been applied in many cases. It was applied in respect to the bond of an Indian agent. The surety upon the bond denied liability because the Government did not produce the commission showing the appointment of his principal. The court' said: "The bond upon which the suit was brought recites that he was appointed Indian agent and the obligors in the bond are therefore estopped from denying it." Bruce v. United States, 17 How. 437, 442.
The principle was applied to a distiller's bond where one of the defenses was that the bond was invalid. The court said:
"But we prefer to place our judgment upon the broader ground marked out by the adjudications of this court, to which we have referred. Every one is presumed to know the law. Ignorance standing alone can never be the basis of a legal right. If a bond is liable to the objec-

tion taken in this case and the parties are dissatisfied, the objection should be made when the bond is presented for execution. If executed under constraint, the constraint will destroy it. But where it is voluntarily entered into and the principal enjoys the benefits which it is intended to secure and a breach occurs, it is then too late to raise the question of its validity. The parties are estopped from availing themselves of such a defense. In such cases there is neither injustice nor hardship in holding that the contract as made is the measure of the rights of the government and of the liability of the obligors." United States v. Hodson, 10 Wall. 395, 409.
It was applied in respect of a stay bond executed under a void act of legislation. "Not to apply the principle of estoppel to the bond in this case would," said the court, "it seems to us, involve a mockery in judicial administration and a violation of the plainest principles of reason and justice." Daniels v. Tearney, 102 U. S. 415, 422.
The opinions of the highest courts of the States are full of applications of the rule of estoppel. In Plowman v. Henderson, 59 Alabama, 559, the sureties upon the bond of an administrator were not permitted to show the illegality of his appointment. To the same effect is White v. Weatherbee, 126 Massachusetts, 450.
The sureties upon the bond of a sheriff were held estopped to deny validity of his appointment or the regularity of his bond. Jones v. Gallatin County, 78 Kentucky, 491.
In People v. Norton, 9 N. Y. 176, the sureties uponothe bond of a trustee appointed by a chancery court were held estopped to deny the validity of the order appointing him.

a plea which set out the proceedings in the case in which the bond had been taken, and averred their nullity for want of jurisdiction. Another and distinct defense relied upon in the plea was that after the proceeds of sale had come into the possession of said Waggaman that Mattie McC. Hine, one of -the beneficiaries for whose use this suit is prosecuted by the United States, had agreed with the said Waggaman that he should retain in his possession and for his own purposes the fund aforesaid, and should pay to her interest at the rate of five per cent per annum, quarterly. That this agreement was acted upon and the interest so paid from the date of the receipt of the proceeds in 1899 to May 1, 104, and that the agreement was without the knowledge or consent of the surety. There'was a demurrer and joinder thereon to so much of the said plea as set out and relied upon the nullity of the proceedings under which the bond had been executed, and a replication and issue upon the plea relying upon any alleged agreement between Waggaman, the principal, and Mrs. Hine, as one of the beneficiaries in the bond. The demurrer was overruled and complainants electing to stand upon it, declined to further plead; whereupon the action was dismissed. From this judgment there was an appeal to the Court of Appeals of the District, where the judgment was affirmed.
So much of the plea as sought to defend the action in whole or in part in consequence of the alleged agreement between the principal in the bond and Mrs. Hine without the consent of the surety remains at issue undisposed of, and is accordingly not considered by us.
The.judgment of the Court of Appeals so far as it de-
termined the validity of the plea aforesaid was erroneous, and the case' is reversed and remanded with direction to sustain the demurrer and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
Reversed.

LEWIS v. LUCKETT.
ERROR TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
No. 142. Submitted April 25, 1911.-Decided May 29, 1911.
Under § 130 of the Code of the District of Columbia as amended by the act of June 30, 1902, 32 Stat. 526, c. 1329, there is no failure of jurisdiction because publication for unknown heirs has not been made, unless the record shows the actual or probable existence of persons who were heirs at law or next of kin whose names were unknown; nor will proceedings duly had be vacated at the instance of one who was cited, and whose objections to probate have been overruled, and who does not show that there are any unknown heirs or next of kin or that there is any occasion to make such publication.
32 App. D. C. 188, affirmed.

LEWIS v. LUCKETT. Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE LURTON delivered the opinion of the court.

An instrument purporting to be the last will and testament of Mary Hoskins Lewis was offered for probate by L. F. Luckett, who was named as executor therein. The petition asking probate averred that the only beneficiary under the will was the defendant in error, Margaret Estelle Jones, and that the decedent left "no heir at law or next of kin.so far as petitioner knew, with the exception of David W. Lewis," her husband. Lewis was made a de-
fendant and cited. He appeared, filed a caveat and denied that the will was the will of the decedent. Miss Jones appeared and filed her petition asking that the will be admitted to probate. She averred that Mrs. Lewis had left neither heir nor next of kin, save her husband, but asked that publication be made for unknown heirs. Both petitions asked that issues be framed for trial by a jury. Issues were accordingly settled and a day named by order of the court for trial.
The jury, on February 3, 1908, found the issues in favor of the proponents of the will, the trial having been had so far as appears without objection by anyone, and without any suggestion that there were heirs or next of kin in existence who should be brought before the court. Thus the matter stood until February 24, when the court ordered publication for unknown heirs and next of kin of the said Mary Hoskins Lewis, "and for all others concerned," to appear on April 3d and show cause why the application for probate of the will should not be granted. Publication was duly made.
Pending such publication Lewis moved the court to vacate the order framing issues, and all subsequent proceedings, because there had been no publication for unknown heirs or next of kin of the decedent when the issues were framed or tried. On April 8, this motion was denied,

and on April 15 the will was ordered to be recorded as the last will and testament of Mary Hoskins Lewis.
From that judgment David W. Lewis appealed to the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, which affirmed the action of the court below. From this judgment
of affirmance, this writ of error has been sued out. The only question relied upon for reversal is that the
Probate Court had no jurisdiction to admit the will of Mrs. Lewis to probate, because the issues under the caveat filed by the plaintiff in error and the trial of those issues by a jury was prior to the publication for unknown heirs and next of kin of the decedent.
The procedure for the probate of wills is to be found in §§ 130 to 141, inclusive, of the Code of the District of Columbia. Section 130 deals with notice when there is no caveat, upon presentation of a petition asking probate, and requires a citation to issue to all persons who would be interested in the estate if no will had been executed, and that if such persons are "returned as not to be found," then there shall be a publication for such persons. No such return was made in this case. No persons were cited or could be cited, except David W. Lewis, who was duly cited as the only known person interested in case there was no will.
Section 140 deals with the trial of issues when a caveat is filed. That section provides that "if, as to any person in interest, the notification shall be returned 'not to be found,' the court shall assign a new day for such trial and order publication." In the present case there was no return of notice, "not to be found," as to any person supposed to be interested.
But § 130 was amended by the act of June 30, 1902,
32 Stat. 526, by a provision in these words: "In all cases where it is made to appear to the satisfac-
tion of the court that all or any of the next of kin or heirs at law of the deceased are unknown, such unknown next

of kin or heirs at law may be proceeded against and described in the publication of notice hereinbefore provided for as 'the unknown next of kin,' or 'the unknown heirs at law,' as the case may be, of the deceased, and by such publication of such notice under such designation such unknown next of kin and heirs at law shall be as effectually bound and concluded as if known and their names were specifically set forth in said order of publication."
Assuming that publication for unknown heirs and next of kin is authorized, whether a caveat has been filed or not, it is evident that there is no failure of jurisdiction because such publication was not made, unless there was something in the record showing that there were persons actually or probably in existence who were heirs at law or next of kin whose names were unknown. The language of the opening line of the amendment is, "In all cases where it is made to appear to the satisfaction of the court that all or any of the next of kin or heirs at law of the deceased are unknown, such unknown," etc., "may be proceeded against," etc.
Now, what was the case here? The petition of the propounder of the will, the executor named therein, averred that upon his information and belief there were no heirs at law or next of kin, except David W. Lewis. Margaret Estelle Jones, the sole beneficiary under the will, made a like averment in her petition, joining in the prayer for probate and for the framing of issues to be tried by jury. David W. Lewis, the husband of the decedent, and interested only in case there was no will, made no averment that there were any persons other than himself interested in preventing probate. He asked the court to frame issues for a jury trial. He obtained such an order himself. He also obtained an order setting a day, months ahead, for the trial of such issues. The trial came on. He made no suggestion that there were any unknown heirs at law or next of kin, and asked no order of publication for them.

Opinion of the Court.

The trial of the issues was fatal to him. The court before ordering the will to be recorded upon the verdict, took the precaution to order publication for any unknown heirs or next of kin, and for all other persons concerned, to appear and show cause, by a day named, why this will should not be probated. Then, and only then, did the appellant wake up. But only to ask that the court vacate the order settling the issues and the verdict of the jury thereon, because this publication had not been made before any step had been taken. Neither then, nor at any other time, did he ever suggest that there were anywhere upon the surface of the earth any person who was an heir at law or next of kin. There was under such circumstances no reason for publishing for people about whose existence there was no shadow of evidence. The fact that the court out of precaution held up the final probate until publication might be made, does not raise a presumption that there were any such persons. Hollingsworth v. Barbour, 4 Pet. 466, 477.
Under the facts of this case there was no occasion to make publication for unknown heirs at law or next of kin, and no error in denying the application to vacate the verdict, or in ordering the will to probate.
Affirmed.
