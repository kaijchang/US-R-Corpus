TILT v. KELSEY.
Statement of the Case.

TILT v. KELSEY, COMPTROLLER OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
ERROR TO THE SURROGATES' COURT OF THE COUNTY OF NEW
YORK AND STATE OF NEW YORK.
No. 18. Argued January 28. 1907.-Decided October 21, 1907.
Where judicial proceedings in one State are relied upon as a defense to an assessment by the authorities of another State a right under the Constitution of the Unit&d States is specially set up and claimed though it was not in terms stated to be such a right.
An adjudication by the probate, court that a testator was a resident of' the State though essential to the assumption -of jurisdiction to grant letters testamentary is not necessarily conclusive on the question of domicil nor even evidence of it in a collateral proceeding, and, under the full faith and credit clause of the Federal Constitution, is not binding upon the courts of another State.
In respect to the settlement of successions to property on death the States are sovereign and may give to their courts the authority to determine finally as against all the world all questions which arise therein, subject to applicable constitutional limitations.
Where the decree of the probate court is final and bars all persons having claims against the estate, the courts of another State must, under the full faith and credit clause of the Federal Constitution, give similar force and effect to such a decree, when rendered by a court having jurisdiction to probate the will and administer the estate, and hed that such a final decree in New Jersey was a bar in the courts of another State against the taxing authorities of the latter State attempting to enforce a claim for inheritance tax on the ground that the testator was at the time of his death domiciled therein.
182 N. Y. 557, reversed.
THis is a writ of error from this court to the Surrogates' Court of the County and State of New Yo~rk to review a judgmtent entered in that court in pursuance of an order of the Court of Appeals of that State. The judgment assessed a succession tax upon the personal estate of Albert Tilt, deceased, upon the ground that he was at the time of his death a resident of the State of New York. Before the assessment of the tax the estate of Tilt, who died testate, was fully administered in

the courts of New Jersey, where the will was probated. In the course of the administration all the personal property, after paying debts, taxes and charges of administration, was distributed by the executors to the beneficiaries under the will. A reversal of the judgment of the. Surrogates' Court is sought for the reason that it (lid not give full faith and credit to the judicial proceedings of the State of New Jersey, as required by the Constitution and laws of the United States.

Mr. William G. Wilson for plaintiffs in error: The legal residence of deceased at the time of his death was in New Jersey. The right, in this country, of each individual, to change his residence at will, cannot be questioned. Change of citizenship, as distinguished from change of residence, is not always so simple a matter,' and a change of residence does not in itself necessarily involve any change of citizenship. Where the intent is not clear, it has to be inferred from the circumstances surrounding the act.' But when the intent is clear, acts in furtherance. of it should -b. e interpreted in the light of the known intent..' Dupuy v. Wurtz, 53 N. Y. 556; Thorndike v. Boston, 1 Met. 242. The right which every fndividual has to change his residence at will could not be denied or restricted by reason of the fact that a party already possessed two "homes," one in New York City, and one in Mount Arlington, New Jersey, and occupied each, with his family, for about one-half of each year. This is one of the cases where, in the language of Chief Justice Shaw, "very slight circumstances must often decide the question." Story on Conflict of Laws, § 47; Somerville v. Somerville, 5 Vesey, 750; Thayer v. Boston, 124 Massachusetts, 132. The probate of the will in New Jersey is conclusive upon
the question of his residence for purposes of administration, and tax under the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution.

estates of decedents in which the State acts in the exercise of its sovereignty. It has absolute control, except for the limitations imposed by the Federal Constitution which recognize and enforce the sovereignty of the State within those limitations, in the very provision above quoted. See Plant v.
Harrison,36 Misc. (N. Y.) 649. The decree of the surrogate of Morris County, New Jersey,
admitting the will of Albert Tilt to probate as the will of a resident of that county, is conclusive here if it is conclusive in New Jersey. If the probate is conclusive in New Jersey the question is not an open one. This is a question not answered by referring to general principles of law, by determining what at common law was the significance and effect of a judgment, but can be answered only by an examination of the decisions of the courts of New Jersey. Hancock National Bank v. Farnum, 176 U. S. 643.
New Jersey is not, as Connecticut is, an exception to the general rule that the record of probate should be collaterally invulnerable.

Mr. George M. Judd, for defendant in error, submitted: The decree of a probate court is in the nature of a proceeding in rem, and therefore any ground or fact upon which that decree professes to be founded can be inquired into in a proceeding in another State, brought by a person not a party to the probate proceedings. Life Ins. Co. v. Tisdale, 91 U.S. 238. The decree of the Surrogate's Court in New Jersey, granting letters testamentary, is conclusive only upon the point adjudicated--whether the parties named receive letters testamentary. That was the res, and upon that only has there been an adjudication. Residence was not the res and it was not the point adjudicated; therefore said decree is not conclusive as to residence in a distinct and separate proceeding brought by the Comptroller of the State of New York to fix a transfer tax

alleged to be due the State of New York. Brigham v. Fayerweather, 140 Massachusetts, 411.
The probate proceeding in New Jersey was only formal, the probate of the will was not opposed; there was not a full and fair investigation of the facts; the state comptroller was not a party in the sense that he was entitled to be heard, or to take an appeal, and unless he had that right, he was not concluded by the adjudication of facts upon which the decree is grounded. 3 Wigmore on Evidence, § 1347, p. 1636.
Leaving out of consideration the ex parte nature of the probate proceedings, in view of the fact that by § 15 of the statutes of New Jersey, residence of the decedent in the county is made one of the jurisdictional facts upon which the probate court of that .county bases its decree admitting the will to probate, and in view of the further fact that an exemplified copy of the decree of that probate court has been offered in evidence by the appellant's claiming a benefit under it, it is a general rule of law, applicable to the circumstances of this case, that this court is not precluded from inquiring into the question of residence.
The fact that the record of the probate proceedings in New Jersey recites the jurisdictional fact of residence can make no difference. General Statutes of New Jersey, published by authority of the legislature under acts of April 4, 1894, and March 20, 1895, Chapter 234 of Laws of 1898 (fols. 148-150). See also Hard v. Shipman, 6 Barb. 623; Bolton v. Schriever, 135 N. Y. 73; Matter of Law, 56 App. Div. 454; Ferguson v. Crawford, 70 N. Y. 253; Thompson v. Whitman, 18 Wall. 457; Thorman v. Frame, 176 U. S. 350; Plant v. Harrison, 36 Misc. Rep. 649, cited by plaintiffs in error, distinguished.
MR. JUSTICE MOODY, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court.
In the disposition of this case we are somewhat embarrassed by our ignorance of the reasons which controlled the decision of the highest court of the State. The opinion of the surro-

gate was very brief. His judgment was affirmed upon appeal successively by the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals -in each court without an opinion and with two judges dissenting. The record shows the following facts: Albert Tilt was engaged in business as a silk manufacturer in Paterson, New Jersey, until the time of his death. Until 1888 he was
a resident and citizen of Paterson. In that year he removed to New York City, became a resident and citizen of. New York, and remained such until some time in the year 1899. He died in New York on May 2, 1900. His residence and citizenship at the time of his death was in dispute. For many years he. had owned a house in New York City, where he lived during
the greater part of the year, and another house in Roxbury, New Jersey, where he lived during the summer and early autumn. It is contended by the executors of his will, the plaintiffs in error, that in the last year of his life he changed his domicil from New York City to Roxbury and that at the time of his death he was domiciled in New Jersey. On the other hand, it is contended by the Comptroller of New York, the defendant in error, that his domicil continued until his death to be in New York. Upon this question the evidence was conflicting.
After the'death of Mr. Tilt, his will was admitted to probate by the surrogate of Morris County, New Jersey, who by law had jurisdiction to do this if the testator resided in the county at the time of his death. The petition for probate described the testator as "late of the township of Roxbury, in said county," and the letters testamentary granted on May 23, 1900, by the surrogate described him as "late of the county of' Morris, deceased." An order was made fixing a time within which creditors must prove claims against the estate. On the expiration of this time a further order was made, that all creditors who had neglected t6 bring in their claims and demands should "be forever barred from their action therefor against the executors of said deceased." Succession taxes, imposed by the law of New Jersey and the law of the United

States, and all debts, were paid. The executors presented their accounts to the Orphans' Court of the county, and that court, acting within its jurisdiction, on June 20, 1901, allowed the accounts and directed the distribution of the estate, according to the terms of the will. The executors made the distribution in conformity with the court's order, thereby parting with all the property of the testator which had been in their hands. After the distribution had been accomplished the State of New York for the first time made known its claim for a trans-
fer tax. The comptroller of the State filed his petition with the surrogate of the county of New York. In response to this petition, on August 16, 1901, Robert Mazet was appointed by the surrogate as appraiser to fix the fair market value of the property of Albert Tilt, deceased. This was done with the view of ascertaining the amount of a transfer tax due under a section of a statute providing for such a tax "when the transfer is by will or by the intestate laws of this State from any person dying seized and possessed of the property while a resident of the State." On March 6, 1903, Mazet filed his report in the Surrogates' Court. The material part of this report was: first, that the net personal property of the deceased "subject to tax herein" was at the time of his death of the fair market Value of $1,056,951.22; second, that Tilt was a resident of New York City at the time of his death; third, that he left a will which had been "duly admitted to probate in the'Surrogate's Court of the County of Morris, State of New Jersey;" fourth, after stating the disposition of his property made by the testator by this will, the report appraised the estate "subject to tax herein" at its fair market value at the amount already stated. On June 15, 1903, the surrogate entered an order adopting the value of the property reported by the appraiser and assessing the amount of the transfer tax specifically on each bequest contained in the will. The total tax amounted to about thirteen thousand dollars. On August 10, 1903, a paper, entitled "Appeal to the Surrogate,"
was filed by the executors. This paper gave notice of an ap-

peal to the surrogate from the appraisement, assessment, and determination of the transfer tax, and 'from the surrogate's own order of June 15. The only ground of appeal which need be stated here is the fifth, which alleged "that the right to assess or impose a tax under the laws of the State of New York upon the transfer of the property of the testator, if there ever was any such right, was barred. before the commencement of this proceeding, by a decree of the Orphans' Court of Morris County, New Jersey, a court of competent jurisdiction, made on the twenty-fifth day of February, 1901, barring all claims against the said testator or his estate which had not been presented and proved to said executors, pursuant to public notice heretofore given and published, as prescribed by the laws of the State of New Jersey; and by the further decree of the same court, made on the twentieth day of June, 1901, directing the distribution of the estate of said testator in the -hands of said executors, according to the terms of the will of the said Albert"Tilt, deceased; in obedience to which the said executors, without any notice or knowledge of any claim or liability for the payment of a transfer tax under the laws of the State of New York, distributed the said estate, so that there was not at the time of the commencement of this proceeding, and is not now, any property of the said estate in the hands of said executors." It was then agreed by counsel that
the surrogate should determine on affidavits whether or not Albert Tilt was a resident of New York at the time of his death. Pending the consideration of this question the executor requested in writing certain findings of facts and conclusions oi law, of which only two need be stated here. They are as follows: (2) "Under the Constitution of the United States full faith and credit must be given to the probate of said will and codicil of said Albert Tilt in the State of New Jersey, and to the accounting and distribution made by his executors under the decree of the Orphans' Court of Morris County in said State, of the estate of said Albert Tilt as a resident of New Jersey at the time of his death." (3) "None of the personal

estate of said Albert Tilt is subject to the payment of a transfer tax under the laws of the State of New York, excepting only such of his personal estate as was actually, within the State of New York at the time of his death." Theso requests were refused by the surrogate, who, in a short opinion, found as a fact that Tilt was a resident of New York at the time of his death, and ruled that his personal estate, wherever situated, was subject to the payment of a transfer tax under the laws of New York. An order was accordingly entered affirming the order of June 15. Thereupon the executors filed exceptions, the last two of which were as follows: (20) "To the refusal of the said Surrogate to find as a conclusion of law that under the Constitution of the United States full faith and credit must be given to the' probate of-said will and codicil of said Albert Tilt in the State of New Jersey, and to the accounting and distribution made by his executors under the decree of the Orphans' Court of Morris County in said State, of the estate of said Albert Tilt as a resident of New Jersey at the time of his death. (21) To the refusal of the said Surrogate to find as a conclusion of law that none of the personal estate- of said Albert Tilt is subject. to the payment of a transfer tax under the laws of the State of New York, excepting only such of his personal estate as was actually within the State of New York
at the time of his death." An appeal was then taken, and, as already stated, the action of the surrogate was affirmed by the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals. The proceedings before the surrogate are somewhat fully set forth, because it is contended that no Federal question was properly and
seasonably raised in the state courts.. We think, however, that a right under the Constitution of the United States was specially set up and claimed by the executors, as required by § 709 of the Revised Statutes, and denied by the highest court of the State, and that therefore we have authority to reexamine the decision. It appears clearly in the paper entitled "Appeal to the Surrogate" that the executors relied upon the judicial proceedings in New Jersey as a defense to the assessment of

TILT v. 'KELSEY.

Opinion of the Court.

the New York tax. They "specially set up and claimed" a right under those proceedings, though it was not in terms stated to be a right claimed under the Constitution. This, in the case of a judgment of the court of another State, has been held to be a sufficient compliance with the statute. Great Western Telegraph Co. v. Purdy, 162 U. S. 329; Bell v. Bell, 181 U. S. 175; Andrews v. Andrews, 188 U. S. 14, and see the remark of the Chief .Justice in Mutual Life Insurance Company v. McGrew, 188 U. S. 291, 311. Moreover, while the surrogate still had the appeal under consideration and undecided, requests in writing were made to him which clearly and specifically set up the claim that the full faith and credit due, under the Constitution, to the judicial proceedings of the State of New Jersey forbade the assessment of the tax. These requests were entertained and the claim denied by the surrogate and an exception taken. Upon the record thus made an appeal was taken,, and in the disposition of the appeal the Federal question was necessarily passed upon by the highest court of the State, whose decision, therefore, we may reexamine.
That reexamination, however, must be confined to the single question whether by the assessment of the tax full faith and credit has been denied to the judicial proceeding of the State of New, Jersey in violation of Article IV, section 1, of the Constitution. In the consideration of this question, the first ,inquiry which presents itself is whether the adjudication of the New Jersey court, that Tilt was at the time of his death a resident of New Jersey, was conclusive upon the State of New York,, a stranger to the proceedings. If it was that is the end of the case, because then New York could not take the first step necessary to bring the estate within the provision of the tax law of that State. But upon principle and authority that adjudication, though essential to the assumption of jurisdiction to grant letters testamentary, was neither conelhsive on the question of dornicil, nor even evidence of it in a collateral proceeding.

Overby v. Gordon, 177 U. S. 214; Dallinger v. Richardson, 176 Massachusetts, 77; and see Mutual Benefit Life Ins. Co. v. Tisdale, 91 U. S. 238; De Mora v. Concha, 29 Ch. Div. 268; aff'd 11 App. Cases, 541; Brigham v. Fayerweather,140 Massachusetts, 411. The difference in the effect of a judgment on the res before the court and of the adjudication of the facts on which the judgment is based is pointed out by Mr. Justice Holmes in the last case. In an opinion, holding that a decree of a probate court admitting a will to probate was not, on an issue between parties one of whom was not a party to the probate proceedings, competent evidence of the testator's mental capacity, he said: "A judgment in rem is an act of the sovereign power; and, as such, its effects cannot be disputed, at least within the jurisdiction. If a competent court declares a vessel forfeited, or orders it sold free of all claims, or divorces a couple, or establishes a will, . . . a paramount title is passed, the couple is divorced, the will is established as against all the world, whether parties or not, because the sovereign has said that it shall be so. But the same is true when the judgment is that A recover a debt of B. The public force is pledged to collect the debt from B, and no one within the jurisdiction can oppose it. And it does not follow ihthe former case any more than in the latter, nor is it true, that the judgment, because conclusive on all the world in what we* may call its legislative effect, is equally conclusive upon all as an adjudication of the facts upon which it is grounded. On the contrary, those judgments, such as sentences of prize courts, to which the greatest effect has been giveh in collateral *proceedings, are said to be conclusive evidence of the facts upon which they proceed only against parties who were entitled to be heard before they were rendered. We may lay on one side, then, any argument based on the misleading expression thAt all the world are parties to a proceeding in rem. This does not mean that all the world, are entitled to be heard, and as strangers in interest are not, entitled to be
heard, there is no reason why they should be bound by the

TILT v. KELSEY.

207 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

findings of fact, although bound to admit the title or status which the judgment establishes." We think that this quotation expresses the correct rule and that it is sustained by the decisions of this court. Applying it here, it follows that the full faith and credit due to the proceedings of the New Jersey court do not require that the courts of New York shall be. bound by its adjudication on the question of domicil. On the contrary, it is open to the courts of any State in the trial of a collateral issue to determine upon the evidence produced the true domicil of the deceased.
But assuming that the New York court had the right to determine, and determined rightly, the domicil of the deceased, what then? The grievance here is not the finding that Mr. Tilt died a resident of New York. It is the assessment, based upon that finding, of a transfer tax upon the legaciescontained in. his will. The real question in the case is whether the assessment of that tax by the State of New York is consistent with the full faith and credit required by the Constitution to be given to the judicial proceedings of another State. After the will had been allowed and letters testamentary had been issued by the New Jersey surrogate, the executors named in the will took possession of all the personal property of the testator (the real property not being concerned in this litigation) and began to administer it in accordance with the terms of the will and under the direction of the court. That property, appraised at about one million dollars, consisted of bank deposits almost entirely in New Jersey banks, life insurance policies, a few small mortgages, notes and accounts receivable, furniture, horses and carriages, and (constituting more than eight-tenths of the whole of the personal estate) stock in New Jersey corporations. A limit of time was fixed for the presentation of claims against the estate, at the expiration of which it was decreed that all creditors who had neglected to bring in their demands should be barred from any action thereon against the executors. What was then done appears in an affidavit of a witness, which was agreed by counsel in

OCTOBER TERM, 1907.

207 U. S.

the hearing before the New York surrogate to show the facts. The affidavit is in part as follows: "Said executors accounted as such in the Orphans' Court of said Morris County, New Jersey, which court had jurisdiction under the laws of New Jersey to entertain such accounting and to direct final distribution of the estate of said testator thereon, and such proceedings were thereupon had that on June 20, 1901, a decree was made in said Orphans' Court by the judge presiding therein, finally settling and allowing the accounts of said executors, and directing the distribution of the balance of the estate of said Albert Tilt remaining in the hands of said executors according to the terms of said will. Thereupon and prior to August, 1901, such distribution was made by said executors pursuant to the terms of said will, in conformity with the direction of said decree, and thereafter there remained in the hands of said executors no money or personal property whatsoever of the estate of said Albert Tilt."
Thus executors appointed by a court having upon the face of the record authority to make the appointment, had accounted for the property which had come into their hands to the court having jurisdiction under the laws of the State to pass on the accounts, and, without knowledge of any claim by the State of New York, had, by the direction of the court acting within its jurisdiction, paid out the whole estate to those who were entitled to it by the will." All that was done by the executors, and all that was received by the beneficiaries in the disp6sition of the estate, was done and received by orders of court, duly entered in the course of judicial proceedings. For the purpose of enabling the executors to distribute the estate with safety to themselves, in accordance with a common practice in the settlement of the estate of deceased persons, and, under authority conferred by the laws of the State, the court, prior to the distribution, had decreed that all those who had neglected to bring in their claims should be "forever barred from their action therefor against the executors of the deceased." Upon these facts does the assessment of this

TILT v. KELSEY.

207 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

transfer tax by the State of New York, by whose laws the tax thus assessed is made a lien on the property transferred and a personal obligation of the transferee and the executors (§222, ch. 908, Laws of 1896), give the full faith and credit to which these judicial proceedings are entitled? The answer to this question depends upon the nature of the proceedings and their effect upon the rights of those persons who were not parties or privies to them. If they are binding upon such persons the State of New York may not levy a tax upon property which has been transferred free from the burden and impose a personal liability on the executors who have been declared forever exempt from all demands against the estate. The enforcement of the claim for such a tax against the property, against the distributees of the property, and against those who have distributed it, under the direction of the court, and with its assurance that no claims against them shall longer exist, is plainly inconsistent with the judicial proceedings by which the property has been administered. Is then the nature
of the proceedings such that they are binding not only upon those who were parties or privies to them, but upon all others as well?
When the owners of property die, that property, under the conditions and restrictions of the law applicable, is transmitted to their successors named by their wills or by the laws regulating inheritance in cases of intestacy. For a suitable time it is essential that the property should remain under the control of the State, until all just charges against it can be discovered and paid, and those entitled to it as new owners can be ascertained. It is in the public interest that the property should come under the control of the new. owners, after such delays only as will afford opportunity for investigation and hearing to guard against mistake, injustice, or fraud. It is the duty
of the sovereign to provide a tribunal, under whose direction the just demands against the estate may be determined and paid, the succession decreed, and the estate devolved to those who are found to be entitled to it. Sometimes this duty is

performed by conferring jurisdiction upon a single court and sometimes by dividing the jurisdiction among two or three courts. The courts may be termed ecclesiastical, probate, orphans', surrogate or equity courts. The jurisdiction may be exercised exclusively in one, or divided among two or more, as the sovereign shall determine. But somewhere the power must exist to decide finally as against the world all questions which arise in the settlement of the succession. Mistakes niay occur and sometimes do occur, but it is better that they.should be endured than that, in a vain search for infallibility, questions shall remain open indefinitely.. As was said by Mr. Justice Bradley, speaking on this subject in Broderick's Will, 21 Wall. 503, p. 519: "The world must move on, and those who claim an interest in persons and things must be charged with knowledge of their status and condition, and of the vicissitudes to which they are subject. This is the foundation of all judicial proceedings in rem." It is therefore within the power of the sovereign to give to its courts the authority, while settling the Isuccession of estates in their possession through their officers, the executors or administrators, to determine finally as against the world all questions which arise therein. Grignon v. Astor, 2 How. 319, per Baldwin, J., p. 338; Beauregard v. New Orleans, 18 How. 497; Foulke v. Zimmerman, 14 Wall. 113; Board of Public Works v.

In respect to the settlement of the successions to property on death the States of the Union are sovereign and may give to their judicial proceedings such conclusive effect, subject to the requirements of due process of law and to any other constitutional limitation which may be applicable.

207 U. S.

Opinion of the Coirt.

But though a State may attach to the judicial proceedings of the courts, through which the devolution of the estates of deceased persons is accomplished, the conclusive effect which has been described, it may not choose 'to do so, or may choose to do so only in respect of part of the adjudications made in the course of the settlement of the succession. It may, for instance, choose to regard the probate of a will or the grant of letters of administration as conclusive on all, and on the other hand to regard an order of distribution as open to attack in a collateral proceeding by those who were not parties to it. The extent to which such proceedings shall be held conclusive is a matter to be determined by each State according to its own views of public policy. The variations in practice in the different States are considerable and no good purpose would be served; by considering them. It is enough to instance that in the States of Connecticut and Massachusetts, according to the cases just cited, a decree of distribution is binding upon all, while in the State of New York it appears not to be binding on 6ne who Was not a party to it. In r Killan, 172 N. Y. 547.
When, therefore,, we come to consider what faith and credit must be given- to these judicial proceedings of New Jersey, we must first ascertain what effect that State attaches to them. The statute enacted to carry into effect the constitutional provisioff provided that they should have in any court within the United States such faith and credit "as they have by law and us.ge in the courts of the States from which they are taken."

In ascertaining, on a writ of error to a state court, what credit' is given to these judicial proceedings by the laws and usages of the State of New Jersey, we are limited to the evidence on that subject before the court whode judgment.we are reviewing.

It tended to show that the surrogate had jurisdiction to probate the will and issue letters testamentary and that the probate and issue of letters could not beimpeached in a collateral proceeding; that the surrogate had "under the laws of New Jersey full and competent jurisdiction" to make the Qrder limiting the time for creditors of the estate to bring in their demands, and the subsequent order that all who had neglected to do so "should be forever barred from their action therefor against the executors of saidI deceased;" that the acts of the surrogate cannot be impeac ied collaterally, and that the Orphans' Court had jurisdion under the laws of New Jersey "to direct final distribution of the estate of said testator," and it cited four cases from the New Jersey reports, Coursen'sWill, 3 Green's Ch. 408, Quidort's Adm'r v. Pergeaux, 18 N. J. Eq.. 472, Ryno's Ex'r v. Ryno's Adm'r, 27 N. J. Eq. 522, and Straub'scase, 49 N. J. Eq. 264. In relying upon evidence of this kind we are quite aware that we may not ascertain with the precision which might be desired the
credit which the State of New Jersey attaches to these judicial proceedings. But. it is all that we can have. We think that
,we may safely infer from it that the order of the surrogate barring all creditors who had failed to bring in the demand from any further claim against the executors was binding upon all. It was an order which he had "full and competent'authority to make," and it was one of the acts which could not be impeached collaterally. We think also that the jurisdiction to direct a final distribution means a distribution which shall be final, so.far at least as any person having a demand against the estate is concerned. If we have discerned correctly' the effect which New Jersey gives to these judicial proceedings, it is obvious that the assessment of this tax denies them full faith and credit in two respects: First, in seeking a part of an estate

207 U.S.

Opinion of the Court.

which has been finally distributed to those who were entitled to it under the will; and, second, infixing a personal responsibility for the tax upon the executors who had been conclusively exonerated from such a liability.
Up to this point it has been assumed that the New Jersey court had jurisdiction to probate the will and administer the estate, and what has been said upon the effect of the judicial proceedings has been based upon .that assumption. When, however, full faith and credit is demanded -for a judgment in the courts of other States, an inquiry into the jurisdiction is always permitted, and if it be shown that the proceedings relied upon were without the jurisdiction of the court, they need not be respected. Thompson v. Whitman, 18 Wall. 457; Thormann v. Frame, 176 U. S. 350, and -cases cited.
The defendant in error, acting upon this well-settled rule, might have attacked the jurisdiction of the New Jersey courts, and thus brought forward for consideration many important questions which, in the view we take of the case, need not even. be dtated. But there was no attempt, except in argument here, to deny the right of the New Jersey court to act upon the paper writing purporting to dispose of the estate of Tilt, and by admitting it to probate to convert it into an operative will. It ia'true that, as a basis of assessing transfer taxes, it was proved that Tilt was a resident of. New York at the time of his death, a fact which would be relevant to the question 'ofjuris-. diction. But that fact was not proved or used. for the purpose, of invalidating the proceedings taken in probating the will and administering 'the estate. On the contrary, the taxes were .based upon the provisions of the instrument, which derived all its authenticity as a will and all its capacity to transmit property 'from the judicial proceedings in New Jersey. It appears conclusively from the action taken in the New York Surrogates' Court that there was no attempt to declare the New Jersey proceedings void because they were taken without jurisdiction. In the appraiser's report 'it is said that the deceased had left a.will "which was duly admitted to probate in

the Surrogate's Court of the county of Morris, State of New Jersey, and that letters testamentary were issued by said Surrogate Court." The specific legacies and the disposition of the residue of the estate were then stated. The Surrogate, in assessing the taxes, assessed them specifically on the beneficiaries, giving their respective names and the values of the property they respectively took under the will. Two life estates and several remainders, -created by the will, were valued appropriately and the taxes assessed accordingly. All this is utterly inconsistent with an attack upon the jurisdiction, and we need not consider whether it could have been made with
success. It is quite obvious that what was done here was the assess-
ment by one State of taxes upon transfers of personal property, taking effect under the laws of another State, entirely regardless of the situs of the property transferred. This suggests grave constitutional questions, which we cannot consider because they were not properly and seasonably raised in the court below.
For the foregoing reasons we think that the judgment below denied to the New Jersey proceedings the full faith and credit to which they were entitled by the Constitution and laws of the United States, and accordingly it is
Reversed.

APPEALS FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF

Nos. 12, 388. Argued October 15, 1907.-Decided December 2, 1907.
In an accounting for attorneys' fees for collection of claims against the Government this court followed the general rule of affirming a finding of fact made and confirmed by both the courts below unless the same is clearly erroneous and held that certain services were of the character generally designated as lobbying services and could not be allowed.
Where an administrator of an attorney performs services and incurs expenses in completing the business in which his intestate and another attorney were interested he should be allowed therefor and those services and expenses as well as those rendered and incurred by the intestate can be settled in one suit where the account has been treated by both parties as one account.
Where one interested in attorney fees for collection of government claims can expect nothing until the amount adjudged has been appropriated, laches will not be charged against him if he bring the suit for an accounting within a reasonable period after the passage of the appropriation act. In this case two years was not unreasonable.
A decree of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia reversing the Supreme Court of the District as to some of the findings of fact and conclusions of law and directing a new decree to be entered in accordance with the opinion is not a final decree and an appeal will not lie therefrom to this court.
THE appeals in the above numbers involve the judgment of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia (25 App. D. C. 582, sub nom. Waggaman v. Earle), which modified the decree of the Supreme Court confirming the report of an auditor. The action was brought by the appellees against the administrator of Earle's estate for an accounting, and after issue joined it was referred to an auditor to state the account upon the pleadings and proof placed before him. The auditor reported in favor of allowing the complainant as due the Causten estate the sum of $7,462.20. After the report had been confirmed by

Statement of the Case.

the Supreme Court, each side took an appeal and the Court of .Appeals reversed some of the findings and conclusions of law of the court below, and directed a new decree to be entered,
in accordance with the opinion of the court. The defendants appealed from that order to this court, and that appeal is the above number 12.
Fearing that there might be some doubt as to the finality of this decree for the purpose of an appeal to this court, the parties, pursuant to the decree of the Court of Appeals, took the case down to the trial court, which referred it to the auditor, who restated the account in accordance with the direction of the Court of Appeals, to which exceptions were filed by the defendant, which were overruled, the auditor's report confirmed and another decree entered, from which an appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals and there affirmed, and from the decree of affirmance an appeal has been taken to this court and allowed, which is number 388.
The material facts which appear in the record are the following: For many years a series of attempts had been made to secure legislation from Congress looking to the payment of claims made by American citizens for damages arising from illegal seizure of their vessels by the government of France, which the United States had, by treaty, undertaken to pay. Such attempts had been unsuccessful, until at length an act was possed by Congress, chapter 25 of the Laws of 1885 (23 Stat. 283), which provided for the ascertaining of claims of American citizens for spoliation prior to the thirty-first of July, 1801.
During quite a number of years preceding the act of 1885 one James H. Causten, a resident of the District of Columbia, had accumulated papers, which were regarded as of considerable value in facilitating proofs of these claims. Mr Causten died before the passage of the act of Congress, leaving these papers in the hands of Mr. William E. Earle, who was also interested in the prosecution of said claims; and therefore desired the benefit of the use of these papers, and after the act of Congress Mr. Earle and Mr. Waggaman, the administrator of the estate

207 U. S.

of Mr. Causten, entered into a contract as of the date of June 12, 1885, by which Mr. Earle was to -be allowed to continue in the
possession and exclusive use of. these papers in the prosecution of the spoliation claims, for which possession and exclusive use he was to pay to the administrator (Waggaman) twentyfive per centum of all fees which he should receive on account of these claims, "after deducting from all such fees received, or which shall hereafter be received by him, the proper.expenses incurred by him, since the passage of the act of Congress referring said cases to the Court of Claims in the prosecution of said French spoliation claims, such as clerk hire, printing, advertising) office rent, and the compensation of other attorneys necessarily associatea with him, and in whose compensation said Earle does not share. And settlements between said Earle and said Waggaman, administrator as aforesaid, or his successor in office, shall be made every six months, and the proportionate part of said fees due said administrator shall be paid over to said administrator or his successor in .office, at such settlement."
Earle agreed to keep true books of account of all fees and retainers received by him, and also of all expenses attending the prosecution of the claims in which he should be engaged as counsel or otherwise, the books of account to be open at all times for the inspection of the administrator, or his successor in office.
.Thereafter proceedings were taken by Earle in the Court of Claims towards proving the claims of his clients, and the action of that court recognizing such claims among others, to a certain extent, was certified to Congress, as provided in the act of 1885.
On March 3, 1891 (26 Stat. 897), Congress made an appropriation in payment of a portion of all claims so certified, and out of this appropriation Mr. Earle received as fees up to July, 1893, the sum of about $38,000, while his books showed tn expenditure of over $57,000, leaving Mr. Earle some $18,000 behind. Future legislation was expected, which would turn

Opinion of the Court.

this deficit into a profit. It was hoped that a further appropriation would be made in 1893, but that hope was not realized. Mr. Earle died in August, 1893, and an administrator was thereafter appointed. No further appropriation was made until August 3, 1899 (30 Stat. 1161, 1191). Under this appropriation the estate of Earle received some $&0,000 in fees.
Negotiations for the settlement of the accounts between the administrator of Earle's estate and the administrator of Causten's estate were proceeded with, but proved unsuccessful, when this suit was instituted by the Causten administrator for an accounting. Pleadings were had in due form, and the oase was referred to an auditor of the court for a statement of the account, who, after considerable testimony had been adduced, filed his report and found the sum of $7,462.20 tk be due from the defendant to the complainant. Exceptions were filed by both parties, vhich were overruled by the Supreme Court, and the auditor's report was confirmed.
The Court of Appeals modified the decree entered by the Supreme' Court, as already stated.

MR. JUSTICE PECKHAM, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court.

In making up the account the representative of the Earle estate claimed a credit for the sum of $19,558.05 as part of the proper expenses incurred by or in behalf of defendant in obtaining the appropriations above mentioned. The auditor struck out $13,058.05 of such claimed credit, leaving $6,500 as a proper credit in favor of the administrator of Earle. The thirteen thousand and some odd dollars were stricken out by the auditor because of the fact, as he found, that these moneys

OCTOBER TERM, 1907.

Opinion of the Court.

207 U. S.

were paid for lobbying services, in efforts to secure the appropriation by Congress, which services he held were contrary to public policy and discountenanced by the courts, and therefore not to be allowed as a proper credit. The balance,. $6,500, the auditor held that the proof showed had been paid by the defendant for legal services by the individuals named, and that such services were valuable, and the amount paid was not excessive or unreasonable. This amount consisted of three separate items, two items for $2,000 and one item for $2,500.
Upon the argument in the Court of Appeals the defendants' counsel insisted that the .whole nineteen thousand dollars should have been allowed as a proper credit, while the plaintiff's counsel asserted that the disallowance of the thirteen thousand dollar credit was right, but that the court erred in admitting the $6,500 as a proper credit. The Court of Appeals, as we have said, affirmed that portion of the decree in which the auditor disallowed the thirteen. thousand dollars clainied for credit, but reversed that portion of the decree by which the auditor allowed the credit of $6,500) and directed the decree to be amended by striking out the above credit for that sum. This was upon the ground that the $6,500 claimed was also illegal. The court said that it was impossible to read the record without coming to the conclusion that these alleged services were of the kind known as lobbying services; that, although proof on the subject was meager, yet so far as it went it tended unmistakably to show the illicit character of the services, being personal influence and personal solicitation with members of Congress,' and that courts had branded services of a like nature as improper, and for which no recovery would be allowed.
The auditor before whom the case was tried and who heard the witnesses, while holding that certain of the credit claims wire illegal as claims for lobbying services, yet held that these particular claims for services performed by members of the bar, and representing the $6,500 allowed, were for proper professional services, and as such should be allowed. The Supreme

EARLE v. MYERS.

207 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Court of the District confirmed the report of the auditor, and thereby held that the credit claimed for the payment of these
services was proper. After a careful examination of the testimony in the case we
are unable to concur with the Court of Appeals on this question. We cannot find any evidence to justify a reversal of the report of the auditor, confirmed as it is by the Supreme Court. The payments were proved to have been made, and there is no evidence of any illegality connected with the services performed sufficient to justify an appellate tribunal in reversing the finding of the auditor and the Supreme Court upon this question
of fact. It is unnecessary to embody in this opinion a reference
to the testimony in the case or to make extracts therefrom, but it is enough to say that we are satisfied, from a careful perusal thereof, that we are right in the conclusions which we have come to.
As to the thirteen thousand dollar credit which the auditor and the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals have all disallowed, we are of the opinion that there was sufficient evidence to justify its disallowance. The evidence would seem to justify the finding of the auditor that these particular services thus
paid for were of the character generally designated as lobbying services, and in such case it is proper to follow the general rule of affirming a finding of fact made and.confirmed by the courts below, unless the same be clearly erroneous.
Again, the auditor disallowed in part a claim of some fifteen thousand dolars, which the defendants assert was paid to two other attorneys for their services, under a special agreement which was made between the administrator of the Earle estate and such attorneys. The auditor made a finding of the facts in regard to such employment, and carefully considered th conditions as they appeared in the proof, and stated that he was of the opinion that -the services in question did not require the time and attention of these three gentlemen, and that it would not be just to impose the burden of the payment to them upon this case in such a manner as to diminish the small

207 U.8.

amou t which would be found due and payable to the complainant. He therefore in the account allowed a credit for but one-half of the amount; which he said was in his "judgment a liberal allowance for the present account." Counsel for the defendants have failed to show from the evidence in the record that this item was improperly disposed of by the auditor.
As to the alleged laches on the part of the complainant in bringing this suit, we think the courts below have committed no error in their judgments. The evidence showed that during the time of the life of Mr. Earle, although the books of account were quite meager, yet such as there were had been examined by the administrator of Causten, in the office of Mr. Earle, and that objection had been made to the payment of the moneys to these persons in regard to whom the charge of lobbying services was made. There was no account stated, and the failure to bring suit for an accounting until January, 1901, two years after the appropriation act of 1899, from which payment might be made, cannot be regarded as laches to prevent a recovery in this suit.
The objection that there was in reality no liability on the original contract arising out of"services performed by the administrator after the death of William E. Earle cannot be sustained. The accounting has been treated by both parties as one proper to be made for the whole period, including that which elapsed subsequently to the death of Mr. Earle. The defendant recognized this right by making the accounting not only for fees received prior to the death of Mr. Earle, but for such fees as were received under the appropriation act of 1899. The account presented by the Earle estate to the Causten estate admits an indebtedness due from the administrator of the former of something over $2,000, and the account purports to be one between the estate of Earle and the estate of Causten, and it embraces not only fees received by William E. Earle in his lifetime under the appropriation act of 1891, but fees received by the estate of Earle under. the appropriation act of 1899. Thus both parties seem to have treated the account as

Syllabus.

one account, with reference to the act of 1891 and also to that of 1899, and we think that under the circumstances the defendants should beheld liable to account therefor as indicated.
The account should be restated by allowing credit to the defendant of $6,500, the amount paid the attorneys as already stated. As to all other matters, the decree is right. The proper disposition of the case is to dismiss the appeal in No. 12, because the decree appealed from is not a final one, and to reverse the decree in No. 388, for the purpose of making the proper credit to defendants in the account.

LIPPHARD v. HUMPHREY.
ERROR TO AND APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
No. 188. Argued March 20, 1908.-Decided April 6,1908.
Inability to read does not create a presumption that a testator does not know the contents of a paper declared by him to be his last will and duly executed as such.
There is a presumption that the testator does know the contents of a will properly executed, which, while not conclusive, must prevail in the absence of proof of fraud, undue influence or want of testamentary capacity, even where testator's inability to read is proved.
In the absence of proof of want of testamentary capacity at the date of the will, declarations of the testator as to the contents thereof are inadmissible to prove lack of knowledge of such contents.
28 App. D. C.355, affirmed.
LORAINE LIPPHARD, of the District of Columbia, died December 9, 1903, leaving a paper writing purporting to be her last will and testament, bearing date April 27, 1898, duly attested by -three witnesses, and naming Rev. Mr. Meador as executor.
Decedent left surviving her as her next of kin and sole heirs at law her husband, Adolph F. Lipphard, Sr.; three sons, named John, William A. and Adolph F. Lipphard, Jr.; two daughters, named Sophia L. Hellen, born Lipphard, and Capitola L. Anderson, born Lipphard; sixteen grandchildren, four of whom were infants under the age of 21 years. All the other of her heirs and next of.kin were of lawful age.
Decedent's property consisted of a small quantity of personal property valued at $350 and some real estate valued at $10,000.
The husband, Adolph F. Lipphard, Sr., and two of the sons, William A. and Adolph F. Lipphard, Jr., filed a caveat to the probate of the will. All of the other next of, kin and heirs at law became parties in one way or another. Before the issues were framed on the caveat the Rev. Mr. Meador departed this fife. Thereupon decedent's daughters, Capitola L. Anderson

and Sophia L. Hellen, beneficiaries under the writing, petitioned the court for leave to propound said paper writing as and for the last will of decedent, and an order was passed by the court below authorizing this to be done. Thereafter a decree was passed framing issues upon the caveat to be tried by a jury. The issues were five in number and were as follows:
"1. Was the paper writing dated April 27, 1898, the last will and testament of said Loraine Lipphard?
"2. Was the said writing executed and attested in due form, as required by law?
"3. At the time of the execution of said paper writing, was
the said Loraine Lipphard of sound and disposing mind and capable of making a valid deed or contract?
"4. Was said writing procured by fraud or undue influence, practiced upon her by any person or persons?
"5. Was the signature of tl~e said Loraine Lipphard procured by force exercised upon her by any person or persons?"
Barnard, J., presiding.at the trial of the issues, directed the jury to find the third, fourth and fifth issues in favor of the caveatees, on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to warrant the jury in finding a verdict thereon in favor of the caveators. The first and second issues were submitted to the jury with instructions by the court to the. effect that unless the jury believed that the contents of the paper were known to testatrix at the time of execution, they should find for the caveators. If, however, they should find from the evidence that testatrix did know the contents of the paper and did sign the same by her mark in the presence of witnesses, who signed the same as witnesses in her presence, the verdict should be in favor of the caveatees. The jury found the issues in favor of the caveatees, and the will was accordingly admitted to probate and record May 3, 1906.
From this decree the -caveators appealed to the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, which affirmed the decree of the Supreme Court of the District (28 App. D. C. 355), and thereupon the case was brought to this court.

OCTOBER TERM, 1907.

Statement of the Case.

209 U. S.

The paper writing in controversy was witnessed by three credible witnesses, all of whom testified as witnesses for the caveatees. From their testimony it appeared that on the twenty-seventh day of April, 1898, Mrs. Loraine Lipphard brought the writing to the office of Miss Parker, one of the attesting witnesses, with whom she had long been acquainted, and told her that it was her last will and testament, and that she wanted it attested by three witnesses., Two other witnesses with whom she was also acquainted, one of them for forty years, were procured, and all three being present, testatrix declared the paper writing to be her will and signed it by her mark thereto in the presence of all, the witnesses, and they signed their names thereto as attesting witnesses in her presence. The testatrix was at the time of sound mind and capable of making a valid deed or will. The will was not read in the presence of the witnesses, and After the testatrix had subscribed her "mark" and the will had been witnessed, it was handed to her and she took it away with her. After Mrs. Lipphard's death the will was produced by Rev. Mr. Meador and given by him to jn attorney, who lodged it in the office of the register of wills.
Evidence was adduced on the trial on behalf of the caveators that Mrs. Lipphard could not read or write; that she was a licensed midwife and had a great number of cases; that the title to the real estate devised by the will was originally in her husband; that in March, 1857, he put a trust on the property, and it was subsequently sold thereunder; that he afterward took title to the property and again it was sold, and then the title was taken in the wife's name. The husband's testimony tended to show that he was improvident. Testatrix was an energetic woman and a good wife. Part of the property when purchased was vacant land. In 1894 this land was improved by two. houses. Testatrix made the contract for the erection of these houses and attended to the building of the.same. The husband and wife had lived happily together for sixty-five years.

When once the foundation has been laid by proving that the alleged testator was illiterate, and could not read or write or sign his name, or that it was doubtful from any other cause whether he knew the contents of the will, the declarations of the alleged testator are admissible in evidence to show whether he knew or did not know, the contents and provisions of the alleged will.

Mr. B. F. Leighton and Mr. C. Clinton James for defendants in error and appellees.

MR. CHIEF JUSTIcE FULLER, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court.

The contention of appellant is that as testatrix could not read, and as the will was not read to her at the time of its execution, it was therefore to be presumed that she did not know the contents of the will when she executed it, or that the jury ought not to have been allowed to presume from the evidence produced before them that the testatrix had knowledge of the contents of the will.
Mrs. Lipphard brought the will with her to the office of one of the attesting witnesses for the purpose of execution, and after its execution took it away with her, and at her death it appeared in. the possession of the Rev. Mr. Meador, the executor named therein, and by whom it was propounded for probate and record. She declared to the witnesses that it was her will, and requested them to attest it as such; and its provisions were reasonable and natural. She was shown to be a woman of intelligence and business capacity; she was in bodily and mental health and vigor when the instrument was executed; and there was no suggestion of fraud or undue influence in the case.
In these circumstances the jury properly, concluded that the testatrix knew the contents of the will at the time of its execution, and the court might well have directed such finding, unless the bare fact of the inability of testatrix to read raised a legal, presumption that she did not possess that knowledge, and the absence of the reading of the will to her at that time was fatal. But we know of no such presumption as mat-

ter of law, and on the contrary, the presumption where a will is properly signed and executed is that the testator knows the oontents. Where there is evidence of the practice of fraud or of undue influence, affirmative proof of knowledge of the contents may be necessary, but not so in any other case, simply because of a presumption arising from inability to read. Taylor v. Creswell, 45 Maryland, 422, 431; Vernon v. Kirk, 30 Pa. St. 224; King v. Kinsey, 74 N. C. 261; Hoshauer v. Hoshauer, 26 Pa. St. 404; Clifton v. Murray, 7 Georgia, 565; Doran v. Mullen, 78 Illinois, 342; Walton v. Kendick, 122 MissQuri, 504; Nickerson v. Buck, 12 Cush. 341; Guthrie v. Price, 23 Arkansas, 407.
In the latter case testatrix's name was subscribed to the will, and between her Christian and surname was her mark in the form of a cross. The attesting witnesses signed the will at her request, in her presence, and in the presence of each other. She produced the paper writing for them to attest and declared that it was her will, and that she desired them to witness it as such. She did not write her name, but made her mark to the paper. It was not shown who did write her name to the will. It was not written by either of the witnesses, nor in their presence. Testatrix could not read, and the will was not read to her in the presence of or to the knowledge of the witnesses. The trial court instructed the jury, in effect, that notwithstanding the will was executed in accordance with the formalities prescribed by the statute, yet it being shown that the testatrix could not read, the will was invalid, unless it was -proved that it was read to her and that she was informed as to its contents. After a review of the authorities, the Supreme Court of Arkansas held such instruction to be erroneous, and Chief Justice English, in the concluding part of his opinion, said:
"It was proven that she could not read, and it was not
shown that the will was read to her at the time it was executed, but it may have been before. She produced the will herself, declared it to be her will, asked the witnesses to attest it as

such, signed it by making her mark. She was a woman of good sense, particular about her business transactions, and manifested her usual soundness of mind at the time. It is not shown that she was laboring under any feebleness of mind from disease, or approaching dissolution. The provisions of her will appear to be reasonable. It is not shown that any imposition was practiced upon her, or that her sons, had any agency in the preparation of the will. It was erroneous for the court to tell the jury as a matter of law that it being shown that she could not read, it was necessary to prove that the will was read to her. They had the right to infer, from all of
the circumstances, that she knew the contents of the will, though, as shown by the authorities above quoted, in determining whether there was fraud or imposition in the execution
of the will, the fact that she could not read, and that the will was not read to her, at the time she signed it, were circum-
stances to be considered by the jury." True, the presumption that a party signing a will by mark,
or otherwise, knows its contents, is not a conclusive presumption, but it must prevail in the absence of proof of fraud, undue influence, or want of testamentary capacity attending the execution of the will. In the present case there was no attempt to show that the testatrix was not capable of making a valid deed or contract at the date of making the will; on the contrary, the evidence showed that she was a Woman of energy, capacity and intelligence. Nor was any proof offered of fraud or undue influence in the production of the will. Mrs. Lipphard brought the will, as we have said, to Miss Parker's office for the purpose of having it executed; she declared to the attesting witnesses the paper to which she made her mark to be her last will and testament. She was a person of sound mind at the date of the will, and it was executed and attested in the manner required by statute.
It is obvious that the verdict of the jury ought not to be disturbed and a new trial allowed, unless some reversible error was committed in the course of the trial, and appellants insist

Opinion of the Court.

that such error existed in the exclusion of evidence of declarations alleged to have been made by the testatrix prior and subsequent to the date of her will as to how she intended to dispose, or had disposed, of her property.
Decedent's husband testified that his wife talked to him often, prior.to theodate of the will, as to what she intended to do with her property after her death, and that they talked the matter over after the date of the will. He was asked what she said, but objection to the question was sustained. Appellants did not state what they expected to prove by the hus-
band. Albert R. Humphrey, another witness, testified that he had
a conversation with Mrs. Lipphard about two years before she died. He was asked the following questions:
"Did she tell you how she had left her property, or how she was goihg to leave it? A. Yes, sir.
"What did she say to you in reference to that matter?" To which caveatees objected, and the court sustained the
objection. Counsel for appellants stated that he desired to show by this witness that testatrix denied leaving the property as mentioned in the will, this being more than three years after the will was executed.
William A. Lpphard, one of the caveatees, was asked a similar question, and, upon objection, the court made a like ruling, excluding the evidence. He said that he had a conversation with her in reference to her will just before her death; that she told him how she had left her property.
Mrs. Sarah Lipphard, the wife of one of the caveatees, testi-
fied that eight or ten weeks before decedent died she asked her if she had made a will, and then she was asked the following
question: "What did she say in reference to what was in her will and
what she had done with her property, if anything?" On objection by the caveatees the evidence was 'excluded.
Counsel for caveators stated to the court that he desired to show by this witness that testatrix had denied to the witness

OCTOBER TERM, 1907.

Opinion of the Court.

209 U. S.

that she had left her property as and in the manner stated in the will. . Appellants' brief asserts that the offer was made in support of the issue of want of mental capacity in the testatrix at the time she made her will.
In Stevens v. Vancleve, 4 Wash. C-C.262, 265; S. C., 23 Fed. Cases, 35, Mr. Justice Washington said that declarations of a deceased, prior or subsequent to the execution of a will, were nothing more than hearsay, and that there was nothing more dangerous than their admission, either to control the construction of the instrument or to support or destroy its validity. . In Throckmorton v. Holt, 180 U. S. 573, Mr. Justice Peckham,
speaking for the court, expressed the opinion, after much consideration, that the principles upon which our law of evidence is founded necessitated the exclusion of such evidence, both before and after the execution, saying:
"The declarations are purely hearsay, being merely unsworn declarations, and when no part.of the res gestox are not within any of the recognized exceptions admitting evidence of that kind.
"Although in some of the cases the remark is made that declarations are admissible which tend to show the state of the affections of the deceased as a mental condition, yet they are generally stated in cases where the mental capacity of the deceased is the subject of the inquiry, and in those cases his declarations on that subject are just as likely to aid in answering the question as to mental capacity as those upon any other subject. But if the matter in issue be not the mental capacity of the deceased, then such unsworn declarations, as indicative of the state of his affections, are no more admissible than would be his unsworn declarations as to any other fact.

"When such an issue (one of mental capacity) is made it is one which relates to a state of mind which was involuntary, and over which the deceased had not the control of the sane individual, and his declarations are admitted, not as any evi-

.209 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

dence of their truth, but only because he made them, and that is an original fact from which, among others, light is sought to be reflected dpon the main issue of testamentary'capacity.

"It is quite apparent, therefore, that declarations of the deceased are properly received upon the question of a state of mind, whether mentally strong and capable, or weak and incapable, and that from all the testimony, including his declarations, his mental capacity can probably be determined with considerable accuracy."
And see In re Kennedy, 167 N. Y. 163, 176. In Shailer v. Bumstead, 99 Massachusetts, 123, it was ruled:
"Where a foundation is laid by evidence tending to show a previous state of mind, and its continued existence past the, time of the execution of the will is attempted to be proved by subsequent conduct and declarations, such declarations are admissible, provided they are significant of a condition sufficiently permanent, and are made so near the time as to afford a reasonable inference that such was the state at the time in question."
In the present case no foundation was laid for the admission of this evidence. Not a syllable of testimony was adduced by appellants to'-show want of testamentary capacity at the date of the will. For aught the record shows, she retained her mental powers up to the time of her death, which took place five years and eight months after making her will.
As we have said, appellants did not state what they.. expected to prove by decedent's husband, nor what they expected to prove by the evidence of William A. Lipphard. This witness testified on cross-examination that he did not know his mother had made a will until after her death. In his direct examination he stated that she told him, in a conversation had with her a week before she died, how she had disposed of her property by her will.
And so the offer to prove by Albert R. Humphrey, that the testatrix two years prior to hcr death, and more than
VOL. ccIx-1

three years after the execution of the will, denied giving her property, as provided by her will, or the-similar offer made with respect to the witness Mrs. Sarah Lipphard, wife of Adolph Lipphard, as to alleged conversations with decedent eight or
ten weeks before her death, were at a period too remote to throw any light upon the mental condition of the testatrix at the time the will was made.
There was no evidence whatever of mental incapacity and this particular evidence was too remote to justify any reasonable inference to that effect, and if there was no lack of mental capacity, then this evidence would have no tendency to show
that she did not have knowledge of the contents of the will when she executed it and declared it to be her last will and testament. Because she may have resisted importunity for information in respect to what she had done, three years after she had made het will, it does not follow that she did not know the contents of the will when she made it. There must be some other proof, some suspicious circumstances, some evidence of fraud or undue influence before evidence of conversations years after the execution of the will should be admitted to show that she did not know what she was doing when she made it.
Decree affirmed.

Harrio v. Ma 'oon,U2.08S.,501, foblowed to effect that the act of March 3, 1905, e. 1465, 33 Stat. 1035, did not operate retroactively and that this
court has no authority to review judgments o.f the S upreme Court of Hawall; rendered prior to that date, which cotdd not be reviewed under the previous act. In this case it was held that the writ of error could not be sustained as to the judgment referred to therein because entered prior t0 March 3, 1905, and also that it could not be sustitned as to a judgment in thq same suit entered after the writ ofterror had been sued out.
TEm facts are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Robert M. Mor8e, with whom Mr. William M. Richard8on, Mr. Sidney M. Ballou and Mr. J.J. Dunne were-on the brief, for plaintiffs in error:
It is conceded'.that the. plaintiffs in error proceeded at the outset: on the assumption that the decision of the Supreme Court of Hawaii of March 8, 1904, overruling the plaintiffs' exceptions, was the final judgment in the case, and that the United States statute of 1905 had a retroactive effect and entitled the plaintiffs-in.error to come into this court on a writ of error to reverse that judgment. In fact, however, the decision of the Hawaiian court on the bill of exceptions. was not a final judgment, and -that.court Could not enter a final judg·ment before the Hawaiian act of 1905. ..Even if it had been oi could be :considered to be a final ,judgment, the decision of' this court in HarriSonv. Magoon, 205 U. S. 501,'to the effect ' that -the United States statute of 1905 was not retroactive Would'deprive this court .of jurisdiction. SIt appears,. however, that on June 8, 1905, a judgment, and.

the first judgment in-this case entered by any court, was entered in the Circuit Court of Hawaii and that the plaintiffs in error thereupon applied to the Supreme Court of Hawaii for a writ of error to the Circuit Court, which writ of error was granted under. date of November 24, 1905, -and, on motion by. defendants in error. to quash the same, Was dismissed April 13, 1906, and that -judgment thereon was entered September 27; 1907, as of A ril 13, 1906. *This judgment of the Hawaiian court was, in effect, an affirmance of the judgment of the Circuit Court, and was, for the' purpose of a writ of errr'to this court, a final judgment in the case by the Supreme Court of Hawaii.
-The entire record of the case is now before -this court, and
if it appears from inspection of the record that substantial
errorhas been committed, to which seasonable objection was -taken by the plaintiffs' in error, this court has the power, to correct and wtl correct such error. Gregory v. McVeijh, 23 Wall. 294; Fiher v. Perkins, 122 U.S, 522.
The court maytreat the phrase, March 8, 1904, not as the particular date of the judgment, biit as descriptive only and'' surplusage, and will' give effect to the apparent intention of the plaintiffs in error to enforce their right to a review of the final judgment in the case by thehighest court of the Territory.
The power of the court to review does' not depend upon the
presence or absence ofany specific assignment of error. World's Columbian Exposition Co. v. Republic of France, 91 Fed. Rep.
64. Rule 35 of the Supieme Court is to the effect that the courtf
will notice plain errors, even though not assigned, and' this codrt has frequently considered sich.errors.. United States v. Pena, i75 U. S. 500, and eVei when no assignment of errors has been filed. Farrarv..ChurchiU, 135 U. S. 609; Behn. v.
Campbel, 205 U.. S.403.
It may be claimed, however, that .'because the judgment of the Hawaiian court was the quashingof a writ of error oni a motion'to, dismiss, it was not such a; judgment as can beVe-

'NOTLEY v,, BROWN.

viewed by this court. No limitation as to the kind or character .of the judgment to'.be entered is imposed by act of C'ongress of 1905, or by the Hawaiian act of '1905; and it is therefore'to.,be assumed that the same rules and practice' are to -prevail" * as in cases between Federal and state courts. See Williams v. Brufly; 102 U. S. 248.
The test as to 'what constitutes a final judgment to which a writ of error can be taken is whether in bntering such judgment the court was affirming or rejecting a claim which .the plaintiff in error sought to enforce as a matter of right, or whether it was one Which the court in the exercise of its dis-
cretion might allow or not. Walden-v. Craig, 9 Wheat. 510; Pickett's Heirs v. Legerwood, 7 Peters, i42; Shreve v. Cheesman, 69 Fed. Rep. 785; Wh'itworth v. United States, 11 Fed. Rep. .302.
In. the case at bar the plaintiffs' in error claimed the right · to a review of the judgment of June 8, 1905, as. a matter of right, and set out nine assignments of error, each raising questions of law. Nothing but questions of law were therefor.e before the Supreme Court of the Trritory. Therefore, its judgment in dismissing the writ of error, which, as we have said, is equivalent to a decree of affirmance, is reviewable by thii court.
Judgment dismissing the writ of error was in fact entered Seltember 27, 1907, but of the date of April [3, 1906. This case falls within the United States act of 1905.
Where a law conferring jurisdiction is repealed without any reservation as to -pending ease , all cases fall within the law. Railroad Co. v. Grant, 98.U. S..398; Gurnee v. PatrickCounty, 137 U. S.'141. The converse must also be true, that, where a law granting jurisdiction ise.nacted without any reservation, all pending cases fall within the law.
Even if.the writ of error can bing up only the proceedings in the Hawaiian -courts subsequent to the entry of judgment of June 8, 1905, the writ should be sustained as the Supreme .Court of the Territory in dismissing the writ of error did so upon the ground that all the errors assigned in the petition had

been passed on by it on March 8,1904. But the sixth, and .seventh assignments relate to 'the* proceedings in the lower court had since March 8, 1904, and therefore could not have been passed upon by the appellate court.

Mr. Aldi8 B. Brouwe. and Mr. W. L. Stanley, with whom
Mr.Alexander Briton and Mr. Henry Holmes were on the brief,
for defendants in error: The act of March 3, i905, needs no interpretation with re-
spect to the point here involved. By its express language it takes effect and operates only "from and after its passage."
The final judgment whereof review is.here sought was rendered long before its passage. Admittedly no provision for review thereof in this court then existed. No time lifit for
appeal or review in any higher court was provided. The cause was at an end.
Nor can the act be given retroactive effect in authorizing.
review of a judgment theretofore made final in the Supreme Court of Hawaii. White v. United States, 191 U. S. 545, 552. See also United States v. AmerIcan Sugar Refining Co., 202 U. S.563; Hooker v. Hooker, 10 S. & M. (Miss.) 599, 601; Stewart v. Davidson,10 S. &M. (Miss.) 351, 358.
While the legislative power to enlarge or restrict remedies exists, it is clearly limited to causes which are then pending, and not to those wherein there has been final judgment and the parties hence dismissed, and with the cause thus put at judicial end. Jensen et al. v. Friee et t., 113 Illinois, 171, 175; Willoughby'v. George, 5 Colorado, 80, 82; Davis v. Menasha, 21 Wisconsin, 491; Merrillv. Sherburne, 1 N. H. 199; Bates v. Kimball, Admr., 2 Chipman (Vt.), 77; Lewis v. Webb, 3 Maine, 326.
So in the case at bar, under the operation of the final judgment 44 the Supreme Court of Hawaii, -now here sought to be reviewed, the rights of the parties-became fixed and the property.had. become subject to the absolute and final disposition
prescribed in the res ator's will. With that property and the

I. 324.

MR. JUSTICE WmTE delivered the opinion of the court.
In a contest in a Hawaiian court of probate certain documents were held not to have been executed under undue influence, and were admitted to .probate as the last will and testament and codicils thereto of Charles Notley. On appeal to the Circuit Court, in term, upon motion of the contestants, a jury was impanelled. to try issues of fact embodied in two questions, which substantially required the jury to say whether undue influence had been exerted upon the testator. 0 the trial various exceptions were taken to rulings on the admission and rejection of evidence, and ,at the close of the evidence the trial judge granted a motion to instruct the jury to find a ver-, dict sustaining the will.
The verdict was rendered January 28, 1903. On the same day the trial judge signed the following order, which was duly filed on the following day:

"Order for Entering up Judgment.
"Upon the entering up of the verdict on the appeal in this matter,
"It is hereby ordered that the clerk of'this court do sign and
enter up judgment in favor of proponents of the last will and testament of Charles Notley, deceased, in accordance with said. verdict, and' the decree admitting said will and codicils to, probate is.hereby affirmed.
"Done in open court at Hilo this 28th day of January, 1903."On.January 27, 1903, the clerk endorsed and filed a formal judgment. It would seem, however, that he did not then sign

the face of the judgment, and perhaps did not enter it, as fol-
lowing the date of the judgment is this recital: "A. S., Le Baron Gurney, Clerk. Fourth Circuit Court. "Judgment entered this .28th day of January, 1903. "(Seal) This 8th day of June, A. D. 1905, as of the 28th day
of January, 1903." The following endorsement is also on the back of the judg-
ment,-under the endorsement of the filing on January 29, 1903: "Filed June 8, 1905. A. S. Le Baron Gurney, Clerk." The record is silent as to how these additions to -the judgment came to be made.
A motion to set aside the verdict and for a new trial having been overruled, the cause was taken on exceptions to the Supreme Court of Hawaii. In that court the action of the trial. court in instructing a verdict was sustained and two motions for. a rehearing were overruled, the last on August 2, 1904. 15 Hawaii, 435, 700; S. C., 16 Hawaii, 66.. It will be observed that the last action of the court on the application for a rehearing was had nearly a year prior to the clerk's signature affixed to the face of the judgment on June 8, 1905, as of January 28, 1903, and the additional file mark on the back of the judgment made on June 8, 1905.
More than a year after the final action-of the Supreme Court of the Territory on the exceptions, that is, on November 24, 1905, a petition for a writ of error to the Circuit Court, with assignments of error, was filed in the Supreme Court of the Territory on behalf of the contestants, praying .that court to reverse a judgment entered in the Circuit Court. The petition .for the writ recited the order admitting the will and codicils to probate, the appeal to the Circuit Court, the trial upon specified issues of fact, the motion to direct a verdict, the instruction to sign a certain form of verdict, the verdict, the taking of various exceptions, and the overruling of motiono for a new trial. No reference was made in the petition for a writ of error to the fact that the exceptions reserved at the trial had been previously, taken to the Supreme Court of the

Territory and had been there decided adversely to the contestants. The petition then proceeded to.r'ecite that on June 8, 1905-which; it will b4 observed, waS after the :final action of the Supreme Court on the exceptions-the contestants had in the Circuit Court filed a motion to set asidethe "'Order for: entering judgment,," filed January 29, 1903, upon the ground that the order was obtained ez parte and 'without'notice to or knowledge.of contestants, and said motion was heard. upon
affidavit and oral evidence and was overruled, to. which exception was duly taken, etc. It was further recited that on the same day, while this motion was pending, counsel for P'rpo-, nents moved that the clerk of the court be instructed to sign the judgment which had been previously made out'on. January 28, 1903; and filed on'the. next day, in conformity to .ti6 order of the. court rendered on January 28, 1903,'and that on this motion being granted by the court the 'judgment was entered and signed'by the clerk, and the following exception was taken:
"Contestants except to the' allowance of proponents' motion that the clerk of court be ordered to sign the form of judgment .fled January 29th, 1903, and to the judgment so signed on the ground that such allowance is illegal, null 'and void and not justified by the law or evidence or record herein and to the judgment on the. ground -that said judgment is contrary to the, law and evidence and weight -of evidence and without authority of law and is illegal, null and void.
"Datdd Hilo, June 8th, 1905." The first five of the grounds set forth in the assignment.of errors made for the'purpose of the writ of' error prayed from the Supreme Court of the Territory, .asabove stated, were but a reiteration of alleged errors asserted to have been previously
committed by the trial court in instructing a verdict in favor of' the will, ard which had already been taken to the Supreme Court of the Territory on the-exceptions and had been ad-' versely passed upon by that court. The remaining assigned .errors were as follows:

OCTOBER TERM,' 1907.

Opinion of the Court.-

208 U. S.

"Sixth. That the court erred in making the ex pare order of January 29, 1903, confirming the decree of Judge Little admitting the alleged will of Charles Notley to probate.
"Seventh. That the court erred in denying contestants'
motion to set aside order of Judge Robinson filed January 29, 1903i confirming decree of Judge Little admitting will to probate.
"Eighth. That the court erred in ordering the clerk to sign the form of judgment submitted by proponents. -
"Ninth. That the court erred in entering judgment for the proponents in said matter of the estate of Charles Notley, det ceased, being petition for probate of will."
It may be observed that Judge Little was the judge by whom the will was originally admitted to probate, while Judge Robin-
son was the judge who presided at the trial in the Circuit Court and whose action in instructing a verdict had been approved by the Supreme Court of the Territory. The writ of error from the Supreme Court prayed under the circumstances just stated was allowed on November 24, 1905, and on December 14, 1905, a motion to quash the writ was filed upon the following grounds:
"(1) That it is apparent upon the record that this honorable court has heretofore, to wit, on the 8th day of March, 1904, on the 3rd day of June, 1904, and on the 2nd day of August, 1904, decided the questions now sought to be reviewed and embraced in the assignment of errors filed herein; and
"(2) That the petition for writ of error was not filed nor the writ issued within six months from the rendition of judgment in said 'cause, the same having been rendered and filed on, to wit, the 29th day of January, 1903."
After argument, for reasons stated in an opinion filed April 13, 1906 (17 Hawaiii 455), the Supreme Court of Hawaii granted the motion and dismissed the writ.
Although the court,, in its opinion, declared that there was considerable force in the contention of the defendants in error that the writ should be dismissed, because the only judgment rendered below was that of January 28, 1903, and therefore

NOTLEY v. BROWN.

208 U. S.

Opinion of the Oourt.

that the writ of error had not been sued out within the statutory limit, viz., six months from the rendering of the judgment, it did not rest its conclusion to dismiss upon that ground. The court, reviewing the controversy, held that every substantial question in the case had been already disposed of when the case was previously before it on exceptions.' Without specifically analyzing the assignment of errors based on the action of the trial court on June 8, 1905, in directing the clerk to sign the judgment which had, been made out in pursuance of the order of'the court onl January 28, 1903, those assignments were, in fact, treated as irrelevant or without merit, since it was held that as a*necessary result of the previous action of the court in finally disposing of the exceptions, judgment was requiredt6 be entered upon the verdict by operation of law on notice to the trial court of the overruling of the exceptions.
Although'as we have seen the opinion of the Supreme Court of the Territory just referred to was announced on April 13, 1906, no formal order or judgment in conformity to the opinion delivered by the court quashing the writ was entered. until September 27, 1907. A few days after the delivery by the Supreme Court of the Territory of the opinion referred to, that is, on April. 18, 1906, .three of the contestants served a formal -notice on the. fourth ore, calling upon him to elect whether he would join them in a writ of error to be prosecut9d from this court to the Supreme' Court of the Territory of Hawaii, to obtain a reversal of the judgment of the territorial: court "rendered against you and:us . .. on the eighth day of March, 1904, a motion for rehearing having been heard. and considered, and having been denied on the 3d day of June,' 1904." The contestant thus notified formally replied that. he would not join the other contestants in prosecuting a writ of error to reverse the judgment rendered on March.:8, 1904' Thereupon an application for the allowance of a writ of error from this court was made to the Chief Justice'of the Supreme Court of the Territory. In: a petition for the writ the only

judgment referred to was that claimed to have been rendered by the Supreme Court of the Territory on March 8, 1904, when the case was before that court on the exceptions. In the assignment of errors accompanying the petition it was recited that the final judgment for the reversal of which the writ of error was prayed was that rendered on March 8, 1904, and the three first grounds therein assigned exclusively related to the action of the Supreme Court of the Territory when the case was before that court on exceptions in sustaining the ruling of the trial court, in instructing a verdict. The fourth and last error assigned was as follows:
"Fourth. That the said Supreme Court of the Territory of
Hawaii etred in that the said cause having been remanded to *the Circuit Court of the Fourth Circuit of the Territory of Hawaii after the aforesaid judgment of the Supreme Court, and further proceedings having been taken in said cause in. said Circuit Court anda writ of error dated November 25, 1905, in said cause, having been thereafter sued out by the present plaintiffs in error from the Supreme Court of the Territory of Hawaii to the said Circuit Court, the said Supreme Court quashed said writ of error."
The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Territory having refused to allow the writ on the petition therefor and
assignment of errors heretofore referred to, the writ was allowed by a justice of this court. The transcript of the record was filed in. this court on July 20, 1906.
On November 28, 1906, a motion was made to dismiss the writ of error for want of jurisdiction. In the brief filed on behalf of the defendants in error it was insisted that prior to the act of March 3, 1905 (33 Stat. 135), the power of this court to review the judgments and decrees of courts of the Territory of Hawaii was governed, by the rules relating to the right to' review judgments and decrees of 9tate courts, and that as the cause presented no question which would jqstify a review if the judgment had been rendered in a state court, there was therefore no jurisdiction. It was conceded that a broader and

different right as to the courts of the Territory of Hawaii had been conferred by the act of March 3, 1905, but it was urged that that act did- not confer jurisdiction because the judgment of the Supreme Court of the Territory to vhich the writ of *error was addressed had been rendered prior to the passage of the act of 1905, and as that act had no retroactive effect, there was no jurisdiction. Whilst admitting that the controversy involved no question giving the right to review if the judgment had been rendered in a state court,. and therefore there could be no review under the prior act, plaintiffs in error insisted that there was power to review under the act of March 3, 1905, because that act operated retroactively. The motion was not passed upon, but Was postponed to the hearing on the merits.
At the same term (October term, 1906), however, and some months after the motion to dismiss had been postponed to the hearing upon the merits, the question involved in that motion arose in another case, and it was decided that the act of March 3, 1905, did not operate retroactively, and therefore that this court had no authority to review a judgment or decree of a court of the Territory of Hawaii rendered before the passage of the act which could not be reviewed under the previous act. Harrisonv. Magoon, 205 U. S. 501.
Five months after the decision just referred to in the Magoon case, what is styled a judgment was entered by the Supreme Court of Hawaii, concerning the action of that court in quashing the writ of error from that court to the lower Circuit Court previously referred to. Omitting the title of the cause and the signature of the clerk, the so-called judgment is copied in the margin.'

OCTOBER TERM; 1907.

Opinion otthe Court.

28 U. S.

At the present term, on October 14, 1907, a stipulation of
counsel was filed, adding to the record as omitted matter the petition for a writ of error from the Supreme Court of the Territory, the assignment of errors, the writ of error, the motion to quash the said writ of error, and the so-called judgment of September 27, 1907, quashing the same, to which we have previously referred.
With these facts in mind, we come to consider the controversy. At the outset we must dispose of the motion to dismiss, -which we have previously said was made at the October term, 1906, and was postponed to the hearing on the merits.
As on its face the writ of error in terms is directed to the
supposed judgment of the Supreme Court of Hawaii, rendered March 8, 1904, disposing of the case on exceptions, and there is no pretense of the existence of a Federal question among the
issues arising on the exceptions, it is obvious that as a result of the decision in Hqarrison v. Magoon, supra, we are Without -jurisdiction to review by writ of error the judgment to which
the writ runs. But although the writ. of error is specifically addressed to the judgment of March 8, 1904, and all the grounds previously urged to maintain jurisdiction have been determined to be untenable, it is now pressed that there is jurisdiction upon other and different grounds which are, in fact, wholly incompatible. with those previously taken. Let us consider these grounds.
It is urged that the Supreme Court of Hawaii did not render a judgment in 1904, and indeed it is asserted that that court had no power to render a judgment in passing on a case

ing on to be heard, now after reading and filing said motion to quash said writ of error and after hearing W. L. Stanley, Esq., of counsel for defendants in error in support of said motion, and S. M. Ballou, Esq., of counsel for plaintiffs in error in opposition thereto, and due deliberation having been had, it is
Ordered,-adjudged and decreed that said motion to quash the writ of error -issued herein on the 25th day of November, 1905, be and the same is hereby granted, and that said writ be and it hereby is dismissed.
Dated Honolulu, September 27th, A. D. 1907, as of April 13, 1906.

taken up on exceptions. The claim, therefore, really is that although the judgment to which the writ of error is in terms addressed was no judgment, yet the writ should be sustained. Aside from the contradiction, this contention must rest upon one or two assumptions: 1st. That there was no final judgment susceptible nf being reviewed by a writ of error until June 8, 1905, when, it is asserted, a judgment arose for the first time by the making of an order by the trial court directing the clerk to sign nune pro tune the judgment which had been previously prepared by the clerk in pursuance of the express order of the court in consequence of the irerdict of the jury. Although this' judgment was not only written ip in 1903, but was endorsed filed on January 29, 1903, the argument is that as it was not signed on its face by the clerk when it was so filed it could not take effect as a judgment until the date of the actual signing on its face by that officer as a consequence of the nun pro tune order. 2d. That this writ of error must be treated, despite its terms, as if it were addressed to the action of the Supreme Court of Hawaii in quashing the writ of error -on August 13, 1906.
In considering the first proposition it is to be observed that there is nothing in the record disclosing any ruling by the trial
court concerning the order for the signature nune pro tune of. the judgment or any exception taken to such.a ruling. We say this because, leaving out of view some allusions made to the subject in the opinion of the Supreme Court of the Territory quashing the writ, the only reference to these matters is found in recitals contained in the application to the Supreme Court of. Hawaii for a writ of error, which was stipulated into the record long after the writ in this case was allowed and the record filed here. But waiving any infirmity, and assuming that we may look at mere recitals in the petition fcr the writ of error from the Supreme Court of the Territory, the situation, if the contentions be well founded, is then this, that the only judgment sus'ceptible of being reviewed was one which it was claimed [ was entered in the trial court in connection with the nun pro

tunc entry, after the action of the Supreme Court of the Territory overruling the exceptions, and therefore after -the.judgment of that court which the writ seeks to review. And a consideration of the -second proposition leads to a like result. Conceding that the writ of. error, although it is in terms addressed to the action of the court on th6 exceptions, may now
be treated as being addressed to its action in 1906 in quashing the writ of error, and further conceding, for the sake of argument only, that the judgment' of the territorial court in re-
fusing to consider the case on its merits and quashing the writ of error could, under'any circumstances, be treated as a final judgment susceptible of being reviewed here by writ of error, nevertheless there is. no judgment before us -which we can review., This follows because, as shown by the statement which we have previoL.sly made, at the time when this writ of error was taken no judgment whatever had been entered in the Supreme Court of Hawaii giving formal expression to its decision quashing the writ. Indeed, the judgment so doing was only -entered in- that court, as we have seen, September 27, 1907, long after the record in this case had been filed here and the motion to dismiss the writ had been made and submitted on briefs of counsel and had been postponed to the hearing on the
merits. In fact, no such judgment was entered tintil after th,, decision of.this court in the Magoon case. The argumqent which seeks to have the writ of.error from. this court which is directed to one judgment applied to another rendered long after the writ of error was sued out, can only rest upon the assumption
that the entry of the judgment below in 1907, after the writ of error was sued out, must be treated as relating, back to. the time.in 1906, when'the opinion of the court quashing the writ-
was announced. But if we apply this rule to the judgment in question we .would have to apply it also to the judgment of. the .Hawaiian Circuit Court rendered January- 28, 1903, and
-therefore we should be obliged to say, irrespective.of the reason' assigned by the Supreme Court of the Territory, -that that. court had rightly-quashed .the writ of- error for want of juris-

diction, since.it is conceded that'under the statutes of Hawaii a writ of error must, be sued out within six months from the rendition of judgment.
The considerations just stated' make it inevitable that this writ of error should be dismissed. Of course, it may be that the reasons which we have given do not necessarily foreclose the tight within the statutory time to prosecute a new writ of error to the judgment of the Supreme Court of the Territory of Hawaii, quashing the writ, entered September 27, 1907. On that subject, however, we observe, to the end that this litigation may not be unnecessarily prolonged, that because we do not decide the quest on not before us, as to whether such right to a new writ of error exists, we must not be. considered as in the slightest degree intimating an affirmative view as to the existence of such a right.
