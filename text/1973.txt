United States, "401 U. S. 481, 484 (1971). In that case the formula of Durham-vacating and remanding for dismissal of the judgment-might be the most appropriate remedy in both state and federal cases, saving cases here on certiorari from state courts to be dismissed, since certiorari is in our discretion. But here there was no criminal conviction; the suit in the state court merely involved an attempt to enjoin a criminal prosecution; and there are

MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and MR. JusTICE MARSHALL concur, dissenting.
On the basis of Turner v. Fouche, 396 U. S. 346 (1970), I concur in the dismissal of appellant's facial attack on Georgia's jury selection statutes. However, I would treat. the jurisdictional statement as a petition for certiorari in respect of the second question presented,* see 28 U. S. C. § 2103; Mishkin v. New York, 383 U. S. 502, 512 (1966), and to that extent set the case for oral argument.
Appellant alleges that the application by the jury commissioners of Cdweta County of the Georgia jury selection statutes violated the Fourteenth Amendment in that such application resulted in blacks, women, and
*"Does systematic, intentional and discriminatory exclusion of
Negroes, women and young adults age 18 to 30, from jury service, '.violate Appellant's- rights of Due Process and Equal Protection

BaNNAN, J., dissenting

young adults age 18-30 being underrepresented on the venire from which his grand and petit juries were impaneled. The relevant Georgia. statutes, Ga. Code Ann. §§ 59406, 59-201, require the county' board of jury commissioners, at least biennially, to compile a jury list of "intelligent and upright citizens," who represent a fair cross section of the cointy, to serve as petit jurors. From this list, the commissioners are required to selectthe "most experienced, intelligent, and upright citizens," not exceeding two-fifths of the whole number, to serve as grand jurors.
Appellant, a white male 24 years of age, challenged the array of the grand, and petit juries which indicted and convicted him, on:the ground that the jury list, composing the venire was com'piled in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner. The jury -ommissioners testified that a juror was-not selected for either grand or petit jury service unless the juror was known personally by at least one commissioner. Appellant argues that this selection procedure permits the jury commissioners to know the race, sex; and approximate age of every juror before the venire is' selected, and that as a consequence, a clear and ready opportunity for discrimina-
tion inheres in the selection procedure. Appellant buttresses this conclusion with uncontroverted statistical evidence. that the population of Coweta County is composed of 28.3% eligible blacks, 53.3% eligible women, and 26.2% eligible young adults aged 18-30. Yet, the 2,138 names placed on the petit jury list included only .10.85% blacks, 16.23% women, and 3.097 young adults. Of the 400 persons found to be the "most experienced" and placed on the. grand jury list, only 14.259. were blacks, 4.5% were Women, and 1.25%o'were young adults.
Nevertheless, the Georgia Supreme Court- held that:
"With respect to the contention of de facto. dis-

crimination by the jury commissioners in the selection of individuals to be placed on the jury list, it
is sufficient to say that appellant did not introduce
evidence demanding the conclusion of- de facto dis-
crimination." 230 Ga. 327, 331, 196 S. E. 2d 849, 853 (1973).
Although a defendant in a criminal case does not have
a constitutional right to grand and petit jury arrays that
represent the community in exact, mathematical proportions, the selection procedure employed must provide "a fair possibility for obtaining a representative cross-section of the community." Williams v. Florida, 399 U. S.78, 100 (1970). "[A] State cannot, consistent with -due process, subject a defendant to indictment or trial by a jury.that has been selected in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner, in violation of the Constitution and laws of the United States." Peters v. Kiff, 407 U; S. 493, 50 (1972) (opinion of MAaiSHALL, J.).
Appellant's challenge to the racial composition of the venire appears to me to require application of the principles that guided our judgment in Alexander v. Louisiana, 405 -U. S. 625 (1972). In Alexander petitioner introduced statistical evidence that blacks composed - 21.06% of the population, but only 6.75% of the grand jury panels, demonstrating an underrepresentation of 67.9%. In addition, petitioner introduced evidence that the jury commissioners used. information cards which designated the race of each potential juror. We held that petitioner's statistical evidence establishing that blacks 'were underrepresented, together with the evidence that the selection procedures themselves were not racially neutral, established a prima facie case of invidious racial discrimination, and thus shifted the burden of proof to the State "to rebut the presumption of Unconstitutional action by showing that permissible racially neutral se-

lection criteria and procedures have produced the molochromatic result. Turner v. Fouche, 396 U. S. 346, 361 (1970); Eubanksv. Louisiana,356 U. S. 584, 587.(1958)."
Id., at 632. Since the State failed to meet its burden of proof, we set aside Alexander's con';iction. , Similarly, appellant's statistics here demonstrate substantial underrepresentation of blacks on th6 grand and petit jury venires, 49.5% and 61.7% respectively. Furthermore, there inheres in the selection' procedures e&mployed by the Coweta County jury commissioners the same fatal defect we found in the procedures employed, in Alexander, i. e., the procedures assure .that the jury commissioner shall learn the race of every potential juror before the .list is compiled. See Avery v. Georgia, 345 U. S. 559 (1953); Whitus v. Georgia, 385 U. S. 545 (1967). Thus, appellant in this case -also seems to have established a prima facie case of racial discrimination, which under Alexander shifted to the State the burden of proof to rebut the presumption of unconstitutional action. Under Alexander also, the State's evidence in the form. of the testimony of -the jury commissioners that they -made no conscious effort, to exclude anyone on the basis of race, sex, or age would n6t appear to suffice to rebut the presumption. For in Alexander we held that "affirmations of good faith in making individual selections are insufficient to dispel a prima facie case of systematic exclusion. Turner v. Fouche, supra, at 361; Jones v. Georgia, 389 U. S. 24, 25 (1'967); Sims v. Georgia, 389 U. S. 404, 407 (1967)." 405 U. S., at 632.
Appellant also -contends that women and young adults age 18-30 were systematically and purposefully excluded from the venire from which the grand and petit jury lists were compiled. The statistical evidence indicates that women were underrepresented by 91.6% on the grand jury list, and 70.6% on the petit jury list. Young'

adults were underrepresented by 95.2%. on the grand jury list, and 88.2% on. the petit jury list. Though Alexander involved racial discrimination, appellant's contention certainly presents a substantial question whether the principles of that decision should apply ,where any large, identifiable segment of the community is arbitrarily or discriminatorily underrepresented on the jury venire. Therefore, I would set this case for oral argument to consider both appellant's racial claims and his claims that a selection procedure which enables jury commissioners to know the sex and appwximate age of potential jurors also constitutes a prima facie case of sex or age discrimination.
No. 72-6629. THOMPSON FT AL. v. Mississippi. Appeal from Sup. Ct. Miss. dismissed for want of substantial federal question. Reported below: 269 So. 2d 641.
MR J USTICE DouGiLs, dissenting.
Appellants were part of a group of 25 to 60 blacks congregating about the center of a small Mississippi town. A local police officer approached the crowd and asked them to disperse. The crowd was not interfering with traffic; the officer had received no complaints; and the only person he knew to be bothered by the crowd was himself. -The officer attempted to arrest appellant A. B. Thompson for disturbing the peace after A. B. cursed and acted "real tough." The officer testified that the crowd "started around" him and he pulled his gun.*
*There was further testimony that he pointed the.gun at A. B.'s chest and said: "You don't believe I will shoot you." R. 149, 162. There is a great deal of conflicting testimony, but the record strongly suggests. that the officer's provocative conduct engendered the crowd mumbling and "rambling" which the court below held a "riot." This merely underscores the desirability of our hearing appellants' claim.
"Because a claim of constitutionally protected right is involved, it 'remains our duty in a case such as this to make an independent

He left the crowd and returned with two more officers, again attempting to arrest A. B. after the youth "hurled a vile obscenity" at him. A. B. resisted and in the resulting scuffle was shot. Along with his brother Leon who entered the scuffle when A. B. was shot and Davis Stewart who was "riling up the crowd," A. B. was convicted of riot under a statute th6 constitutionality of which is here
challenged. Mississippi Code Ann. of 1942, § 2361.5-01, subd. A, provides:
"A 'riot' is any use of force or violence disturbing the public peace, or any threat to use such force and violence, if accompanied by immediate power of execution, by two (2) or more persons acting together and without authority of law."
Appellants complain of the vagueness and overbreadth in the phrase "disturbing the public peace."
According to the court below, the "riot" was underway when the officer returned and attempted to arrest A' B., the officer's actions being referred to as an attempt to "quell a riot that had been instigated and-encouraged by this appellant's cursing and using obscene language to excite the crowd.'"- 269 So. 2d 641, 644. Since appellants challenge the facial constitutionality of a statute which, according tb the Mississippi Supreme Court, defines the congregation of blacks in this case as a "riot," the fact that A. B. and Leon Thompson forcefully resisted the police intervention does not end the case. The fact that *their action might fall within the statute if it were constitutionally narrowed, does not negate their ability to challenge the statute, Gooding v. Wilson,. 405 U. S. 518, 521.

Any statute which classifies the congregation of blacks in this case as a riot raises serious constitutional questions. The state court places no limiting construction upon the statute. It first notes that the statute is similar to the federal riot control statute, then discusses whether other Mississippi statutes are constitutiorial, and finally conicludes' that the -challenged statute "sufficiently informed the defendants of the essential elements of the offense." 269 So. 2d, at 644. The challenged statute is not like its federal counterpart. . Title 18 U. S. C. § 2102, unlike the Mississippi statute, necessitates a clear and present danger of property damage or personal injury. The conclusory statement that these defendants were sufficiently informed of the essential elements, is no+ an answer to the matter of overbreadth.
I would note probable jurisdiction.

MR. JUSTICE DouGLAs, with whom TE CHIEF JuST'ICE concurs, dissenting.
Petitioner,' a 50-year-old inmate in the Kentucky prison system, brought a pro se action -for damages under 42 U. S. C. § 1983, alleging that prison officials had violated his civil rights. Petitioner alleged that on two separate occasions, Kentucky prison officials notified him of a transfer from one institution to another at 2:30 or 3 p. in., and that he was moved later on the same day. -On the occasion of the first of these transfers on short notice (apparently on October 8, ,1970, from the Kentucky State Reformatory in LaGrange to the Kentucky State Penitentiary in Eddyville), officers allegedly refused to give petitioner time to recover two books on auto mechanics whieh he had been compiling for two years. .On the occasion of the second of these transfers (apparently on. August 14, 1972, back to the reformatory), prson officials did not allow petitioner to recover a book in which he had alphabetized legal cases, laboring on weekends for a year.2
'Since there is no jurisdiction for an appeal, this action should
be treated as a petition for certiorari. 28 U. S. C. § 2103. 2 Apparently also on -fie occasion of the second-transfer, peti-
tioner was'required by prison regulations to mail his personal belongings t somebody on the outside, who could then mail the items back to him after his transfer to the new institution.' Coupled with a prison regulation which permits inmates to receive books 6nly from publishing houses, this served to work a particular hardship on petitioner. He was forced to mail a book, which he had pur-

DouGLAS, J., dissenting

414 U. S.

Petitioner contends that the First-Amendment gives him the right "to read and write. To think and to put it on paper." He argues, also, that the action of the prison officials violated the Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth Amendments, which are applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.
The District Court dismissed petitioner's action and deemed any appeal "frivolous" on the ground that alleged loss of property could not establish jurisdiction under the Civil Rights Act. We put such reasoning to rest in Lynch v. Household Finance Corp., 405 U. S. 538. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed, on the ground that "the petitioner-appellant voluntarily relinquished possession of the personal property in question."
The assertion that petitioner voluntarily abandoned books on which he had labored for two years not-only defies belief, but it is also unsupported by the. record. The respondent prison officials do not contest petitioner's factual allegations, but rather state lamely that it is, "clear from the facts" that petitioner voluntarily gave up his property. And even if he did not, respondents argue that:
"The question presented is whether the administrative policies at the Kentucky State Penitentiary at Eddyville, Kentucky, and the administrative policies at the Kentucky State Reformatory at LaGrange in transferring him on short notice-requiring him to abandon, give away, or mail home various personal items . . . are violative of his constitutional rights, or of the rights of inmates generally.
"Allegations made by, the appellant in this appeal as heretofore set out utterly fail to state a violation

of-his civil rights..... [T]he transferring of appellant from one prison to the other, as well as the fact
that' in any such move certain procedures must be followed with regard to the transfer of properties, are proper regulatory functions prescribed and administered by the prison officials and not violative of any civil rights."
I cannot agree. This case may to some seem picayune. But basically it presents the substantial question of whether senseless, medieval practices of state officials can be "immunized" 'from the reach of the Civil Rights Act simply because they occur within the walls of prisons. See Sostre v. McGinnis, 442 F. 2d 178 (CA2 1971). I would grant' certiorari.

In Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U. S. 778, this Court was presented with the question whether an indigent probationer or parolee has a due process right to ap,pointed counsel at revocation hearings. Noting that

OCTOBER TERM, 1973

414 U. S.

"due process is not so rigid as to require that the significant interests in informality, flexibility, and economy must always be sacrificed" by judicializing the- revocation process with the presence of attorneys, a case-bycase analysis was held necessary for that determination. Id., at 788. The Court today remands for such an analysis. But the only issue in this case is whether the court below was correct in holding that the Equal Protection Clause requires the right to appointed counsel at parole revocation hearings in cases where, unlike Gagnon v. Scarpelli, &upra,a solvent parolee has a statutory right to the presence of retained counsel. Gagnon is inapposite. The State of Florida has already determined by statute that any interest ir. flexibility and informality derived from the absence of attorneys will always be sacrificed when a parolee of means desires the assistance of counsel. Whether in such cases the Equal Protection Clause demands that indigent parolees be afforded the same representation rights, was not answered in Gagnon. I would take this case in order to decide it here.

MR. JusTICE DouGLAs, dissenting.
Mr. Justice Holmes in Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438i 470 (dissenting), called wiretapping "dirty business.". That decision was rendered in 1928. Since that time "dirty business" has become the apt phrase describing the regime under which we now live. The warrant requirement which this, Court imposed as a condition to that kind of surveillance, Berger v. New York, 388 U.-S. 41, and the Act'of Congress which implemented that decision, 18 U. S. C. §§ 2510-2520; United States v. U. S. -District Court, 407 U. S; 297, have been flouted. We who live in the District of Columbia know that electronic surveillance is commonplace. I am indeed morally certain that the Conference Room of this Court has been "bugged"; and President Johnson during his term in the White House asserted to me that even his phone was tapped.
We deal with a disease that has permeated our society. Certainly Ms. Heutsche is an "aggrieved" person within the meaning of 18 U. S. C. § 3504 (a) (1). 1 That section

1-§ 3504. (a) In any trial, hearing, or other proceeding in or before any court, grand jury, department, officer, agency, regulatory body, or other authority of the United States" "(1) upon a claim by a party aggrieved that evidence is inad-
missible because it is the primary product of an unlawful act or .because it was obtained by the exploitation of an unlawful act, the opponent of 'the claim shall affirm or deny the occurrence of. the alleged unlawful act.. "

does not restrict its protection to conversations of an
accused. It should be liberally construed as it deals with
the right of privacy protected by the Fourth Amendment. The conversation of one's lawyer over the telephone may
be as helpful to Big Brother as the conversation of the accused herself. The lawyer preparing the defense may in his telephone conversations reveal concessions made by the accused or his trial strategy or clu6s to the defense
which will be proffered that may be extremely helpful to the prosecution. If electronic surveillance were strictly employed by the Executive Branch, we might .be chary of enlarging its duties as requested here. But since we live in a regime where the "dirty business" of wiretapping runs rampant, I would apply the statute liberally to check the disease which almost every'newspaper tells us has poisoned our body politic.
We are told that-in -this case the applicant's lawyers did discuss her case with persons other than herself over the telephone. Is Big Brother to have a ringside seat where he can listen to all the confidences of lawyers who defend an accused? If so, what happens to the valued right of counsel protected by the Sixth Amendment?
On June 26, 1972, Margaret Heutsche, the applicant herein, was arrested by the FBI on charges relating to the removal and destruction of Government property from a Selective Service.System office. Although a preliminary hearing resulted in 's finding of probable cause, she remained free on her own recognizance and heard nothing further on the case until called to testify before a federal grand jury nearly a year later: When she invoked her constitutional right to refrain from testifying, the Government obtained a grant of use immunity pursuant to 18 U. S. C. § 6002 and an order from the District Court compelling the applicant to testify. The

applicant again refused to testify and sought reconsideration of the District Court order, claiming that the subpoena and the questions propounded by the grand jury were the product of illegal electronic surveillance of her and that the Government had not properly affirmed or denied that claim as required by 18 Ur S. 10. § 3504.2 She claims that the same barrier extends to her lawyer. The applicant also moved for a disclosure of any electronic surveillance of her attorneys and their consultants, and for an evidentiary hearing on the sufficiency of the disclosure.
In response to the motions, the Government filed the affidavit of a high Justice Department official 'to the effect that, based on an inquiry addressed to seven federal agencies:
"[T]here has been no electronic surveillance occurring on premises known to have been owned, leased or licensed by Margaret Ann[e] Heiutsche.
"The deponent further states that there was no electronic surveillance' directed against Margaret Ann[e] Heutsche, per se, and there have been no known overhearings by electronic surveillance, at any. location, of conversations to which Margaret Ann[e] Heutsche was a party."
The applicant maintained that the surveillance denial was inadequate for, inter alia, failing to deny electronic surveillance of her attorneys and, their associates and consultants which may have yielded conversations concerning her case.' The applicant -submitted affidavits

2 See n. 1, supra. 3The widespread use of electronic surveillance is demonstrated by the list of agencies consulted before making the denial: FBI; Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs; Secret Service; IRS; Customs;
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; and the Postal Service.

from -several attorneys and consultants who swore
that they discussed her case among themselves over phone lines on which all had ,been experiencing strange and suspicious problems.4 On the basis of these affidavits the applicant requested an evidentiary hearing as to illegal electronic surveillance. The District Court denied relief and, upon the applicant's further refusal to testify, the Government moved that she be adjudged in contempt and ordered committed. 'Applicant submitted further affidavits and moved to cross-examine the Justice Department official who denied the existence of
electronic .surveillance.
The District Court. again denied her motions and held applicant in contempt, .orderihg her- subiiitted to the custody of the United States Marshal. The Court of Appeals affirmed, finding that the. applicant had made no showing which would require the Government to make an investigation of electronic surveillance of her attorneys The case is before this Court on the application of Ms. Heutsche to be released from custody pending review here of the decision of the Court of Appeals. The applicable standard for the relief sought is found in 28 U. S. C. § 1826 (b), which directs denial only if the issues are frivolous or the appeal is taken for purposes of delay.
I cannot agree, that the applicant's showing is not sufficient at least to entitle her to an evidentiary hearing. In a country where the Government overhears

over 500,000 conversatioifs a year pursuant to court authorized wiretaps alone,5 it is difficult to gainsay anyone's fear of the intrusion of Big Brother's ear. The daily news brings fresh evidence to make a reality of Mr. Chief Justice Warren's warning that the "fantastic advances in the field of electronic communication constitute a great danger to the privacy of the individual .... , In,such circumstances the Govern-

5Administrative Office of the United States Courts, Report on Applications for Orders Authorizing or Approving the Interception
of Wire or Oral Communications, Table 4 (1972).
In 1954 I stated that: "During 1952, there were in New York City alone at least 58,000 orders issued which allowed wiretapping-over 150 a day every day in the year. The New York system has in practice been oppressive; it has been used as the-means whereby police have obtained guarded confidences of 'people and used the information for corrupt purposes."
W. Douglas,. An Almanac of Liberty 355 (1954). After reading this statement District Attorney Edward Silver of
New York attempted to obtain wiretap data from District Attorneys and police. He reported to the House Judiciary Committee that thc total was only 480. Hearings on H. R. 762 before Subcommittee No. 5 ofth'e House Committee on the Judiciary, 84th Cong., 1st Sess., 99 (1955). The Committee called Sidney Davis, former Law Clerk for Mr. Justice Black and the New York attorney who had helped me on the study. He testified as to a misunderstanding between us: there were not 58,000 orders but 58,000 taps, including illegal taps. Id., at -203. District -Attorney Frank Hogan of New York testified that claims of illegal wiretapping of such magnitude were "the cries of alarmists .. . who are inclined to . . inflate incidents and conditions in order to sustain their arguments." Id., at 322. But the "cries of alarm" proved realistic. In 1959, Samuel Dash, on the basis
of extrapolations from man-hour statistics on policemen admittedly engaged in wiretapping activity, concludes that my estimates of that activity were "closer to the truth than the figures submitted by the police to [Edward Sil er]." S. Dash, The Eavesdroppers 68-69 (19659).

ment's claim that it should not be put to the task of
searching its files for evidence of specific surveillance cannot be treated lightly. I take cognizance of the fact that the mass of aggregate data on the citizenry yielded in this Orwellian era may indeed make the task a diffi-
cult one. But the difficulty which should concern us is that
faced by the victim of illegal surveillance. How is the applicant in this case to establish the existence of such clandestine activity so expertly carried on by the Executive Branch? She has introduced sworn statements that her attorneys-themselves likely subjects of Government surveillance 7-- discussed her case over phone lines fraught with indicia of intrusion. She has introduced further sworn statements that electronic tests reveal a likelihood of such intrusion. Yet the court below held this insufficient even to require the Government to check its records on specific phone lines identi-
fied by the applicant. The victims of illegal governmental surveillance are
thus apparently faced with the insurmountable task of proving such surveillance before the Government will be asked to respond to allegations of its existence or participate in an evidentiary hearing to decide the matter. In seeking review of that holding the applicant raises serious issues of constitutional magnitude. She has alleged Government misconduct interfering not only With her right to privacy but with her right to the effec-

7Her attorneys include members of the San Francisco chapter of the National Lawyers Guild and an organization in Chicago known as the "Peoples Law Office.", Peoples is a firm almost exclusively devoted to the criminal defense of "militants" and "radicals," including Chairman Fred Hampton of the Black Panther Party and Bernadine Dohrn and Marc Rudd of the Weatherman faction of the SDS.

tive assistance of counsel by. destroying her attorneys' ability to discuss her case in confidence. Having shown all anyone will ever be able to show in this area prior to a Government response, she further questions how those constitutional rights have any meaning,, when more is required before the victim of illegal surveillance is even entitled to a hearing. These are serious questions of broad impact in an area not yet expounded upon by this Court. In denying the requested interim relief, can the Court possibly hold that the attempt to raise those questions is frivolous? I would grant-bail; expedite the grant of certiorari, and put the case down for early argument and decision.

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting.
In March 1971, the FCC issued a public notice, Licensee Responsibility to Review Records Before Their Broadcast, 28 F. C. C. 2d 409, which was interpreted in many quarters as-a prohibition on the playing of "drug related" songs by licensees.1 ' That belief was strengthened five weeks later when the Commission's Bureau of Complaints and Compliance provided broadcasters with the names of 22 songs labeled "drug oriented" on the basis of their lyrics. The industry widely viewed this as a list of banned songs, and many licensees quickly acted to remove other songs from the air as

stopped playing, regardless of subject or lyric, all the works of particular artists whose views might offend the Commission. 155 U. S. App. D. C. 390, 399 n. 9, 478 F. 2d 594, 603 n. 9 (1973) (Bazelon, C. J., disseflting) (citing petitioners' joint appendix, pp.
872-88). In its subsequent order in Aprii the Commission reported that the list of 22 songs had been identified by the Department of the Arrmy. 31 F. C. C. 2d 379 (1971).

well. Some announcers were fired for playing suspect
songs. In April the Commission denied a petition for recon-
sideration, but attempted to "clarify" its previous order. 31 F. C. C. 2d 377. But although it repudiated the list of banfied songs, it reiterated the basic threat by noting that "the broadcaster could jeopardize his license by failing to exercise licensee responsibility in this area." The nature of that responsibility was unclear. The new statement indicated reaffirmation of the prior decision, yet two concurring commissioners indicated that it restored the status quo to the March notice. It seems clear, however, that the Commission majority intended to coerce broadcasters into refusing to play-songs that in the Commission's judgment were somehow "drug related." The April order suggested the prescreening of. songs as one method of compliance. And in subsequent testimony before Congress, the Chairman of the Commission stated that if a licensee was playing songs that in the Commission's judgment "promote the use of hard drugs," "I know what I would do, I would probably vote to take the license away." 3
Still unsure of its responsibilities, but desiring to avoid distorting its artistic- judgments by superimposing the Commission's vague sociological ones, petitioner Yale Broadcasting Company. drafted its own station policy
and submitted it to the Commission, asking for a declaratory ruling on whether it complied with the Com-
mission's orders., The station proposed to fulfill its

orated its policy in a six-page statement. The Commission, finding the proposed policy too "abstract," declined to issue any declaratory ruling. The petitioners then brought this action, challenging the Commission's actions on First Amendment grounds, and arguing that the regulations were -impermissibly vague. Petitioners also argued that they should have been the subject of formal rule-making procedures.
In Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Democratic NationalCommittee, 412 U. S. 94, 148 (1973) (concurring in judgment), I indicated my view that TV and radio stand in the same protected position under the First *Amendment as do newspapers and magazines. I had not participated in the earlier opinion in Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S. 367 (1969), which
placed broadcasters under a different regime, authorizing governmental regulation to ensure "fairness" of presentation. I explained in Columbia Broadcasting, supra, the inevitable danger resulting from placing such powers in governmental hands-a danger appreciated by the Framers of the First Amendment. "The Fairness Doctrine has no place in our First Amendment regime. It puts the head of-the camel inside the tent and enables administration after administration to toy with TV or radio in order to serve its sordid or its benevolent ends." 412 U, S., at 154. The instant case well illustrates those dangers.'
I doubt that anyone would seriously entertain the notion that consistent with the First. Amendment the

Government could force a newspaper out of business if its news stories betrayed tob'much sympathy with those arrested on marihuana charges, or because it published articles by drug advocates such as Timothy Leary. The proposition is so clear. that rarely has, the Government ever tried such a thing. See Near v. Minnesota, 283 U. S' 697 (1931). If the Government set up a new bureau With the job of reviewing newspaper stories for such "dangerous" tendencies, and with the power to put out of business those publications which. failed toconform to the bureau's standards, the publisher would not have to wait until his newspaper had been destroyed to challenge the bureau's authority. The threat of .governmental action alone would impose a prohibited restraint upon the press. "[I] nhibition as well as prohibition' against the, exercise- of 'precious First- Amendment rights is a power denied to government." Lamont v. PostmasterGeneral,381 U.

Yet this is precisely the course taken here by the FCC.-'The Commission imposes on the licensees a responsibility to analyze the meaning of each song's lyrics and make a judgment as :to the social value of the hnessage. The message may be clear or obscure, and careful scrutiny would seem required. This task is to be carried out under the Commission's watchful -eye and with the knowledge that repeated errors will be punished by revocation of the license.

"Under such a rule, would-be critics of official conduct, may -be deterred from voicing their criticism, even though it is believed to be true and even though it is in fact true, because of doubt whether it can be proved in court or fear of the expense of having to do so.. They tend to make only statements which 'steer far wider of the unlawful zone.' . . . The rule thus dampens the vigor and limits the variety of public debate. It is inconsistent with the First and Fourteenth Amendments.' Ibid. Songs play no less a role in public debate, whether they eulogize the John Brown of the abolitionist movement, or the Joe Hill of the union movement, provide a rallying cry such as "We Shall Overcome," or express in music the values of the youthful "counterculture." The Government cannot, consistent with the First Amendment, require a broadcaster to censor its music any more than it can require a newspaper to censor the stories of its reporters. Under our system the Government is not to decide what messages, spoken- or in music, are of, the proper "social value" to reach the people.

In 1969 the petitioner was indicted for obstructing an investigation of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and he was convicted by a jury. Both in pretrial motions and on appeal the defendant insisted that the Government had obtained an .identical indictment in 1966 but had for some reason kept it secret, and that thereforethere was a three-year post-indictment delay which denied the defendant his right to a speedy trial. The Government would not confirm or deny this allegation, and the defendant was unable to produce substantiating evidence. The conviction was affirmed, the Court of Appeals concluding. that in any case no prejudice was shown by the defendant. 439 F. 2d 751, 755-756 (PA2 1971). The present probeeding arises from petitioner's motion to vacate sentence, based on newly discovered evidence confirming the petitioner's earlier suspicions and revealing motivations for the delay which the District Court found were "unworthy, and discreditable." The motion was denied, however, again for the reason that no prejudice had been shown, and the Court of Appeals again affirmed.

ment embarked on a conscious mission to conceal the 1966 indictment to prevent disclosure of an illegal
wiretap on a member of the Bar. At first the indictment was sealed. Two years later the Chief of the Fraud
Section of the Criminal Division wrote a confidential memorandum to the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Division. He pointed out that the indictment was sealed because of its factual relationship to another indictment returned the same day against a Miami attorney, who had been the subject of the "electronic surveillance." The memorandum continued: "Immediately after the return of the indictments, United States Attorney Mbrgenthau expressed great concern over the disclosure of these logs, because he did not want to spread on the record that the Department had engaged in electronic surveillance of a member of the bar. Assistant United States Attorney Givens now proposes the dismissal of the indictment as to [the attorney] and the opening of the Alo indictment . . . ." The memorandum then went on to state why it might be possible to prevent disclosure of the wiretap in a prosecution of Alo, the petitioner here, an associate of the overheard attorney.
For reasons still unknown, the Government never did proceed with the 1966 indictment against the petitioner; instead it kept that indictment secret and proceeded with
the new indictment, more than three years after the original 1966 indictment. Although the suspicions of the defense were aroused, as indicated above the Government was able to keep the earlier indictment and the embarrassing, wiretaps secret throughout petitioner's
trial. In Barker v. Windo, 407 U. S. 514, 533 (1972), we
noted that a speedy trial is "a fundamental right of the accused" that is "specifically affirmed in the Constitution." In determining whether that right had been denied, Vve looked primarily to four factors: "Length

of. delay, the reason for the' delay, the defendant's assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant." Id., at 530. But we. cautioned that -no one of these four factors is 'a necessary or sufficient condition" to finding that the right to Speedy trial has been denied: Id., at 533.
There can be no contention that the three-year delay is "de minimis," and the defendant here surely cannot be faulted for failing to assert his right. See id., at 525-527. The Government argues that he has made no showing of prejudice however, and on this basis alone his claim should be denied.- The petitioner-argues that in a case such as this, where the delay, caused by the Government, is not only unjustified but is "unworthy ' and discreditable," his- failure tp make a showing of prejudice is not crucial.
In 1963 Mr. Chief Justice Warren warned that the "fantastic advances in the field .of electronic comnunication con'stitute a great danger, to the privacy of the indi.vidual . . [imposing] a heavier responsibility on this Court in its supervision of the fairness of procedures in the. federal court system.,' Lopez v. United States, 373
U. S. 427, 441 (concurring). That danger has not abated. In 1972 alone 43,000 people were 'overheard in 500,000
conversations pursuant to electronic surveillance authorized under Title III of*the Omnibus -Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U. S. C. § 2510 et seq. Administrative Office of the United States Courts, Report on Applications for :Orders Authorizing or Approving the Interception of Wire or Oral Communications, Table 4, pp. 1.2-13. (1972). There is no tally available of the electronic surveillance 'undertaken which does not purport to be authorized by Title III. My views on the constitutionality of electronic surveillance have been expressed before. See, e. g. United States v. White, 401 U. S. 745, 756 (1971).

Nothing in our opinion in Barker suggests that a finding of prejudice is necessary before relief can be granted in denial of a speedy trial; indeed, as pointed out above, the opposite is true. Cf. Strunk v. United States, 412 U. S. 434 (1973). The admitted Government misconduct here which led to the three-year delay arguably presents the kind of fact situation in which it is not necessary for the defendant to show prejudice.

This case involves a libel suit based on statements made in the heat of the vigorous 1966 campaign for the ofce of Governor of California. Respondents published -a -poll indicating that, of the candidates in the Republican primary, petitioner was favored by only 1%" of the voters. Petitioner responded by saying that he beheved, based on reports from a reliable source, that the poll was corrupt, dishonest, and rigged as a result of a bribe paid by one of the other candidates. Respondents ingtituted a libel action and recovered $300,000 in damages.
Respondents concede public figure status and the libel a vardlis thus based on the "malice" with which petitioner madel the statements. See, Rosenbloom v. Metromedia, 403 iT.

In my opinion the First Amendment prohibits the use of civil libel laws toimpose damages for the discussion of public affairs or criticism of public figures, and this prohibition is in no way dependent upon the results of uncertain speculation as to the "malicious" mental state of the spe~ke. Freedom of speech does not admit of differentiation limiting its applicability to those possessed of judicially approved states of mind.

Petitioner seeks certiorari from the California Court of Appeal, which reversed a $55,000 jury verdict in his favor in this Federal Employers' Liability Act case.Petitioner suffered serious injuries 'when struck by a speeding-.car while crossing a highway separating respondent's yards, which have no food-seiving facilities from a diner on the other side of the highway. The court found that petitioner was acting within the scope of ..his employment; he was on a paid 20-minute lunch break and was on call. The court also found that there was sufficient evidence of foreseeability and avoidability to take the case t6 the jury. There were no stop signs on the highway, which had a 40-mile-per-hour speed limit. There was evidence that respondent knew 'that its employees frequently crossed the highway to the diner and had in fact constructed a path for them-to the edge of the highway; that workers at times had to wait up to five minutes to cross the highway; that respondent knew of a previous accident involving one of its employees crossing the highway; but' that respondent had taken no steps t5 mitigate the dangers to its employees.
Nonetheless, the court entered judgment n. o. v. for respondent, reasoning that in FELA cases the common law of negligence requires that a "duty" of the employer to the employee has to be shown, and that such

OCTOBER TERM, 1973

duty was not present in this case. The court, "synthesizing" past cases, found that a "duty" had been found only when (1) an employee was injured on the premises of his employer, or (2) an employee was required to be on the premises of a third party in the performance of duties for the employer.
The California court has limited the applicability of the FELA contrary to the purpose of Congress when it amended the Act to wipe out a host of judicially created defenses which had been engrafted on the Act. See Rogers v. MissouriPacificR. Co., 352 U. S. 500, 508-510; Tiller v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co.,'318 U. S. 54, 64-68. Moreover, lower federal courts have found FELA liability where an employee was injured on the premises of a third party though not required to be there by the employer to conduct the employer's business. See Carter v. Union R. Co., 438 F. 2d 208, 210-211; cf. Kooker v. Pittsburgh& Lake Erie R. Co., 258 F. 2d 876, 878. See also Smalls v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 348 U.

Rodman then appealed and the Court of Appeals reversed, 474 F. 2d 32 (CA7 1973), finding no basis on which to hold Rodman liablo for the concededly illegal
and fraudulent scheme. Both Sennott and Jordan were members of the Chicago
Board of Trade, although Sennott had little experience
in securities investments. They became acquainted and Jordan urged Sennott to open an account at Rodman through him, saying that -his father had made money for other Board of Trade members. Ultimately Sennott agreed and between 1964 and 1966 his trading volume in the accounts at Rodman w~s more than .$2 million, 70% of which was through'accounts opened by Jordan
Unknown to Sennott during this period, Jordan's employment by Rodman had been terminated because of his questionable integrity, and he had no official connectio-i with the firm after 1958. The Securities and Exchange Commission had held in a 1962 order that between 1955 and 1957 Jordan, while employed by another broker-dealer, had violated various antifraud provisions of the Securities Act. In 1958 his registration as a representative of a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers had been revoked because of deceptive practices.
In early 1964 Jordan induced Sennott to invest in a secondary offering by Skyline Homes, Inc., that Rodman was handling. Soon after, Jordan encouraged him to buy additional shares of Skyline through stock options made available to William, his father, for the father's services in underwriting the secondary offering. Sennott ulti mately invested $142,000 in these options. They did not

exist and Jordan placed the money in his wife's checking account to use in paying off trading losses. Suspicion did not arise immediately because the options were not duo for delivery for seven months. After that, Jordan was able to hold off Sennott's suspicions with various
stories. In October 1964, Sennott was told that Rodman's
managing partner, Carroll, wanted to talk to him. William Rothbart told Sennott that the options were none of Carroll's business and that Sennott should not cooperate.- William and Jordan accompanied Sennott to his meeting with Carroll, where Carroll revealed that Sennott's checks had been deposited in Jordan's wife's account. But Sennott abided by his agreement with William not to cooperate with Carroll, -and Jordan was again able to explain away this suspicious circumstance.' William assured Sennott he would receive the options. The truth finallk dawned on Sennott in 1966 when he
found that another member of the Board of Trade had been the victim of a similar scheme of Jordan's; Sennott also discovered Jordan's past at this time. Jordan was expelled "from the Board of Trade.
On the basis of these facts the trial judge found Rodman, as well as Jordan and William, liable. Rodman's
liability was based, inter alia, on § 20 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U. S. C. § 78t), which is set out below? The Court of Appeals reversed, finding

Here Rodman accepted the orders placed through Jordan for over two years, collecting profits on over $2 million worth of securities transactions. It allowed
Jordan to place those orders through its phone on the floor of the Board of Trade, which was under the control
of a Rodman employee and was used by only two people besides Jordan-a Rodman partner and a Rodman broker. The District Court found that during this period Jordan solicited orders for R~odman in the same way from at least five others on the floor of the- Board of Trade. As the Court of Appeals concedes, Rodman cannot claim lack of knowledge of these activities of Jordan's. Yet in allowing Jordan to hold himself out as an agent of Rodman, with special access because of his association with one of its partners, and accepting the considerable benefits of Jordan's activities, Rodnan must be responsible for Jordan's acts even under general agency principles--Lwhich do not require even that the principal benefit from the apparent agent's fraud.

usurpation of authority in order to gain the benefits, Rodman cannot- suddenly disclaim -liability. In the option-fraud Jordan purported to act through William, a Rodman partner, just as he purported to act with Rodman's consent in the earlier sales, for which Rodman accepted the profits without complaint. In buying the
options Sennott was obviously relying on Rodman's purported association with Skyline.
'Nor can Rodman interpose the defense of good faith where it knew. of Jordan's history of questionable pr,ctices but did-nothing to warn Sennott. "[T]o satisfy the requirement of good faith [in order for a controlling person to avoid liability thereby] it is necessary for the [controlling person] to show that some precautionary measures were taken to prevent the injury suffered."

The District Court here found Rodman to be a controlling person under § 20 (a) and therefore liable to Sennott. I cannot see how that determination can be held clearly erroneous.

It is well established that "'if the only objective of a state practice is to discourage the assertion of constitutional rights it is "patently unconstitutional."'" Chaffin v. Stynchcombe, 412 U. S. 17, 33 n. 20; Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U. S.618, 631; -TfnitedStates v. Jackson,

the death penalty clause in the Federal Kidnaping Statute, 18 U. S. C. § 1201 (a), which essentially, insulated from the death penalty those defendants who waived the right to .jury tri.alor pleaded guilty, imposed an impermissible burden on the exercise of Sixth Amendment
rights. Such express statutory schemes, however, are not the
only mechanism for positing with an accused the necessity of determining whether the risk of greater punishment attending the exercise of constitutional rights makes that exercise too costly. A guilty plea constitutes 'a waiver of several fundamental rights, among them the right to jury trial. See Santobello v. New York, 404 U. S.257, 264 (DouGL.S, J., concurring). Plea bargaining, the extreme importance' of which was recognized in Santobello, leaves with the lprosecutor the power to set the price for the exercise of those rights. Machibroda v. United States, 368 U. S. 487, held a guilty plea voidable if'induced by the proseuutbr's threat to bring additional prosecutions. Yet plea bargaining would be eliminated if an accepted plea to a lesser offense was rendered constitutionally vulnerable by the prosecutor's expressed intent to otherwise proceed, to triail on the crime charged.

Despite the magnitude of the constitutional issues and the important role of plea bargaining in the administration of criminal justice (see White, A Proposal for Reform of the Plea Bargaining Process, 119 U. Pa. -L. Rev. 439 (1971), and Note, The Unconstitutionality of Plea Bargaining, 83 Harv. L. Rev. 1387 (1970)), this Court has never spelled out the constitutional limits of the ptactice. This case, in which the accused's right to jury trial was expressly burdened with the possibility of a mandatory life sentence (possibly the maximum penalty a State may exact for criminal conduct; see Furman v. Georgia,408 U. S. 238) under the habitual offender provisions, provides an opportunity to delimit its permissible bounds. I would take that .opportunity.

In Bell v. Burson, 402 U.

Petitioner's license was suspended under an essentially identical statute, and petitioner was arrested for driving without a license, prior to our decision in Bell. During his trial, he raised Bell as a defense to the criminal charge, but the Connecticut courts rejected the defense because the events complained of, the suspension and subsequent arrest, occurred prior to Bell. Refusal to apply Bell to petitioner's case on this ground is in error in view of the fa t that this Court vacated and. remanded for further proceedings in light of Bell at least three, lower federal. court cases challenging' license suspensions which had occurred prior to our

The State also argues that petitioner cannot raise Bell as a defense to his criminal charge because he has chosen not to challenge his suspension by seeking available judicial review of the suspension itself, so that he has not raised his contentions in the proper state forum.

Petitioners are members of the Pit River Indian Nation who, in order to construct Indian-style buildings, felled one ponderosa pine growing on the public lands of the United States, but within the original boundaries of the lands occupied by their ancestors. They were prosecuted under 18 U. S. C. § 1852, which provides in relevant part:
"Whoever cuts .. . timber growing on the public lands of the United States.

"Shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.
"This section shall not prevent any miner or agriculturist from clearing his land in the ordinary working ,of his mining claim, or in the preparatioin of his farm for tillage, or, from t aking the timber

necessary to support his improvements, or the taking
of timber for the use of the United States; nor shall it interfere with or take away any right or
privilege under any existing law of the'UnitedStates
to cut' or remove timber from ani public lands."
(Itmphasis added.)
In their defense, petitioners claimed that the original "aboriginal title" or "Indian title" to their ancestral
tribal lands constituted a right recognized by existing law. The Court of Appeals dismissed this claim, reasoning that the specific exemptions granted miners, farmers, and the United States negatived a reading of the ".existing law" clause which would include ancestral title, and noting that there was no "relevant authority" for the defense raised by petitioners..
There is, of course, no "relevafit authority for petitioners' claim; because the issue of whether the "existing law" clause of 18 U. S. C. § 1852 reaches aboriginal or. Indian 'title has not been previously litigated.
'But this Court has often held that .jthe occupation of property by Indians' ancestors gives rise to Indian title, which, though not a property interest subjject to Fifth Amendment protections, encompasses the right to occupancy ind use-the right to fish,'to hunt, and, to cut timber sufficient for use on the land. See,e.g., Tee-HitTon Indians v. United States, 348 "U.S.272, 279; United
States v. Santa Fe Pacific R. Co., 314 U. S. 339, 345; UnitedStates v. Cook, 19 Wall. 591, 59?-594; Johnson v. M'Intosh, 8 Wheat.' 543, 574, 584, 591 (Marshall, C. J.). This, I think, is a right recognized by the "existing law" of the United States.
A question strikingly similar to the issue in this case arose in Cramer v. United States, 261 U. S.219, where a landgrant by the United States to a railroad excepted lands "reserved . . . or otherwise disposed, of." Some

of the land encompassed. by the grant was occupied by three individual Iidians. The United States, on behalf of the Indians, argued that the words of the exceptions clause; though obviously general, nonetheless encompassed the right of occupancy of the Indians. The Court, finding the occupancy of the. individual Indians closely
akin tolhe "original nomadic tribal occupancy" relied on by petitioners in this case, agreed with the United States because "[u]nquestionably it has been the policy of the Federal Government from the beginning to respect the Indian right of occupancy" Id., at 227. The Court held that the "fact that such right of occupancy finds no recognition in any statute or other formal governmental action is .not conclusive. The right, under the circumstances here disclosed, flows from a settled governmental" policy." Id., at 229.
As the Court stated in 1912,
"[I]n the Government's dealings with ,the Indians . . . [t]he construction, instead of being, strict, is liberal; doubtful expressions, instead of being resolved in favor of the Uited States, are to be rekolved in favor of a weak and --defenseless people, who are wa'ds of the nation, and dependent wholly upon its protection and good faith.- Th::s rule of construction has been recognized, withort exception, for more than' a hundred years . Choate v. Trapp, 224 U. S. 665, 675.'
I see no reason why, in our time, that rule of construction should be ntullified in the absence of any affirmative showing that Congress chosenot to recognize aboriginal Indiin title as a defense to 18 U. S . §1852. Considering the solicitude of the Federal Government for Indian title in the past, the -Courtof Appeals arguably was in error in rejecting the claims of the petitioners

In Griffin v. California. 380 U. S. 609 (1965), we held that the Fifth Amendment guarantee against selfincrimination prohibits a prosecutor from commenting to the jury upon the defendant's failure to testify at his trial. Such a practice would place a price on the defendant's invocation of his constitutional privilegea price that would seriously undermine the value of that privilege. And in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966), we held that the prosecutor may not introduce into evidence statements of the accused taken while he was in police custody, unless those statements were made in compliance with procedures ensuring that the accused had understood and intelligently waived his Fifth Amendment privilege.
Indeed we said in Miranda:
"In accord with our decision today, it is impermissible to penalize an individual for exercising his Fifth Amendment privilege when he is under police custodial interrogation. The prosecution may not, therefore, use at trial the fact that he stood mute or claimed his privilege in the face of accusation." 'Id., at 468 n. 37.

DOUGLAs, J.; dissenting

This case presents a situation very much like 'those found constitutionally wanting -in Miranda and Griffin. Here the accused apparently understood his Fifth Amend-
ment privilege and said nothing while in police custody, and that silence was brought before the jury by the prosecutor, who argued that they could infer guilt from
it. Seeking to vindicate his federal constitutional rights, the prisoner ultimately brought an action for habeas corpus in federal court, and the, District Court granted
the writ. The Court of Appeals reversed.
Petitioner has been convicted of murder. It was uncontested that he shot the deceased while alone with him, but petitioner maintained that the gun went off
accidentally during a scuffle which began when the deceased pointed the gun at him. The petitioner was arrested later that night when the police 'found him asleep inside a tire store where he was once employed. Unaware of the shooting, the police charged him only with breaking and entering. They asked him no questions about the killing earlier that evening; and hevolunteered no information. It was this silence-this act *of not volunteering incriminating information-that was ultimately used against him.
At trial he testified in his own behalf and told his story of the accidental shooting.. On cross-examiration the prosecutor brought out that the defendant hal not told this story' to the police. The defense asked for a curative instruction to the jury, informing it that the defendant had no duty to tell the police that he had just-shot someone. This was denied. Apparently
encouraged, the prosecutor told the jury in summation:
"He never tild the police he accidentally shot

he go and say, 'I just accidentally shot somebody.'" Burt v. Yeager, 342 F. Supp. 188, 192 (N. J. 1972).
In upholding the conviction the court below found that Harris v. New York, 401 U. S. 222 (1971), not Griffin, supra, was controlling. In Harris the majority held that statements otherwise. barred by Mirandamay be introduced to impeach a defendant with the temerity to testify in his own behalf. It is argued that here, as in Harris, the defendant's prior statements are inconsistent. But of course here there are no prior statements; it is the defendant's silence that is used against him. The District Court, after carefully reviewing the record, found that the silence was just as consistent with the defendant's story as with the prosecution's case. In reversing, the Court of Appeals concluded otherwise. We thus seem to have come to the point where the exercise of one's constitutional rights can be offered to the jury as evidence of guilt.
We should grant this petition for certiorari.

Although both the misdemeanor and felony charges arose out of the "same transaction or occurrence," they were prosecuted by the State in separate proceedings.

Maryland,395 U.

Subsequently she was convicted of importing the substance. Conceding that the police were justified in causing her to submit to a body cavity search under the present "clear indication" standard,' petitioner urges the
adoption of a rule that body cavity searches must be
authorized by a warrant when time permits. It has long been held that the ordinary necessity for obtaining a warrant prior to a domestic search does not apply with full
force to border searches. See Boyd v. United States, 116
'T.S.616, 623; Carrollv. United States, 267 U. S.132, 154. But the stark contrast between permitting a minor customs official to make a warrantless search of baggage
and permitting that same official to determine the instances in which intrusive and degrading vaginal and rectal searches will be conducted demonstrates the necessity for a delineation by this Court of the exact parameters of the border-search exception.2 The record in Thompson v. United States, 411 F. 2d 946,.948, indicated that 80% to 85% of all those subjected to body cavity searches at the border are innocent of the suspected wrongdoing. This statistic shows the desirability of positing ultimate decisionmaking responsibility for this type of highly intrusive search with a "neutral and detached magistrate" rather than a zealous officer "engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime." 3
1 Rivas v. United States, 368 F. 2d'703, 710. 2Judges Ely and King indicated acceptance of petitioner's proposition but felt constrained by the existing law in the Ninth Circuit.

Petitioner was a public school teacher in Nevada. He had 'taught in the Clark County School District for seven years, and in his present position at one of the district's junior high schools for five years. He was notified in March 1971 that his contract would not be renewed for the following school year. The dismissal was upheld by a professional review committee after a hearing, and by the school board. In affirming their' actions, the Nevada Supreme Court relied on the charge of "unprofessional conduct," which was supported solely'by certain allegations concerning petitioner's views on the State's compulsory-attendance laws.
The petitioner does not believe in compulsory-attendance laws, and he did not bend his views in the, hearing before the committee. He had been quoted as saying that schools are bad for, children. But he never aired those views in h-s classroom, and he wasnever charged with encouraghig his students to be truant.
We have held that teachers may not "constitutionally be compelled to relinquish the First Amendment -rights they would otherwise enjoy as citizens to comment on matters of public interest in connection with the operation of the public schools in which they work." Pickering v. Board of Education, 391 U. S. 563, 568 (1968). There we found that the school board's dismissal of a teacher for publishing a letter critical of the'board's allocation of funds and its handling of a bond issue, was constitutionally impermissible. See also Xeyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.: S. 589 .(1967); Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U. S. 479 (1960). Just recently we

reaffirmed that principle, pointing out that it did not rely on any contractual duties: "For at ].aast a quartercentury, this Court has made clear that . . . the government . . . may not deny a benefit-to a person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected interests-especially, his interest in freedom of speech." Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U. S. 593, 597 (1972).
The court below does not directly question these principles. Instead, admitting there was no advocacy of truancy in the classroom, it found that "a teacher's right to teach cannot depend solely upon his conduct in the schoolroom." 506 P. 2d 420, 425-426. It then reached into the petitioner's family relationship, justifying the dismissal bebause of the expression of his views on attendance laws to his children, thereby "encouraging his daughters not to attend school." Id., at 425.' In thus "'carrying out" his views on compulsory-attendance laws, the court below found that he had forfeited his rights to employment.
May Pickering publish his criticisms in the local newspaper with impunity while the petitioner must keep his views secret from his children, lest they adopt them?
I would grant the petition for certiorari and set the case for argument.

Convicted by a St. Petersburg Municipal Court of' violating local ordinances, in removing a canvas mural from a wall inside the City Hall of St. Petersburg, Florida, and carrying the mural through the city streets, petitioner was subsequently convicted on a charge of grand larceny for. the same conduct." We granted certiorari, vacated the latter judgment, and remanded for further prdceedings, holding that the state appellate. court erred when it ruled that a State and' its municipalities were separate' sovereigns for purposes of the double jeopardy provisions of the Fifth-Amendment, and for that reason rejected petitioner's double jeopardy claim.. Waller v. Florida, 397 U. S. -387 (1970). On remand, the Circuit Court of Pinellas County rejected petitioner's assertion of double jeopardy on grounds-not previously reached by the state courts due to their reliance on the dual sovereignty theory-that the violations of the local ordinances and grand larceny were not the "same offense." The Florida District Court of Appeal, Second District, affirmed the judgment of conviction, 270 So. 2d 26 (1972), and the Florida Supreme Court denied a petition for a writ of certiorari.
At all times it has been conceded that the municipal and state charges arose out. of the- "same transaction or occurrence." See Waller v. Florida, supra, at 388. It is my view that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which is applicable to. the States

through the.Fourteenth Amendment, Benton v. Maryland, 395 U. S. 784 (1969), requires the prosecution, except in most limited circumstances, not present here, "to join at one trial all the charges against a defendant that grow out of a single criminal act, occurrence, episode, or transaction." Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U. S. 436, at 453-454 (1970) (BRENNAN, J., concurring); see Miller v. Oregon, 405 U. S. 1047 (1972) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting); Harris v. Washington, 404 U. S. 55, 57 (1971) (DouGLAs, J., concurring) ; Waller v. Florida,supra,at 395 (BRENNAN, J., concurring). Under this "same transaction" test, all charges-against petitioner should have been brought in a single prosecution, unless this case fell within one of the test's exceptions. See, e. g., Ashe v. Swenson, supra, at 453 n. 7, 455 n. 11. I would therefore grant the petition for certiorari and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with the views expressed in my concurrence in Ashe v. Swenson, supra.

MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom MR. JUSTICE STwART and MR. JusTicE MARSHALL concur, dissenting.
Appellants appeal from so much. of the jfidgment of the three-judge court as denied them declaratory and permanent injunctive relief in this action challenging the constitutionality of California's statutory search-andseizure provisions (California Penal Code §§ 1523-i542), as construed and applied, and as aids in the enforcement of the underlying California obscenity'statute, California Penal Code § 311.2 (a), which provides as follows:
"Every person who knowingly sends or causes to be sent, or brings or causes to be brought, into this state for sale or distribution, or in this state possesses, prepares, publishes, or prints, with intent to distribute or to exhibit to others, or who offers to distribute, distributes, or exhibits to others, any obscene matter is guilty of a misdemeanor."
It is my view that, "at least in the absence of distribution to juveniles or obtrusive exposure to unconsenting adults, the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the State and Federal Governments from attempting wholly to suppress sexually oriented materials on the basis of their allegedly 'obscene' contents." ParisAdult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U. S. 49, 113 (1973) (BPmNw~ , J., dissenting). It is clear that, tested by, that constitutional standard, § 311.2 (a) is constitutionally overbroad and therefore invalid on its face. For the reasons stated in my dissent in Millerv. California,413'U. S. 15,47 (1973), I would therefore vacate so much of the judgment of the District Court as is the subject of the appeal and remand

Appellant booksellers were convicted in the Criminal Court of the, City of New York, New York County, of promoting, or possessing with intent to promote, obscene material, knowing its content and character, in violation of N. Y. Penal Law -§ 235.05. Appellants challenged the constitutionality under the First and Fourteenth Arm'endments of N. Y. Penal. Law §.235.10 (1) (Supp. 1973-1974), which establishes a presimption tha-'a seller
of obscene material knows the contents of the material he
sells. Section 235.10 (1) provides as follows:-

"A person who promotes or wholesale promotes obscene material, or possesses the same with intent, to promote or wholesale promote it in the course of his business is presumed to do so with knoWledge of its content and character."

Obscenity for purposes of §§ 235.05 and 235.10 is defined

MR. JUsTICE BRENNAN, with whom MR. JusTicE STEw-
ART and MR. JuSTIcE MARSHALL concur, dissenting. Appellants sought in'the 44th Judicial District Court
of Dallas County, Texas, to enjoin pending and future prosecutions under Texas Penal Code, Art. 527, § 3, arising out of the seizure of motion picture films alleged to be "obscene matter" within § 3. All parties agree that Texas law permits equitable intervention in a criminal proceeding if the criminal statute involved is unconstitutional, or otherwise void, and enforcement would iesult in irreparable injury to property rights. See State ex rel. Flowers v. Woodruff, 150 Tex. Crim. 255, 200 S. W, 2d' 178 (1947). Appellants challenged the constitutionality under the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments of Art. 527, § 9 (h) Tex. Penal Code (Supp. 1972-1973), enacted as an aid to the enforcement of § 3, which is Texas' basic, criminal obscenity staiute. Section 9 (h) provides as follows:
"In the event that a search warrant is issued and matter alleged to be obscene is -seized under the provisions of this section, any person alleged to be in possession of the said matter or claiming ownership of the matter at the time of its posses-:

sion or seizure may file a notice in writing with the magistrate within 10 days of the date of the seizure alleging that the matter is not obscene and, the magistrate shall set a hearing within one day after request therefor, or at such time as the requesting party might agree, and at such hearing evidence may be presented as to the obscenity of the matter seized and-at the conclusion of such additional hearing, ,the magistrate shall make a further determination'as to the obscenity or nonobscenity of the matter. If at such hearing the magistrate finds the matter not to be obscene, then it shall be returned to the person or persons from whom it was seized."
Obscenity for purposes of Art. 527 is defined in § 1:
"(A) 'Obscene' material means material (a) the dominant theme of which, taken as -a whole, appeals to a prurient interest; (b) which is patently offensive because it affronts contemporary community standards relating to the description or representation of sexual matters; and (c) which is utterly without redeeming social value.
"(B) 'Prurient interest', means a shameful or - morbid interest in nudity, sex, or excretion, which
goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters. If it appears from the character of the material or the circumstances of its dissemination that the sub-. ject matter is designed for a specially susceptible audience,- the appeal of the subject matter shall be judged with reference to such audience." Id., § 1.
The 44th Judicial District Court denied appellants' request for relief. The Texas Court of Civil Appeals affirmed, holding that the appellants had failed to establish the unconstitutionality of § 9 (h). 488 S. W. 2d 543

It is my view that "at least in the absence of distribution to juveniles.or obtrusive exposure to unconsenting adults, the First and Fourteefith Amendments prohibit the State and Federal Governiments from attempting wholly to suppress sexually oriented materials on the basis of their allegedly 'obscene' contents." Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U. S. 49, 113 (1973) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting). Since it is clear that, when tested by that constitutional standard, the word "obscene" in §§ 3 and 9 (h), read as defined in § 1, renders §§ 3 and 9 (h) unconstitutionally overbroad and therefore facially invalid, I disagree with the holding that the appeal does not present a substantial federal question, and therefore dissent from the .Court's dismissal of the appeal.

Petitioners in this case were convicted of selling obscene books and distributing obscene motion pictures in violation of a local ordinance. They argue that, in the absence of evidence of pandering, selling to minors, or the affronting of unwilling recipients, their convictions are violative of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. In support of the .convictions, respondent relies on United States v. Reldel, 402 U. S. 351, and United States v. Thirty-seven Photographs, 402 U. S. 363.
In Stanley V. Georgia,'394 U. S. 557, this Court laid to rest the notion that a date may, consistent with the First Amendment, enforce\ an approved reading list delineating what materials the citizenry will be 4llowed privately to peruse. Wholly Aside from my own views on what the Constitution demands with respect to obscenity regulation, I fail to comprehend how the right to possession enunciated in Stanley' has any meaning when States are allowed to'outlaw the -commercial tran& actions which give rise to such possession and to prosecute any merchant who attempts to sell materials to all the Stanleys in this country. I would therefore grant this petition and reverse the convictions on the basis of Stanle, v. -Georgia,supra.

The Court today remands this case for reconsideration in light of last June's obscenity decisions. The Alabama Court oj Criminal Appeals will now decide whether the publications here are obscene in accordance with standards that no one could have- predicted at the time that these publications were sold. It must determine whether the sale of these publications, which were never offered to minors and never displayed publicly to unwilling bystanders, and for which purchase was never solicited, could constitutionally be prohibited because they "appeal [ed] to the prurient interest" of the average person applying local community standards* were "patently offensive" under such standards, and lacked "serious" literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. Miller-v. California, 413 U. S. 15, 24.
Just recently this Court reiterated:
"It is a basic principle of due process that an enactment is void for-vagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly defined. Vague laws bffend several important values. First, .because we assume that man is free to steer between lawful and unlawful conduct, we insist that laws give the person of wordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly. Vague laws may trap the innocent by not providing fair warning. Second,'. if arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for those who apply

them.f A vague law impernissibly 'delegates basic
policy-matters -to policemen, judges, .and juries for
resolution on ad hog and subjective basis, with the Attendant dangers of arbitrary and discrininatory applieation.. Third, but related, -where a vaguestatute' abuts upon sensitive. areas of basic First Amendment freedoms, it operates to -inhibit the exercise of those freedoms. Uncertain meanings inevitably lead citizens to steer' far wider of the unlawful zone than if the boundaries of the forbidden areas were clearly marked."'
The exceptions to the First. Amendment written into the Constitution by the majority, which we now ask the court below to apply on remand, could not more clearly ekhibit. these evils of yagueness. Following, the .old Roth 2 standards, the Court adopted the approach in Red'up. of deciding each case on an ad hoc basis without attempting to offer guidance for future adjudications. A new majority of five now tries again, with reworked Roth standards which allow much freer reign3to the predilections of local.authorities. But this greater latitude only exacerbates the problem of vagueness.
Every author, every bookseller, eVery movie exhibitor, and, perhaps, every. librarian is now at the inercy of the local police force's conception of what appeAs to -the "prurient interest" or is.

The meaning of the standards necessarily varies according to each person's own idiosyncrasies. The standards fair to give adequate notice and invite arbitrary exercise of police power. The evil is multiplied because of the danger to First Amendment values of free expression. "Bookselling should not be a hazardous profession." Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629, 674 (Fortas, J., dissenting). - If the magazines in question were truly -"patently offensive" to the local community, 'there would be no need to ban them'through the exercise of police power; they would be banned by the marketplace which provided no buyers for them. Thus it must be the case that some substantial portion of the public not only found them not offensive, but worthy of purchase. How can the bookseller or librarian be sure' which of the publications on his shelves are offensive to the majority? Perhaps he will be safe if he sells only publications witha certified history of broad appeal, thus attempting to "steer wide of the unlawful zone." Yet there are many who deem some magazines offensive and even lingerie advertisements in the Sunday papers. A bookseller or a librarian can Pever know if some jury will find those views representative of the community.. A movie exhibitor in Gedrgia has just found himself con-

We deal here with criminal prosecutions under which a man may lose his liberty. Our Constitution requires fair notice so that the law-abiding can conform their conduct to the requirements of the law.-
This requirement is not new, and state enactments attempting to proscribe publication of certain content have run"afoul of it before. In Winters v. New York, 333 U.

Petitioners were convicted on charges of selling allegedly obscene materials in violation of Okla. Stat. Ann., Tit. 21, §§ 1040.8; 1040.13 (Supp. 197?). Section 1040.8, among other things, makes it "unltwful for any person
to knowingly... sell ... or otherwise distribute ... any obscene book, magazine, . . . or other article which is obscene, filthy, indecent, lascivious, lewd or unfit, as defined in Title 21 of the Oklahoma Statutes, § 1040.12 . . . ." Section 104-0.13 provides in relevant part that "[e]very person who, with knowledge of its contents, . . . sells, . . . any obscene, lewd, lascivious,
filthy or indecent article . . is guilty of a misdemeanor ...
It is my view that, "at least in the absence of distribution to juveniles or obtrusive exposure to unconsenting adults, the First and Fourteenth- Amendments prohibit the State and FederalGovernments from attempting wholly to suppress sexually 9riented materials on the basis of their allegedly 'obscene' contents." ParisAdult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U. S. 49, 113 (1973) (BRENAN, J., dfssenting).

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom MR.JusTiCE BRENNAN concurs, dissenting.
Petitioner's husband, a ticket agent of the respondent railroad, was required to open the ticket office of the Mineola, Long Island, station in the early hours of a Sunday morning. In order to open the steel shutter covering the ticket window it was necessary to leave the securty of the ticket office and enter the passenger waiting room. Since there was no peephole in the shutter or in the door leading to the waiting room, there was no way for the agent to view the waiting room from the

DOUGLAS, J., dissenting

ticket office. Upon entering the waiting room, petitioner's husband encountered armed robbers who shot and killed him. Petitioner brought this suit to recover damages under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, 35 Stat. 65, as amended, 45 U. S. C. § 51 et seq.
In LiZlie v. Thompson, 332 U. S. 459, this Court held that the Act provides relief fr breach by a railroad of its duty to protect employees from foreseeable third-party assaults. In order to demonstrate foreseeability in this case, petitioner offered to prove 10 robberies or attempted robberies at respondent's stations located between five and 30 miles of the Mineola station., All had occurred within four years, and two occurred-in the month immediately preceding the Mineola holdup. Petitioner firther offered to prove communications between the ticket agents' union and respondent relating the dangers of armed .robbery and requesting the installation of peepholes and silent alarms. Since none of the prior robberies occirred at the Mineola station and none of the union communications made specific reference to the dangers at that particular station, the evidence was excluded.
After finding that petitioner had "introduced no evidence showing that [respondent] should have reasonably foreseen the possibility of a holdup at the -Mineola Station," the District Court granted respondent's motion for a directed verdict. 356 F. Supp. 1192, 1194.
As this Court has repeatedly pointed out, Congress expressed a strong preference for jury determinations of actions arising under the Act. See Roger's v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352 U. S. 500, 508. When the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to petitioner, I conclude that a fair-minded juror could well conclude that failure to provide a peephole was negligence and that. this negligence played some part in the agent's

death. The District Court thus erred in taking this case from the jury. Gallick v. B. & O..R. Co., 372 U. S. 108; Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., supra. ,
The District Court also erred in disallowing evidence which tended to establish respondent's knowledge of the hazards which ticket agents faced. Whether it was reasonable for respondent to refrain from implementihg safety suggestions at the Mineola station until the wave of robberies reached that station was for the jury to determine. The evidence of robberies at other stations and of union warnings about the dangers of robberies was relevant to that determination.
I would vacate the judgment below and remand for a new trial.

The five petitioners in this case own virtually-all the outstanding stock of a small corporation, A & S Transportation Co. (A & S). The company operates a barge. The barge fell into such disrepair as to require replacement, but A & S lacked the necessary resources and credit. A & S requested the Federal Maritime Commission to guarantee, as it is empowered by law to do,

PowELL, J., dissenting

a proposed first mortgage loan from a.bank. Before the Commission would extend its guarantee, it required of
-A & S at least $150,000 of-additional private capital. The Commission presented A & S with two options. A & S could resort either to subordinated debt or to the issuance of nonvoting, nondividend paying, noncumulative preferred stock unredeemable until full payment of the
desired loan. A & S chose the latter course.. In proportion to their
holdings of A & S common, petitioners in 1959 purchased $150,000 of preferred stock possessing all the attributes required by the" Commission. The loan was then con,summated with the Commission's guarantee, and A & S purchased a replacement vessel. By 1964 the loan was paid off in full. Having no further need for the $150,000, and in accord with the wishes. of. petitioners,1 A & S redeemed the preferred stock in 1965 and. 1966 in two equal installments. No premium was paid, and petitioners received precisely the amount each had .previously invested. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue treated
the redemptions as the receipt of ordinary income, taking
-the view that they were "essentially equivalent to -a *dividend" within the meaning of § 302 (b) (1) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U. S. C. § 302 (b) (1).

On the above facts it seems plain that the redemption of preferred stock provided -petitionersnothing more than a return of thie capital they were compelled by the Com.missioh to pay into A & S to obtaini the additional financing the corporation needed to remain in business. To tax that return of capital at. ordinary income rates is an extraordinary result, yet one that I recognize to be mandated by the full sweep of United States v. Davis, supra. )Becaiise of strong doubts- as to the correctness of any decision that. produces such a biza2rre result, I would grant certiorari to reconsider Davis.
Section 302 (b) (1) of the Code shelters from dividend -treatment, and accompanying potential- ordinary income consequences, any stock redemption that "is not essentially equivalent .to a, dividend." "' A majority of the Court in Davis read that- provision to mean that a stock redemption by a small, closely,-held corporation
21 am not unaware of the. importance of stare decis, especially
with respect to the tax Code. Yet, even in the tax area., the Court has recognized that the policies underlying stare decisis do not require "adherence to the latest decision,' however recent and questionable, when such adherenie involves collision with a prior doctrine mapre embracing 'in its scope, intrinsically sounder, and verified by experience." Heliering v. Hallook, 309 U, S. 106, 119 (1940).
3The section treats such redemptions as tax-recognizable exchanges of stock, which generally means that the capital gains provisions are applicable, to the extent that there 0s any return above basis. Section 302 provides, in pertinent part:
"Distributions in redemption of stock. "(a) Gejaeral Rule. If a corporation redeems its stock ....and I paragraph (1) .. .of'subsection (b) applies, such redemption shal be treated as a distribution in par or full payment in exchange foi the stock. "(b) Redemptions treated as exchanges.

is "always 'essentially equivalent to a dividend'" where there is no "change in the relative economic interests or rights of the stockholders " 397 U. S., at 307, 313 (emphasis added). Undoubtedly the Court sought' to promote ease.of administration through adoption of a shn*plistic, per se rule. Yet the Court explicitly recognized that the weight of authority in thelower federal courts was contrary to its; mechanical approach. Id., at 303 n. 2. 'Furthermore, the Court conceded that the "legislative history is cer.tainly not free from doubt." Id., -at 311.
In my. view, the result produced by Davis in this case -is justifiedneither by the language of -the. Code nor by the. legislative history, and certainly not by precedent prior to Davis.. .In these -circumstances; ease of administration is too high a price to pay for- the presumably unforeseen, and undeniably harsh consequences visited on these and similarly situated taxpayers.,
The Tax Court noted petitioners' position, "that the' preferred stock was no longer needed after the. loan had
been paid in full and that redemption of the stock was consistent with the business purpose for which the stock was issued." Miele v. Commissioner, 56 T. C., at 567. The Tax Court did not refute the factual correctness of this position, or consider whether there had been a tax evasion motivation.4 Rdther, that court simply disregarded all factual considerations as immaterial to an application of the Davis per se rule:
"We consider [petitioners'] argument as having been foreclosed and the issue determined by the case of United States V. Davis, 397 U. S. 301 (1970).

4 No finding was made by the Tax Court, for example, that an earned surplus was available from which ordinary dividends could have been paid.

POWELL, J., dissenting

. 414 U. S.

In Davis, the United States Supreme Court held that a redemption without a change in the relative economic interests or rights of the stockholders is always essentially equivalent to a dividend under section 302 (b) (1). It is the effect of the redemption and not the purpose behind it which is determinative of dividend equivalence." Ibid. (Citations omitted.)
MR. JUSTICE DouGLAs, dissenting in Davis with the concurrence- of THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUsTIcE BRENNAN, viewed the majority opinion as reading § 302 (b)(1) out of the Code:
"When the Court holds itj[the redemption under consideration in Davis] was a dividend, it 6ffectively cancels § 302 (b) (1) from the Code. This result is not a matter of conjecture, for the Court says that in the case of closely held or one-man corporations a redemption of stock is 'always' equivalent to a dividend." .397 U. S., at 314.
The Tax Court's decision in this case abundantly bears out MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS' view. In light of the deliberate retention of the "essentially equivalent to a dividend" language in the 1954 revision of the Code, most courts prior to Davis had assumed that § 302 (b) (1) required a factual determination as to the business purpose of the stock redemption.' Had such a factual inquiry been made in this case, it is evident that the result would have been different.
In addition to the presence of a legitimate business purpose and the absence of any evidence of tax evasion, the preferred stock in question here was nondividend paying-a highly unusual provision for a preferred

stock. Thus petitioners, having been induced by the Commission to advance additional private capital to A & S, "found themselves either locked in without income on their. investment or compelled, as- the price" of recouping it,. to pay taxes at ordinary income rates on a nonexistent gain. It is difficult to thiik of a 'more. unjust result, and yet this is the inevitable consequence of the sweeping Davis requirement that a redemption "always" be deemed "'essentially equivalent to a dividend"" in the absence of -"a change in the'relative- economic interests or rights of the stockholders." 397, U. S., at 307, 313.6'

(This 'one qualification (namely, a change in the relative economic interests or rights of stockholders) may immunize from D-3is. consequences the larger corporations, where a congrtfity of
interest between common and preferred- stockholders is found far
less frequently than in the family .type of sm'all corporations. But even where 'it can fairly be said (and often the facts as to this
are ambiguous) that there has been no such change, this does not
mean that minority stockholders are nof severely penalized by the Davis rule. In this case, the Tax Court noted t.hat the redemp'tion was made at the insistence of petitioners, who were in the unhappy position of holding nondividend preferred stock. But nothing in Davis protects a minority stockholder in a close corporation (andtheir number is legion) who may have'little or no influence as to whether or when preferred stock is redeemed. If the majority shareholder, in such a corporation'effect a pro rataredemption, a minority shareholder has no megns to avoid Davis consequences In this connection, the language of the Senate Finance Committee in restoring the "essentially equiyalent" language to § 302 of the Code is refevant. The Senate Committee stated that the House bill, which had deleted this language, "appeared unnecessarily restrictive, particularly, in the case, of redemptions of preferred stock which might be called by the corporation without the shareholder having any control over when the redemption may take place." S. Rep. No. 1622, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., 44 (1954). See United States v. Davis; supra, at 310. The truth is that minority 'shareholders, even. in close corporations, frequently have no such control.

One may recognize the tax-avoidance concern under-
lying the Court's opinion in Davi 7 without concluding that the only remedy with respect to closely held corporations is "always" to tax stock redemptions as dividends without regard to facts and circumstances. It may
indeed have- been reasonable to create a rebuttable presumption in favor of the Government, but it is
difficult to see a justification for a result. as harsh and inequitable as that often 'produced by the Davis rule. Moreover, if Congress' purpose was to enact the Davis per se rule, it could have been expressed in the simplest language.8 As the Court notes in Davis, the Senate Finance Committee deliberately chose not to take that option. Id., at-310-311.
In my view the Davis rule, often a trap for unwary investors in small businesses and facially contrary to the relevant Code provision, should be reconsidered.

8It has been suggested that since Davis, was decided March 23,
1970, Congress has had morQ than three years to repudiate or ameliorate the Davis per se rule.' With all respect, this suggestion seems unrealistic. Congress has had under consideration during this period a general revision of the Code as well
as a broad re-examination of many of the fundamental assumptions underlying the present Code. It is unlikely that piecemeal adjustments would have been made during this period of study and re-examination. *Furthermore, the Davis rule falls most heavily on small family corporations unlikely to have specialized tax counsel capable of warning that Davis has converted-§ 302. (b) (1) into "a treacherous route to be employed only as a last resort." B. Bittker & J. Eustice, supran. 7, at 9-9. It is these very corporations that are least likely to make their voices heard in Congress, since they have limited "lobbying" capabilities.

case and reverse the judgment of conviction. Rep orted

MR. JusTicE BRxNNAW, with whom MR. JusrICE STEW-, ART and MR. JusIchi MARsHAtLL concur, dissenting.
Petitioner was convicted on charges of circulating andpublishing allegedly obscene motion pictures in violation. of Neb. Rev. Stat. § 28-921, whih provides as follows:
"Whoever knowingly sells or offers for sale, br, gives. to another, or otherwise circulates or publishes or causes to be circulated or published, or has in his" possession with intent to sell, loan, or give tQ another, or to otherwise circulate or publish or cause to be circulated or published, any obscene, lewd, indecent, or lascivious book, pamphlet, paper, movie films, drawing, lithograph, engraving, picture, photograph, .model, east, or any instrument or article of obscehe, lewd, indecent or lascivious use, or advertises the same for sale, or writes or prints any letter, circular, handbill, .card, book, pamphlet, advertisement, or notice of any kind, giving'information, directly or indirectly, when, where, how, or by what means any of the articles or things hereinbefore mentioned can be purchased or otherwise ,obtained or made, shall, upon conviction thereof, be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars nor less than fifty dollars, or by imprisonment in the county jail not more than one year, or both.
It is my view that "at least in the absence of distribution to juveniles or obtrusive exposure to unconsenting adults, the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit

S. 49, 113 (1973) (dissenting opiriion). It is clear that, tested by that constitutional standard, § 28-921 is constitutionally overbroad and therefore invalid on its face. For the reasons stated in my dissent in Miller v. California,.413 U. S. 15, 47 (1973), I would therefore grant certiorari, vacate the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nebraska, and remand 'for further proceedings not inconsistent with my dissent in ParisAdult Theatre I. In that circumstance, I have no occasion to consider whether the questions presented in the petition .merit plenary review. See Heller v. New York,, 413 U.

allegedly obscene motion pictures in violation of La. Rav. Stat. Ann. § 14:106 (A) (2) (Supp. 1973), which provides as follows:
"A. Obscenity is the intentional:

"(2) Production, sale, exhibition, gift, or advertisement with the intent to primarily appeal to the prurient interest of the average person, of any lewvd, lascivious, filthy or sexually indecent written com-
position, printed composition, book, magazine, pamphlet, newspaper, story paper, writing, phonograph record, picture, drawing; motion picture film, figure, image, wire or tape recording or any written, printed or recorded matter of sexually indecent character which may or may not require mechanical or other means to be transmitted into auditory, visual or sensory representations of-such sexually indecent character."
It is my view that "at least in the absence of distribution to juveniles or obtrusive exposure to unconsentiig adults, the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the State and Federal Governments from attempting wholly to suppress sexually .oriented materials on the basis of their allegedly 'obscene' contents."'

The majority had- affirmed- on Bradley v. .United States, 410 U. S. 605. Judge Hufstedler said:
"Section 1103 (a)-of the-AComprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 provides in pertinent part: 'Prosecutions for any violation of law occurring prior to the effective date of [the Act] shallnot be-affected by the repeals . .'. made by [it] -or abated by reason thereof.' The keystone of the Bradley rationale is its construction of the Word 'prosecutions' in section 1103 (a) as 'clearly implort[ing] a beginning, and an end.' The 'end,' as Bradley squarely held;-. is the conclusion of sentencing.' The 'beginning' of a prosecution is the return of an indictment. These indictments were returned after section 176a had been repealed. There was no prosecution to be saved by section 1103 (a). Bradley means that any prosecution initiated before repeal of the statute carries with it the old section 176a penalty. Conversely, any prosecution under section 176a begun after repeal of section 176a for the substantive offense committed before repeal carries with it the milder penalties of the successor statute.
"The substantive offense was specifically saved. Prosecutions initiated before repeal were 'not . . . affected' ar 'abated,' Prosecutions begun after repeal of section 176a could be neither affected hor abated, because they were nonexistent when the old statute was repealed." 480 F. 2d, at 79.
That is my view.

MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, with whom MR. JUSTICE
DOUGLAS and MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN join, dissenting.
By an earlier per curiam opinion in this case, this Court reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals which had affirmed a District Court judgment granting Delle Rose's petition for a writ of habeas corpus. See LaVallee v. Delle Rose, 410 U. S. 690 (1973). In the view of a majority of the Court, the courts below erred in holding that, the state courts had not made an "adequate" determination within the meaning of 28 U. S. C. § 2254 (d) that Delle Rose's confession was voluntary. Since an "adequate" state court determination had been made, the District Court was wrong in imposing on -the State the burden of showing voluntariness by a preponderance of the evidence. Rather, under the terms of the presumption in § 2254 (d), the burden was on Delle Rose "to establish in the District Court by convincing evidence that the state court's determination was erroneous." 410 U. S., at 695. The Court therefore remanded the, case "for further proceedings consistent with this opinion"-presumably referring- to a redetermination by the District Court of the voluntariness issue under a corrected allocation of the burden of proof.
Upon receiving the mandate from this Court, however, the Court of Appeals did not remand the case' to the District Court for such a redetermination. Instead, without explanation, it remanded with instructions to dismiss the petition. In my view, the Court' of Appeals thereby not only misconstrued this Court's opinion, but also deprived petitioner of'his constitutional and statutory right to attempt "to establish by convincing evidence

ORDERS

MARSHALL, J., dissenting

that the factual- determination by the State court was
erroneous."' 28 U. S. C. § 2254 (d). At the outset, it seems clear from a reading of the
earlier per curiam decision that this Court never even
addressed, let 'alone' decided the question of whether
petitioner had satisfied his burden of proving erroneous
the state court finding of voluntariness. Nor would it have been proper to have done so. Neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals had yet confronted the
question, having mistakenly placed the burden of proof on the State.' As we have said in similar circumstances, "it is not our function to deal with this issue in the first instance." Swenson v. Stidham, 409 U. S.224, 231 . (1972).
This case would not be so troublesome but for the fact that the record indicates that the District Court might well *find the confession involuntary, even were the burden of proof assigned to petitioner. Indeed, in granting the petition in the first place, the District Court remarked: "Far from satisfying the State's burden of showing voluntariness by a preponderance, the evidence preponderates heavily the -other way." United States ex rel. Delle Rose v. LaVallee, 342 F. Supp. 567, 574 (SDNY 1972) (citation omitted). And certainly there is ample evidence in the record to support that factual finding. In the words of the District Court, this was
"a case of a man of little education and poor
understanding of the language; racked with physical pain and psychological distress; weakened by hunger and lack of sleep; questioned for long hours by teams of vigorous and increasingly hostile officers; not told of .his rights to silence, 'counsel, etc., but given by tone and manner. to understand that each - questioner. 'has a right to, and expects, an

answer'; shoved before television cameras after six hours or so of being moved about and assailed by his questioners in the police station; subjected to the coercion of a reenactment (including the forced placement of his hand into the seat back torn by the lethal pellets and wet with his late wife's blood) which he perceived with powerful reason as compulsory, hostile and ultimately damaging to his claims of innocence; then, finally, overpowered by the macabre-if, fortunately, rare-stunt of a visit to the morgue, 'with pious explanations thereafter . . . that serve only to highlight the quality of relentless manipulation." Id., at 574-575 (f6otnotes omitted).
It may be that the Court of Appeals did not feel that petitioner had satisfied his burden of proof. But again, the question was not for that court' ii the first instance, but rather for the District Judge, to whose "sound discretion must be left in very large part the administration of federal habeas corpus." Townsend v.- Sain, 372 U. S. 293, 313 (1963). Of course, any factual finding by the District Court would-be subject to' review by the Court of Appeals under the "clearly erroneous" standard of Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52 (a). In the first instance, however, the factual finding belongs to the trier of fact, the court which had an opportunity to hear petitioner's story and observe his demeanor, not a court of appeals.
By preventing the Distfict Court from considering whether petitioner could prove by convincing evidence that the state court determination of voluntariness Was erroneous, the Court of App6als, now with this Court's acquiescence, in effect turned the presumption of correctness in § 2254 (d) into ai irrebuttable presumption. In my view, such a result plainly foreclosed petitioner's. constitutionally guaranteed opportunity to seek relief

I would grant the writ of certiorari, reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remand the case to the District Court with instructions to reconsider, under the burden of proof set forth in this Court's earlier per curiam. opinion, whether petitioner's confession was voluntary.

"Every person who knowingly sends or causes to be sent, or brings or causes to be brought, by any means, into this state for sale or distribution, or in this state, prepares, writes, composes, stereotypes, prints, publishes, sells, offers to sell, keeps for sale, exhibits, makes, distributes, offers to distribute, or has in his possession with intent to distribute, or to exhibit or to offer to exhibit, any obscene matter', is guilty of a misdemeanor."
Obscenity for purposes of § 22-24-12 is defined by § 22-24-11 (1) as
"that which,. by contemporary standards as hereinafter set forth, considered as a whole, has as. its dominant -theme or purpose an appeal to prurient interest."
t is my -view that "at least in the absence of distribu-

tion to, juveniles or obtrusive exposure to unconsenting adults, the First-and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the State and Federal Governments from attempting wholly to suppress sexually oriented materials on the basis of their allegedly 'obscene' contents." ParisAdult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U. S.49, 113 (i973) (BRNN, J., dissenting). It'is clear that, tested by that constitutional standard, § 22-24-12, in .conjunction with § 22-2411 (1), is constitutionally overbroad and theiefore invalid on its face. For the reasons stated in my dissent in Miller v. .California,413 U. S. 15, 47 (1973), I would therefore grant certiorari, vacate the judgment of the Supreme Court of South Dakota, and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with my dissent in Paris Adult Theatre I. In that circumstance, I have no occasion to consider whether the questions presented in the petition merit plenary review. See Heller v.. New York, 413 U. S. 483, 494 (1973) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting).

BRENNAN, J., dissenting

Petitioner and the passengers in his car then overpowered the deputy and took his .38-caliber service revolver. Using that gun, petitioner forced the deputy to drive to two different houses where the deputy was kicked and, beaten. Petitioner finally released the deputy after taking his wallet. Petitioner was tried and convicted by a jury in Muskegee County, Oklahoma, for the offense of kidnaping for extortion and was sentenced to a term of 35 years' imprisonment. Subsequently, the State brought separate charges against petitioner for his possession of the deputy's service revolver. After a jury trial in Tulsa County, Oklahoma, petitioner was convicted for the offense of carrying a firearm, after former conviction of a felony (the former felonies were other than the kidnaping conviction), and sentenced to a term of 10 years' imprisonment. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals modified petitioner's term of imprisonment to five years, but otherwise affirmed the conviction, rejecting petitioner's claim that the second prosecution violated his constitutional protection against double jeopardy. See 509 P. 2d 171 (1973).
Although the charges of kidnaping for extortion andcarrying a firearm, after former conviction of a felony, both arose out of the same transaction or episode, they were prosecuted by the State in separate proceedings. That, in my opinion, requires that we grant the petition for certiorari and reverse, for I adhere to the view that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which is app'icable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, Benton v. Maryland,395 U. S.784 (1969), requires the prosecution, except in extremely .linited circumstances not present here, "to join at one trial a;ll the charges against a defendant that grow out of a single criminal act. occurrence, episode, or transaction." -Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436. 453-454 (1970) (BRENNAN, J., concurring); see Miller v. Oregon, 405 U. S.1047 (1972)

Petitioner was sentenced to eight years' imprisomnent upon his plea of guilty to a charge of burglary. Later on the same day, the same conduc.t was the basis of a charge of theft, for which he received a consecutive eightyear sentence when he also pleaded guilty to that charge. Although neither conviction was directly appealed, petitioner sought state habeas corpus, .claiming that; since both charges arose'out of the same criminal transaction, his second conviction for theft violated his constitutional protection against double jeopardy. Petitioner's application was denied by the 179th District Court of Harris County and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.
Brief for Respondent in Oppositioh 2 conceded, that the charges of burglary and theft arose out of the same criminal transaction. That, in my opinion, requires that We grant the petition for certiorari and reverse, for I adhere to the view that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which is applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.

After petitioner and one Edward"Johnson forcefully entered a St. Louis apartment occupied by Mrs. Hermine Rohs, her son Willy Rohs, and his wife Marilyn Rohs, robbed them, raped both women, and finally stabbed all three to death, petitioner was indicted on three separate charges of murder in the first degree.* The State proceeded first with the trial of petitioner for the murder of Marilyn Rohs, seeking. the death penalty. The jury convicted petitioner of first-degree murder, but assessed punishment at life 'imprisonment. Subsequently, the State tried petitioner for the murder of Willy Rohs, again seeking the- death penalty. Again the jury found petitioner guilty of first-degree murder and assessed life imprisonment. The trial judge specified that the second life sentence would run consecutively to the first'and the State thereupon entered a plea of nolle prosequi on the third indictment. The Missouri Supreme Court affirmed both convictions, rejeoing petitioner's claim that the second prosecution violated his constitutional protection against double jeopardy. See 491 S.W. 2d 257 (1973).
Although both charges of murder clearly arose out of the same transaction or episode, they were prosecuted by the State in separate proceedings. That, in my

SHALL concurs, dissenting.
Petitioner was convicted of two counts of distributing heroin in violation of 21. U. S. C. § 841 (a) (1); he later pleaded" guilty to a third count. After petitioner's plea on the third count, the' District Court sentenced him to concurrent 15-year terms on the three counts, recommending that he be given drug addiction treatment at the Federal Youth Center at Ashland, Kentucky.

OCTOBER TERM, 1973

DOUGLAS, J., dissenting

414 U. S.

It refused, however, to sentence petitioner under, the
provisions of the Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act of
1966 (hereafter NARA), 18 U. S. C. § 4251 et seq.- Petitioner claims that in the circumstances of this case the trial judge abused his discretion in refusing to'sentence
him under the NARA. The three charges against petitioner grew out of three
transactions in which he acted as a middleman, purchasing heroin from two different wholesalers for a fedeial agent. Petitioner received only a total of $15 from the three sales, which was used to buy heroin for his own personal use. Petitioner also retained some of the drug he had purchased for his own personal use.
The District Court refused to. sentence petitioner under the NARA with the possibility of early release to the community because he had "sold" heroin, and was not just a user.1 -
Under 18 U. S. C. § 4251, individuals are generally not "eligible" for NARA sentencing if they have sold narcotics; Congrdss, however, created an express exception for those who sold primarily to support their own addiction. Section 4252, on which the Court of Appeals relied in affirming the District Court, provides that if a court believes an eligible offender to be an addict, it "may" place him in the caustody of the Attorniey General to determine whether he is an addict likely to be rehabilitated through treatment. Section 4253 provides that if a court, after this study, finds that an offender is an addict and is likely to be rehabilitated, it "shall" sentence him under the NARA, with exceptions not here relevant.
1 Pet. for Cert. 11; Memorandum for United States in Opposition
3 n. 1. Similarly, the Solicitor General argues that discretion was properly exercised because petitioner was an "active conduit" of drugs who knew many drug wholesalers. Id., at 3.

DOUGLAS, J., dissenting

An individual sentenced under the NARA could be released, after six months upon a report from the Attorney General and certification from the Surgeon General that he has made sufficient progress to warrant his release under supervision; he can also be held up to 10 years if such progress is not made. 18 U. S. C. §§ 4254, 4253. After release, § 4255 provides for a program of aftercare in the community. This. aftercare, consisting of psychiatric, medical, and vocational support, was considered the crucial contribution of the NARA to drugaddiction treatment.2 It is recognized that without such ongoing aftercare, the overwhelming majority of addicts return to their habits shortly after release from prison or voluntary drug-addiction programs..

of the NARA even to addicts who are "eligible" under § 4251; the provisions of the NARA are available as an alternative and are not mandatory. See H. R. Rep. No. .1486, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 8-9, 13.
Nonetheless, it seems that Congress contemplated a more enlightened and less rigid approach to narcotics than was employed by the trial judge in the instant case.
The NARA was the product of extended consideration by the Departments of Justice, Treasury, and Health, Education, and Welfare, which stressed the necessity for flexibility in dealing with the problem of drug addiction:
"These procedures mark a fundamental reorientation toward the problem of addiction. The Attorney General in his testimony before the subcommittee stated that for too long the law had stressed punitive solutions and neglected medical and rehabilitative measures ....

... IT]he bill provides alternatives which provide a needed flexibility in the law. The practical effect of the implementation of the law provided for in the bill, is that strict punishment can be meted out where required to the hardened criminal, while justice can be tempered with judgment and fairness in those cases where it is to the best interest of society and the individual that such a course be followed.
".. . The testimony presented at the hearings has clearly shown the need for the flexible approaches
provided by civil commitment and postconviction commitment which--ould be made possible by this legislation." Id., at 8-9.

without more, in curing drug addiction, and that individuals will generally return to addiction when released from prison even if their physiological habits have been broken. It also explicitly acknowledged that addicts, like- petitioner, will engage in criminal activity to support their habits and that they will often spread addiction to others. Id., at 11; S. Rep. No. 1667, 89th Cong., -2d Sess., 13. Weighing these considerations, Congress determined -that even those who sold druigs, if they did so pfimarily to support their own habits, should be eligible for NARA consideration. The exception for addicts who sold to support their own habits was not created casually or without consideration. . .Civil Coinmitment -and Treatment of Narcotic Addicts, Hearings before Subcomiiittee No. 2 of the House Conimittue
on the Judiciary, 89th Cong., 1st and 2d -Sess., -ser. 10, pp. 84-85 (statement of Attorney General Katzenbach). It was felt that the exception did not endanger public safety or allow the NARA to be abused. See Hearings on the Narcotic [Addict] Rehabilitation Act of 1966 before a Special Subcommittee of the Senate Jutici-
ary Committee, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 18 (1966) (stateinent of Attorney General Katzenbach). * The District Court Judge in this case effectively*wriote
this coiigressional determination out of the NARA, sinde he apparently refused to extend the benefits of the Act to petitioner because petitioner had "sold" drugs. This was the ineffective and, inflexible treatment into which
judges were forced before the passage of the NARA and which Congress attempted to cure; it does not seem con-
sonant with the congressional purpose to continue .sichi simplistic treatment of the problem of addiction after* the NARA is available, I would grant certiorari. V-acate the judgment below, and remand the case for fuller .consideration of the advisability of treatment under the NARA.

MR. JUSTICE WHITE, with whom MR. JUSTICE DoUG-
LAs joins, dissenting.
Petitioner Martin Fitzpatrick was convicted for the first-degree murder of two police officers in Sherrill, New York. The police followed reliable leads and located a house owned by Fitzpatrick in Syracuse. After atterhping to get a response from inside, the police entered the house through a door which had .been left ajar. As they came to a room on the second floor, petitioner called out from a closet in which he was hiding: "Don't shoot. I give up." The officers seized and handcuffed him, and took him out into the hall. The police then questioned Fitzpatrick abbut the gun he had used, after advising him of his rights. He stated that it was in the closet where he had been found. The gun was retrieved from the closet and it was subsequently identified as the murder weapon at trial.
At a suppression hearing, the trial judge determined that petitioner hil not been sufficiently apprised of his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966), and ruled his oral statements to the police inadmissible. The trial court nevertheless admitted the. gun into evidence, rejecting petitioner's contention that 'it be excluded as fruit of the Poisonous tree. Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U. S. 471 (1963Y. The trial court adopted what has been termed the rule of "inevitable discovery," stating "proper police investigation would [in dny event] have resulted in a search of that closet and [the gun's] discovery." The New York Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the search was not inconsistent with Chimel v. California,395 U. S.752 (1969), and also adopted the inevitable-discov.ery rule.

November -19, 1973

Chimel held that a warrantless search of premises incident to arrest was justified when limited to "a search of the arrestee's person and the-area 'withini his immediate control'--construing that phrase to mean the area-.from within whi6h .he might gain possession of a weapon or destructible evidence;" Id., at 763. This limitation lends substance to petitioner's claim- that this search of a closet in a foom while an arrestee is handcuffed in a hall in the presence of police cannot be justified. At the very -least, a substantial issue of compliance with Chimel is posed and is deserving of this Court's
*attention. Of equal importance is the adoption by the New
York Court of -Appeals of the inevitable-discovery rule. The rejection of that rule by the Second Circuit, United States v. Paroutian, 299 F. 2d 486 (1962), where evidence was discovered as the "fruit" -of an illegal search, may pose a dilemma -for law enforcement officials in the State of New York.- Mor6over, if the fruits -doctrine applies to exclude evidence obtained as a result of statements made after improper Miranda warnings, compare Miranda,supra,at 476-477, with Harrisv. New York, 401 U. S. 222 (1971), it is a significant constitutional question whethei&the "independent source" exception to inadmissibility of fruits, Wong Sun, supra, at 487-488, encompasses a hypothetical as well as an actual independent source.

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting.
This case involves., the suiciency and objectivity- of an Environmental Impacr, Statement- (EIS) preL:ared in connection with the construction of the Reef Runway Project at Honolulu'International Airport. The project is a 12,000-foot runway to be built offshore on filled reefland in the Keehi Lagoon. The construction will involve the dredging of some 14.million cubic yards of coral-and silt, consuming over 1,200 acres-of ocean coral reef. The EIS, required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969,1 was prepared in this case as a "joint project" by- the Federal Aviation Agency, the State of Hawaii, and the Ralph M. Parsons Company.' The problem, as the Court of Appeals noted, is that Parsons is a private firm under contract to render management consulting services for the project in the -event it is approved and thus has a strong "financial interest i an affirmative decision on the proposed project." 485 F. 2d 460, 467 (CA9 1973). The court, however, found 'nothing "in either the wording of NEPA- or the. case law which indicates that, as a matter of law, a firm with a fi-ancial interest in the project-may not assist with the dfafting of the EIS." Ibid.
It seems to me a total frustration of the entire purpose of NEPA to entrust evaluation of the environmental factors to a firni with a multimillion-dollar stake in the

83 Stat. 852, 42 U. S, C. § 4321 et seq. 2 As the court below notes: "[Ajn employee of Parsons testified

by a decisionmaking mechanism resting largely on the advice of vested-interest groups.' A longstanding policy of listening only to those with enough money to be heard has left our country scarred with a continuum bf environmental abscesses. The oil-auto-concrete interests have long urged the necessity of paving over the countryside with highways. The same oil interests which argued the advisability of offshore drilling at Santa Barbara pressed for a trans-Alaska pipeline and obtained a concession in the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act that in effect exempted the pipeline from NEPA to the extent that it curtailed judicial review.'

mation void underlying our national decisioinaking mechanism. Congress knew what happens when we heed the counsel only of those who measure national advancement by GNP and the Dow Jones industrial, average. Congress knew that. we can trust them to supply us with valuminous economic data, but it also knew that we cannot trust them to supply us with an improved quality of life. They are not advocates of the interests of mountains, forests, streams, rivers, oceans, and coral beds, or of the wildlife that inhabit them, or the people who enjoy them. They are not useful when it comes to appraising the values of an unspoiled meadow or glacier or reef, for they think only in terms of dollars. They lack the sensitivity to be entrusted with evaluating what effect dredging will have on our estuaries. These estuaries are essential in part of the life cycle of two-*thirds of the marine life. Dredging makes these estuaries biological deserts for years to come. Congress knew that the final say on these environmental matter's should not be under the direct or indirect control of thoK who plan to make millions out of their destruction.
The people have long heard and too long heeded the advice of those with a monetary stake. NEPA was designed to augment that information with an analysis of other factors. Whether that analysis can be undertaken by those -whose economic voice is already heard is an issue as yet undecided in this Court.' It. is an issue worthy of our determination and should be decided before the ongoing construction of the Reef Runway does irreparable injury to -the environmental interests here

The finality of the judgment in this case, at least with respect to the double jeopardy claim, is squarely decided by Harrisv. Washington, 404 U. S. 55, 56 (1971). After being found not guilty by reason of.insanity and committed, the petitioner sought habeas corpus relief in the Missouri Supreme Court, challenging the statute under which he was committed. That court found that peti-* tioner was indeed improperly confined- under the statute, since he should never have been acquitted. The judgment of acquittal was vacated and the case was remanded

with instructions that "[i]f it is determined that petitioner is mentally fit to proceed, the criminal proceedings may be resumed." On June 29, 1973,. the trial court found petitioner competent and set the case for trial on October 29, 1973. Petitioner's attorney has informed the clerk's office that a continuance has been granted and trial is currently set for December 3, 1973. The essence of petitioner's double jeopardy claim, raised and rejected below on petition for rehearing, is that he may not again be tried. The decision that he may be so tried is final for purposes of 28 U. S. C. § 1257:
"Sirice the state courts have finally rejected a claim that the Constitution forbids a second trial of the petitioner, a claim separate and apart from the question whether the petitioner may constitutionally be convicted of the crimes with which-he is charged, our jurisdiction is properly invoked under 28 U. S. C. § 1257.' Harrisv. Washington, supra, at 56.
In Harris the Washington Supreme Court denied a writ of prohibition to stay a trial which petitioner claimed was barred by double jeopardy. In this case petitioner, on petition for rehearing, unsuccessfully objected to the Missouri Supreme Court's determination that criminal proceedings be resumed -upon a finding of competence, and the St. Louis Circuit Court has ordered petitioner to stand trial in accordance with the Missouri Supreme, Court mandate. Although his constitutional objections to the commitment statute may not b6 -properly before us since petitioner is no longer committed under the statute, the double jeopardy claim is properly reviewable at th~is point since his objection to standing trial has been rejected and petitioner has been ordered to stand trial in accordance with the mandate, of the State's highest court.
The issue as posed should at least be set for argument.

MARSHALL, J., dissenting

Petitioner sought certiorari on the ground that he had been denied the opportunity to have the jurors examined as to racial bias, a right this Court guaranteed in Aldridge v. United States, 283 U. S.308 (1931). We granted certiorari and remanded for reconsideration in light of Ham v. South Carolina,409 U. S. 524 (1973). On remand, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts again upheld the conviction. - Mass. - , 296 N. E. 2d 810 (1973).
The importanhce of the right at issue here-the opportunity to ascertain the racial-bias of the veniremen-can hardly be gainsaid. The right to trial by an "2impartial jury" is a.cornerstone of our system of justice.
"[T-he right to jury trial guarantees to the criminally accused a fair. trial by a panel of impartial, 'indifferent' jurors. The failure to accord an accused a fair. hearing violates even the minimal standards of due process.... In the language of Lord Coke, *ajuror must-be as 'indifferent as he stands unsworne.' Co. Litt. 155b. His verdict must be based upon the evidence developed at the trial. Cf. Thompson v. "City of Louisville, 362 U. S.199. This is true', regardless of the heinousness of the crime charged, the apparent guilt of the offender or the station in life which he occupies. It was so written into our law as early as 1807 by Chief Justice Marshall in 1:Burr's Trial 416 (1807). 'The theory of the law is that a juror who has formed an opinion canhot be impartial.'

Accordingly, in Ham v. South Carolina,supra,MR. JusTiCE REHNQUIST, writing for a unanimous Court,3 found constitutional error in a state court trial judge's refusal to propound a specific question on racial prejudice to the veniremen in the trial of a Negro for possession of marihuana.4
"The State having created [the] statutory framework for the selection of juries, the essential fairness required by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that under the facts shown by this record the petitioner be permitted to have the jurors interrogated on the issue of racial bias." 409 U. S., at 527.
Nonetheless, on remand, the Massachusetts court read our decision in Ham as limited by the particular circumstances of that case-the trial of a civil rights worker in the South. The State court found that petitioner, unlike Ham, was not likely to be a "special target for racial prejudice" and, therefore, that the trial judge did not err in refusing to make the requested inquiry.
This distinction is supported by neither logic nor precedent. MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST explained the basis for the Court's decision in Ham as follows:
"The inquiry as to racial prejudice derives its constitutional stature from the firmly established prece-
dent of Aldridge [v. United States] and the numer-
3 Although the Court was unanimous on this issue, the author and MR.JusTicm DouGLAs dissented on another ground. /4 In Ham, as in the case before us, the trial judge asked only the general questions about bias provided for by statute. This Court observed that while a trial judge is not required-to put the question about racial prejudice in the exact form suggested by the defendant, the question must be "sufficient to focus the attention of prospective jurors on any racial prejudice they might entertain." 409 U. S., at 527. The Court found the general questions propounded by the trial court insufficient for that purpose.

ous state cases upon which it relied, and from a principal purpose as well as from the language of those who adopted the, Fourteenth Amendment." Id., at 528.
In Aldridge v. United States, -283 U. S. 308 (1931), Mr. Chief Justice Hughes, writing for the Court, found that the "essential demands of fairness" required the trial judge to interrogate veniremen as to racial prejudice' in the trial of a Negro for murdering a white policeman.
The Court observed that "[n]o surer -way. could be devised to bring the processes of justice into disrepute"than to "permit it to be thought that.persons entertaining a disqualifying prejudice were allowed to serve as jurors and that inquiries designed to elicit the fact of disqualification were barred." Id., at 315.
The A.idridge Court was not concerned-with whether petitioner was unpopular, in the community-a special target of prejudice-but rather with the potential racial "bias of the particular jurors who are to try the accused." Id., at 314. The Court did not rely. on any particular circumstances to justify its requirements other than the fact that "the possibility of such prejudice [against Negroes] is [not] so remote as to justify the risk in forbidding the inquiry." Ibid.' (Footnote omitted.) Nor did the Court purport to limit its holding to any region because the "question is not... the dominant sentiment of the community .... - Ibid.
In Ham, this Court reaffirmed its commitment to the holding of Aldridge and clarified its constitutional underpinnings. - The Court emphasized the compelling nature of an inquiry into racial prejudice-the principal target of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court also indi-

cated the importance of the state cases' of which the AIdridge Court said:
"The practice of permitting questions as to racial prejudice is not 6onfined to any section of the country, and this fact attests the widespread sentiment that 'fairness demands that such inquiries be allowed." Id., at 313.
The principle -that fairness demands such inquiry is, if anything, far more pervasive today than it was when Aldridge was decided, in both federal and state courts.'
Yet, the Massachusetts court, by its holding, requires a Negro defendant to establish that he is a special target for racial prejudice before being entitled to an inquiry on racial bias during the voir dire of the jury. In Aldridge, this Court weighed the Government's interests in refusing such a question, where it observed that:
"If in fact [the jurors] were found to be impartial, no harm would be done in permitting the question; but if any one of them was shown to entertain a

prejudice which would preclude his rendering a fair verdict, a gross injustice would be perpetrated in allowing him to sit." Id,,at 314.
The state court should not be permitted to restrike that. -balance.
Finally, to say that petitioner is not a potential target of racial prejudice -would be to ignore as judges what we must all know as men. That petitioner was tried in Boston, Massachusetts, while Gene Ham was tried in Florence, South Carolina, is of no consequence. Racial prejudice is a cultural malady that has shaped our history as a nation. It is a cancer of the mind and spirit which breeds as prolifically in the industrial cities of the North as in the rural towns of the South.' And where, as here and in the strikingly similar circumstances of the Aldridge case, a Negro is being accused of an attack. on a white policeman, it would be disingenuous at best to assert that he is.not apt to be a particular target of racial prejudice.
To deny this petition for certiorari is to see our decision in Ham v. South Carolina stillborn and to write an epitaph for those "essential demands of fairness" recognized by this Court 40 years ago in Aldridge. . fear that we "bring the processes of justice into disrepute" not only by sanctioning the denial of a right required by "essential demands of fairness" but also in failing to compel compliance by -the court below with a precedent of this Court barely a year since decided. I would grant the petition.

Petitioners are male Pawnee Indians who are students at Pawnee Junior High Schuol, a public school in Oklahoma. They sought to wear their hair parted in the middle with a '.]-ng braid on each side so that, in thqeir words, they coula" follow the "old traditional ways"

and because such a hairstyle was "one way of telling people .that I am proud [to be an Indian]." Others testified that young Indians sought to wear braided hair because of a new-found pride in their heritage, in an attempt to "regain their tradition, to learn their culture."
These youths were suspended from school indefinitely on April 24, 1972,' for being in violation of a school hair-length regulation, which forbids hair reaching the shirt collar or ears. The Court of Appeals justified the suspension on "the ground that the regulation was rational in that it sought to achieve the objective of "instilling pride and initiative among the students leading to scholarship attainment and high school spirit and morale." The court stressed testimony from one school superintendent that a school system cannot countenance different groups and still remain one organization.
Petitioners claim, inter alia, that the school hair-length restriction unjustifiably impinges 'on the freedom of expression guaranteed them by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. This Court has consistently, over my dissents, refused to review lower court decisions passing on the constitutionality of school hair-length regulations, whether such regulations have been upheld or struck down, and regardless of the grounds on which the lower courts have reached their conclusions. I have noted the deep division among the Circuits on this issue, and have thought that it is an issue of particular personal interest to many and of"considerable constitutional importance. See Freeman v. Flake, 405 U. S. 1032; 01ff v. East Side Union High School District,404 U. S. 1042.
'The suspension was stayed by a preliminary injunction of the District Court which apparently ran from May 1, 1972, to June 5, 1972, and apparently also by a stay entered by the Court of Appeals which ran from July 6, 1973, to September 4, 1973. Respondents claim that the suspension of petitioners. was not permanent, but this is contradicted by the Court of Appeals' opinion.

DOUGLAS, J., dissenting

Petitioners were not wearing their hair in a desired style simply because it was the fashionable or accepted style, or because they somehow felt the need to register an inchoate discontent with the general malaise they might have perceived in our society. They were in fact attempting to broadcast a clear and specific message to their fellow students and others-their pride in being Indian. This, I believe, should clearly bring this case within the ambit of Tinker v. Des Moines School District, 393 U. 'S. 503, where we struck down a school policy which refused to allow students to wear black armbands in protest of the Vietnam war. We recognized that such armbands were closely akin to pure speech and were entitled to First Amendment protection,id., at 505506, at least where, as here,2 there was no finding that" the operation of the school was substantially endangered by the symbolic speech:
"In order -for the State in the person of school officials to justify prohibition of a particular expression of opinion, it must be able to show that its action was caused by something more than a mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantiess that always accompany an unpopu'tar viewpoint. Certainly where there is no finding and no showing that engaging in -the forbidden conduct would 'materially and substantially interfere with the requirements of appropriate disciplire in the

2Petitioners claim that "[r]espondents admitted that petitioners'
traditional hairstyle has never caused any disruption in -he school." Respondents do not contradict'this statement, but only assert that the regulation on length of hair "bears a rational relationship to a legitimate state objebtive, i. e., that of instilling pride and initiative among the students leading to scholarship attainment and school spirit and morale."

operation of the school,' the prohibition cannot be sustained." Id., at 509.
As previously noted, there was an opinion voiced by school officials that allowing petitioners to wear their hair in an Indian manner while restricting the hair length of white students would somehow be "disruptive," in that an "integrated school system cannot countenance different groups and remain one organization." But as we noted in Tinker, this Court long ago recognized that our constitutional system repudiates the idea that a State may conduct its sch'ools to "'foster a homogeneous people.'" Id., at 511. In Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390, 402, the Court said:
"In order to submerge the individual and develop ideal citizens, Sparta assembled the males at seven into barracks and intrusted their subsequent education and training to-official guardians. Although such measures havte been deliberately approved by men of great genius, their ideas touching the relation between individual and State were wholly different from those upon which our institutions rest; and it hardly will be affirmed that any legislature could impbse such restrictions upon the people of a State without doing violence to both letter and spirit of the Constitution."
And in Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U. S.589, 603, we stated:
"'The vigilant protection of constitutional freedoms is nowhere more vital than in the community of American schools.' Shelton v. Tucker, [364 U. S. 479,1 487. The classroom is peculiarly the 'marketplace of ideas.' The Nation's future depends upon leaders trained through wide exposure to that robust exchange of ideas which discovers truth 'out

of a multitude of tongues, [rather] than through any kind of authoritative selection.'"
The effort to impose uniformity on petitioners is especially repugnant in view of the history of vhite treatment of the education of the American Indian. In the late 1800's, at about the same time that the Dawes Severalty Act of 1887 fragmented Indian tribal land holdings and allotted land to individual Indians with the effect of breaking up tribal structures,' the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) began operating a system of boarding schools with the express policy of stripping the Indian child of his cultural heritage and identity:
"Such schools were run in a rigid military fashion, with heavy emphasis on rustic vocational education. They were designed to separate a child from his reservation and family, strip him of his tribal lore and mores, force the complete abandonment of his native language, and prepare him for neveI again returning to his people." 4

Again in 1944, a House Select Committee on Indian Affairs offered the same recommendation for achieving the "'finaf solution of the Indian problem' ": "'The goal ·of Indian education should be to make the Indian child a better American rather than to equip him simply to be a better Indian.' "5
A massive study by the Senate Special Subcommittee on Indian Education, "Indian Education: A National Tragedy-A National Challenge," S. Rep. No. 91-501, reviewed this policy, which it found rooted in a "selfrighteous intolerance of tribal communities and cultural,

differences." Id., at 21. The Subcommittee found that many teachers in BIA schools
"still see their role as that of 'civilizing the native.' . . . One consequence of the unfortunate situation is a serious communications breakdown between student and staff and a serious lack of productive student-staff interactions.
" . BIA administrators and teachers believe that Indians can choose only between total 'Indianness'-whatever that is-and complete assimilation into the dominant society. There seems to be little if any understanding of acculturation processes or the desirability of 'combining a firm cultural identity with occupational success and consequent, selfesteem.' " Id., at 61-62.
The same study found that similar attitudes often exist in public schools which educate Indian students.'
The results of such a policy, mirrored in the policy of the school in this case to force all students into one

"A. An anti-Indian. attitude is often prevalent in white communities in which Indians receive public school education.

their tracking systems. "C. Some administrators refuse to -cooperate with the Indian
community in their school district and discourage 6r-do~not permit Indian participation in decisionmaking.
"D. Indians are often promoted each year regardless of grades just so they can be kept in school, thus assuring the local district of receiving Federal aid because of the presence of Indian students. One public school district goes so far as to falsify Indian achievementtest results because the students were so far behind national norms that 'it just wouldn't look good.'

homogeneous mold even when it impinges on their racial and cultural values, have been disastrous for the young Indian child who is taught in school that the culture in which he has been reared is not important or valid. The Subcommittee recognized that such a coercive assimilation policy, denigrating and seeking to abolish cultural differences, frustrates Indian children and leads "[tihe comi-iunity and child [to] retaliate .by treating the school as an alien institution." Id., at 21. At least in part as a result of such alienation, American Indians in both public and federal schools have a dropout rate twice the national average. Id., at .ix. Only 33% of Indians over the age of 25 have completed high school, and the median number of school years completed by this group is only 9.8.' Even when an Indian youth nominally remains in school, his achievement level is generally 2 to 3 years below that of .white students in the same grade, and the Indian child falls progressively further behind the longer he remains in school.8

DOUGLAS,. being of the view that state obscenity regulation is prohibited by the Fourteenth and-First Amendments (see Paris Adult Thetre I v. Slaton, 413 U. S. 49, 70 (DOuGLAS, J., dissenting)), would grant certiorari and reverse the judgment of conviction. Reported below: 495 S. W. 2d 906.
MR. JusTicE BRENNAN, with whom, MR. JUSTICE STEWART and MR. JusTICE MARSHALL join, dissenting.
Appellant was convicted for .exhibiting an obscene motion picture in violation of Texas Penal Code, Art. 527, § 3 (Supp. 1973), which provides:
"Every person who knowingly: seids or causes to be sent; or brings or causes to be brought, into this state for sale or distribution, or in-this state prepares for distribution, publishes, prints, exhibits, distributes, or offers to distribute, or has in his possession with intent to distribute or to exhibit or offer to distribute, any obscene matter is guilty of a misdemeanor."
Obscenity for purposes of ftt. 527 is defined in § 1:
"(A) 'Obscene' material means miterial (a) the dominant theme of which, taken as a whole, appeals to a prurient interest; (b) which is patently offensive because it affronts contemporary community standards relating to the description or representation of sexual matters; and (c) wnich is utterly without redeeming social value.
"(B) .'Prurient interest' means a shameful or morbid iAterest in nudity, sex, or excretion, which goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or representation of such. matters. If it appears from the character of the material or the circumstances of its dissemination that the subject matter is designed for a specially susceptible

1120

audience, the appeal of the subject m~atter shall be judged with reference to such audience."
It is my view that, "at least in the absence of distribution to juveniles or obtrusive exposure to unconsenting adults, the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the State and Federal Governments from attempting wholly to suppress sexually oriented materials on the basis of their allegedly 'obscene' contents." garis Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U. S. 49, 113 (1973) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting). It is clear that, when tested by that constitutional standard, the word "obscene" in § 3, read as defined in § 1, renders § 3 unconstitutionall.y overbroad and therefore facially invalid.
For the reasons stated in my dissent in Miller v. California,413 U. S. 15, 47 (1973), I would therefore vacate the judgment below and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with my Paris Adult Theatre I dissent. In that circumstance, I have no occasion to consider at this time whether, if § 1 were properly narrowed, appellant's challenge to the constitutionality of § 9 of Art. 527, pursuant to which the subject film was seized, would merit plenary review. See Heller v. New York, 413 U. S. 483, 495 (1973) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting).

MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom MR. JusTICE STEWART and MR. JusTiCE MARSHALL join, dissenting.
Petitioner was convicted on charges of selling obscene motion pictures in violation of § 311.2 (a) of the California Penal Code (1970), which provides as follows:
'Every person who knowingly sends or causes to .be sent, or brings or causes to be brought, into this state for sale or distribution, or in this state possesses, prepares, publishes, or prints, with intent to distribute or to exh.ibit - to others, or who offers to distribute, distributes, or. exhibits to others, any obscene matter is guilty of a misdemeanor."

It is clear that, tested by that constitttional standard, § 311.2 (a) is constitutionally overbroad and therefore invalid on its face. For the reasons stated in my dissent in Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, 47 (1973), I would therefore grant certiorari, vacate the

STEWART, J., dissenting

marriage under state law. Section 76-1-36, Utah Code
Ann. (1953), provides:
"A sentence of imprispnment in the state prison for any term less than for life suspends all civil rights of the person so sentenced during such imprisonment, and forfeits all private trustsand all public offices, authority or power."
In implementation of this statute, the Utah State Board of Corrections promulgated Policy No. 36:
"It shall be the policy of the Board of Corrections that the Warden may, upon the recommen'dation of the treatment team, authorize inmate nearing their release dates to marry."
This policy has been interpreted and applied by the state corrections officials to permit marriage by an inmate only when he is within six months of release if the marriage is recommended by the treatment team. Easthope and appellant conveyed their desire to marry to the warden of the Utah State Prison, who determined that Easthope was not within the terms of the -policy and denied permission for the marriage to take place. Appellant then brought this action for mandamus in the state courts to require the warden to sanction the marriage.
Appellant contends that the freedom to marry is constitutionally protected and that the State, of Utah cannot prohibit her marriage to Easthope in the absence of some compelling state interest. The interest that the State has asserted in support of its policy is. that the denial of such civil rights, in conjunction with their gradual return' to the convict, "acts as an incentive for the convict to aid in his own rehabilitation." The Utah courts have denied the appellant any relief, and the State Supreme Court explicitly rejected the appellant's constitutional claim.

414 U.S.

In Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 (1967), the Court expressly recognized that the right to -marry is one of the fundamental liberties embodied in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See also Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U. S. 535, 541 (1942). Just last Term, the Court reaffirmed the principle of those cases. Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973). The extent to which this right may be diluted for one in prison is something the Court has never decided. In this case the State asserts no security or discipline problems that would arise by permitting the marriage. The State's only interest appears to be to utilize the wholesale denial and subsequent "gradual return" of prisoners' civil rights as an incentive to encourage their cooperation in corrective programs. While this may or may not constitute good psychology and sound corrections policy, I think there is a serious question whether this state policy is sufficient to overcome the appellant's constitutional claim.
I would not, however,.note probable jurisdiction and set this case for oral argument. The State has suggested that the issue presented may well have been mooted when Utah Code Ann. § 76-1-36 (1953), on which Policy No. 36 was predicated, was recently repealed by the legislature. Accordingly, I would vacate the judgment of the Utah Supreme Court and remand the case to that court to consider whether the repeal of the statute has operated to nullify the Board of CorrectionsL Policy No. 36.

.MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, whom MR. JUSTICE STEWART

Petitioner *as convicted on charges .of circulating and publishing allegedly obscene motion pictures in violation of § 28-921 of the Nebraska Revised Statutes (Supp. 1972), which provides'as follows:
"Whoever knowingly sells or offers for sale, or gives to another, or otl~erwise circulates or .publishes or

causes to be circulated or published, or has in his possession with intent to sell, loan, or give to another, or to otherwise circulate or publish or cause to be circulated or published, any obscene, lewd, indecent, or lascivious book, pamphlet, paper, movie films, drawing, lithograph, engraving, picture, photograph, model, cast or any instrument or article of obsce.ne, lewd, indecent or lascivious use, or advertises the same for sale, or"writes or priiits any letter, circular, handbill, card, book, pamphlet, advertisement, or notice of any kind, giving information, directly or indirectly, when, where, how, or by what means any of the articles or things hereinbefore mentioned can be purchased or otherwise obtained or made, shall-, upon conviction thereof, be punished by a fine of not more than ne thousand dollars nor less than fifty dollars, or by imprisonment in the county jail not more than one year, or both ...
The "standard for judging obscenity" in prosecutions brought under § 28-921, set out in § 28-926.07 (1964), is
"whether to the average person the dominant theme of said material or conduct which is at issue in such . . . criminal proceedings, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, which is to excite lustful thoughts, or a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex, or excretion which goes substantially beyond the customary limits of candor."
It is nry view that "at least in the absence of distribution to juveniles or obtrusive exposure to unconsenting adults, the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the State and Federal Governments from attempting wholly to suppress sexually oriented materials on the basis of their allegedly 'obscene' contents." ParisAdult Theatre I v-Slaton, 413 U. S. 49, 113 (1973) (dissent-

ing opinion). It is clear that, tested by that constitutional standard, § 28-921 is constitutionally overbroad and therefore invalid on its face. 'For the reasons stated in my dissent in Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, 47 (1973), I would therefore grant certiorari, vacate the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nebraska, ana remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with my dissent in ParisAdult Theatre I. In that circumstanc., I have no'occasion to consider whether the questions presented in the petition merit plenary review. See Hellerv. New York, 413 U. S. 483,494 (1973) (BLENNAU¢, J., dissenting).

This case involves a demonstration occasioned by the appearance of President Nixon at a week-long Billy Graham East Tennessee Crusade held at a football stadium in Knoxville. The petitioner, an ordained MIethodist minister and a professor of religious studies, was convicted under a Tennessee statute which in relevant part proscribes "willfully disturb[ing] or disquiet[ing] any assemblage of- persons met for religious worship .. . by 'noise,profane discourse, rude or indecent behavior, or any other act."' Disruption of the meeting is not an element of the crime under the statute, and the jury was instructed that "if you find from the evidence that the defendants indulged in any indecent or improper conduct, so near the worshipping assembly, if you find that there was a. worshipping-assembly present on this occasion, as to attract the notice and attention of persons who were present as a part of the assemblythen, under such a state of facts, if they exist, the defendants would be guilty; and this would be so, whether witnesses say they were disturbed or not." (Bill of Exceptions 518.) No evidence was introduced at trial that

"If any person willfully disturb or disquiet any assemblage of persons met for religious worship, or for educational or literary purposes, or as a lodge or for the purpose of engaging in or promoting the cause of temperance, by noise, profane discourse, rude or indecent behavior, or any other act, at or near the place of meeting, he shall be fined not less than twenty dollars ($20.00) nor more than two hundred dollars ($200), and may also be imprisoned not exceeding six (6) mouths in the county jail." Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-1204 (1955).
The jury imposed a fine of $20 upon petitioner; no prison sentence was imposed.

the meeting was disrupted, in the sense that speakers were shouted down, or that petitioner's group prevented, or sought to prevent, the meeting from proceeding as planned. Nor did the state appellate courts make any
such findings in affirming the conviction. Although there were findings that some members of the protest group engaged in obscene chants, it is uncontested that petitioner did not. The undisturbed findings of the State Court of Criminal Appeals were that petitioner "did not chant obscenities and that his intent was for a peaceful demonstration." Petitioner's contentions that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad were rejected by the state courts.
Petitioner's involvement in the demonstration began the day before when he learned of the President's planned appearance. In consultation with administration officials of the University of Tennessee he participated in planning the demonstration and urged the group to make their protest silently through hand-held signs. On the night of the protest the stadium was filled to capacity with about 75,000 persons; there were approximately 300 demonstrators. Despite earlier plans, the group did engage in a number of chants, and petitioner joined in some of them. The only violence occurring during the evening was the knocking of a collection plate from an usher's hands. Many members of the group, including petitioner, joined in retrieving the. money and placing it back in the plate.
Petitioner contends that the part of the meeting relevant to this case-the portion during which Dr. Graham introduced President Nixon, and the President spokewas political rather than religious. He points out that the platform included prominent state Republican figures but no Democrats and contends that the content of the

1166

DOUGLAS, J., dissenting

414 U. S.

President's message was primarily political.2 We are bound, however, by the state court's determination that for purpose of the state statute the meeting was religious, and that the statute reached petitioner's conduct. We must then consider petitioner's contentions that, given this construction, the statute as applied here was either unconstitutionally vague or overbroad.
The statute in relevant part proscribes "willfully disturb[ing] or disquiet[ing] any assemblage of persons met for religious worship ...by noise, profane discourse, rude or indecent behavior, or any other act." Since it is uncontested that petitioner did not engage in "profane discourse" or "indecent behavior"'I the only proscriptions applicable here are those against "noise," "rude behavior" or "any other acts" disturbing the meeting. We have frequently passed upon statutes with similar language. In Coates v. City of Cincinnati,402 U. S. 611, we considered an ordinance proscribing assemblies of three or more persons conducting themselves in a manner "annoying" to passersby, and- concluded that the term "annoy" without further clarification specified "no
standard of conduct.., at all." Id., at 614. In Ashton v. Kentucky, 384 U. S, 195, we found fatally vague a
criminal prohibition on "writing calculated to create

Brock, a Republican then running for the Senate seat held by Democrat Albert Gore, and Republican Congressmen Kuykendall and Duncan. Bill of Exceptions 348. No prominent Democrats were included.
3Neither the court below nor the petition here distinguished between facial and as-applied claims of vagueness or overbreadth.
4 There was behavior by others in the group which might have fallen within these proscriptions. Among the chants which petitioner did not engage in were "Bullshit, bullshit" during the President's speech, and "One, two, three, four, we don't want your fucking war." One isolated member of the group rose during a minister's prayer and screamed an obscenity.

disturbances of the peace" because such a standard "involves calculations as to the boiling point of a particular person or a particular group." Id., at 200. - Cf. T'erminiello v. Chicago, 337 U. S. 1.
The addition of "willful" to the statutory prohibition on disturbing the meeting adds no greater. precision, since this element of intent is not proved separately but was inferred from the conduct constituting the violation. Indeed, all 'the, direct evidence of petitioner's intent was to the contrary.' Nor. is the specification of "noise" or "rude behavior" helpful under the facts of this case. We may assume that a State can constitutionally protect religious congregations from unwanted and disruptive intrusions, and it seems probable that men of common intelligence would understand the statute to proscribe organized political chants in the' midst of'a Sunday morning service at a neighborhood church. But societal norms of appropriate conduct vary with the nature of the meeting in question. Thus what constitutes "rude behavior" or sufficient noise to disturb the assembled group depends upon calculations of the expectations of other members of the group, much as was the case in Ashton v. Kentucky, supra. Cf. In re Kay, 1 Cal. 3d 930, 464 P. 2d 142 (1970). This imprecision in the statute is highlighted by the facts of this case. '
The meeting in question here was widely advertised and all were invited, and the attendance the night of President Nixon's appearance was. apparently considerably above the number present other nights.. Thus

5In Colten v. Kentucky, 407 U. S. 104, the Court affirmed a conviction under'a disorderly conduct statute against claims of vagueness and overbreadth. But Colten, unlike the present case; did not involve expression protected under the First Amendment, and in Colten the petitioner disobeyed a lawful police order to move on.

there can be no question that petitioner had a right to be present. Vendors roamned the audience of 75,000 selling refreshments and there was a general noise level created by the crowd throughout the proceedings.' People came and went regularly. And at least during the-period relevant here-Dr. Graham's introduction and the President's speech-the crowd frequently interrupted the proceedings with applause to indicate their approval of the speaker.s It was in this context that the petitioner was required to gauge 'vhat conduct would be appropriate. and lie made a conscientious effort to do so. Although before the meeting he had argued vigorously for keeping the protest silent, as the content of the speeches became political he joined several chants of the crowd.' During Dr. Graham's introduction he joined the chant "Politics, politics" to show his disapproval of what he considered to be a political intrusion into a meeting that was supposed to be religious. And during the President's talk he chanted "Peace now" and "Stop the War." But clearly he considered obscene chants inappropriate, and not only refrained from joining those but spent some effort in attempting to persuade others in the crowd to refrain also. And it must be remembered that during this period others in the crowd were applauding the speakers, and that none of the activities of the petitioner or of his group were 'violent or disruptive of the meeting in the sense that they prevented it, or sought to prevent it, from proceeding as planned.
7Id., at 117. 8 Id., at 272. SThere was evidence that others clearly sympathetic to the Graham religious cause joined the protest becaise they Were offended by the political overtones of this part of the meeting. Two other ministers, who had been converted at previous Graham cnsades and who were then attending a Graham training school, testified that they joined in the protest. Id., at 299-320.

Such facts would,. of course, present a different case. Here
it would seem we have no more than that the petitioner's expression of his views was found disturbing by others.
I find it. difficult to conclude that the petitioner was given fair notice under the statute that his conduct was proscribed. Petitioner had to guess not only as to the
conduct proscribed by the statute at the meeting in question, but-whether the statute applied at all to this portion
of the meeting, which could be characterized as political as well as religious. "No one may be reqiired at peril of life, liberty or property to speculate as to the meaning of penal statutes. All are entitled to be informed as to what the State commands or forbids." Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U. S. 451, 453. And here, where the statute is capable of interpretation reaching expression protected" by the First Amendment, the greatest precision is required. Ashton v. Kentuck , 384 U. S., at 200-201; Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 109. Moreover this statute as applied here exhibits the twin defect of inviting "arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement" and of inviting prosecutors and juries to proceed on their prejudices, because of its failure to specify sufficiently what is proscribed. Grayned, supra, at 108. Those disturblng the meeting with applause were not prosecuted, although the applause of the much larger group presumably disturbed those in the audience who did not support the President. Thus it appears that the statute allows for arbitrary enforcement on the basis of who is disturbed.
Moreover, because disruption of the meeting is not an element of the offense, the statute poses substantial problems of overbreadth. Under -the instructions given by the trial judge, the jury was allowed to convict petitioner for "improper conduct" attracting the notice of persons present. This would appear to sanction conviction by the jury for doing no more than expressing views

unpopular with the assembled crowd, if the jury found
that such expression was improper to the occasion, and thus disturbed others. Such a conviction cannot stand
under the First Amendment, any more than the convic-
tion in Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U. S. 1, 'where the jury was allowed to convict the defendant for speech which "stirg the public to anger, invites dispute, brings
about a condition of unrest, or creates a disturbance."
Id., at 4.
The theory under which the intermediate state appellate court affirmed the conviction poses further problems.
under the First Amendment. Apparently concluding that petitioner did nothing at the meeting itself which was violative of the statute, the State Court of Criminal Appeals sustained the'conviction on the theory that petitioner was an aider and abettor because he "admits to protesting the appearance of the President, and he admits to participating in th6 organizing of the protest." On this basis the court held that "the obscenities from the group and the chanting by the group ... are also [petitioner's] acts by his participation in the group." The court concluded that petitioner "cannot escape responsibility for his participation in planning the demonstation by relating he personally himself did not do the unlawful acts, which arose during the event." The State Supreme Court, in affirming, rejected the aider-and-abettor reasoning of the lower court because under state law there can be no conviction for aiding andabetting a misdemeanor. The conviction was affirmed, however, because "the conduct of [petitioner] cited by the Court of Criminal Appeals as amounting to aiding and abetting, actually makes [petitioner] guilty as a principal. offender." This is-followed by citations to state court decisions holding that as to misdemeanors evidence showing aiding and abetting supports conviction as a principal. It thus appears

that petitioner's conviction was ailrmed because of his association with other members of the -group whose .behavior was found violative of the statiite.
-By grounding petitioner's -onviction on his participation in the planning of the protest the state appellate courts place criminal liability on freedom of expression in its most pristine form. Petitioner's role, was not contested. He attended the meetings and voiced his approval of some form of protest against the President's appearance, but it appears that at virtually every opportunity he urged the group to keep its protest peaceful and silent. He cannot' be held liable because some members of the group chose to express their views in an illegal manner United States v. Robel, 389 U. S. 258, particularly when, as here, there is no evidence 'that the group ever agreed to conduct its protest unlawfully Or that petitioner ever acquiesced in such a decision.1° Nor was petitioner -charged with conspiracy.

ANTITRUST ACTS. 1. Clayton Act-Bank merger-Effect of failure to show alterna-
tive methods of entry.-In civil antitrust action under § 7 of Clayton Act to challenge proposed merger between two commercial banks in State of Washington, Government's failure to establish that acquiring bank has alternative methods of entry offering a reasonable likelihood of producing significant procompetitive effects is determinative of its contention that without regard to possibility of future deconcentration of Spokane market, challenged merger is illegal because it eliminates acquiring bank as a perceived potential entrant. Assuming that commercial bankers in Spokane are aware of regulatory barriers that render acquiring bank an unlikely or insignificant potential entrant except by merger with target bank, it is improbable, in light of such barriers, that acquiring bank exerts any meaningful procompetitive influence over Spokane banks by "standing in the wings."

ANTITRUST ACTS-Continued.
under § 7 of Clayton Act challenging proposed merger between two commercial banks in Connecticut, District Court must make a determination as to geographic market in which each of the banks operates and to which bulk of its customers may turn for alternative commercial bank services, and in making that determination it will be aided by following considerations: (i) Government has burden of producing evidence to define localized banking markets; (ii) in satisfying that burden (as District Court correctly held) Government cannot rely only on Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas; and (iii) town boundaries, although significant, are not controlling. United States v. Connecticut National Bank, p. 656.
3.Clayton Act-Bank merger-"Line of commerce!'--In a civil antitrust action by United States under § 7 of Clayton Act challenging proposed merger between two commercial banks in Connecticut, District Court erred in holding that appropriate "line of commerce" within meaning of § 7 included both commercial banks and savings banks. United States v. Connecticut National Bank, p. 656.
4. Clayton Act-Bank merger-Potential-competitiondoctrinePrima facie case.-In civil antitrust action under § 7 of Clayton Act to challenge proposed merger between two commercial banks in State of Washington, Government's evidence of concentration ratios in Spokane commercial banking market established a prima faci3 case that that market was sufficiently concentrated to invoke potential-competition doctrine, and appellee banks did not demonstrate that such ratios inaccurately depicted economic characteristics of Spokane market. United States v. Marine Bancorporation, p. 602.
5. Clayton Act-Bank merger-Relevant geographic market.-in a civil antitrust action by United States under § 7 of Clayton Act challenging proposed merger between two commercial banks in Connecticut, District Court erred in ruling that relevant geographic market is State as a whole. In a potential-competition case like this, relevant geographic market must be defined as localized area in which acquired bank is in significant, direct competition with other banks, albeit not acquiring bank. United States v. Connecticut National Bank, p. 656.
6. Clayton Act-Bank merger-Relevant product ahd geographic markets.--As "a necessary predicate" to deciding whether proposed merger between two commercial banks in State of Washington contravenes Clayton Act, District Court properly found that relevant product market was "business of commercial banking" and

ANTITRUST ACTS-Continued.
that relevant geographic market was Spokane metropolitan area. Entire State is not, despite Government's contrary contention, an appropriate "section of the country" within meaning of § 7 of Act, since for purpose of this case appropriate "section of the country" and "relevant geographic market" are same, being area in which acquired firm is an actual, direct competitor, and since moreover Government has not shown that effect of merger on a statewide basis "may be substantially to lessen competition" within meaning of § 7. United States v. Marine Bancorporation, p. 602.
7. Clayton Act-Bank merger---"Section of the country."-In civil antitrust action under § 7 of Clayton Act challenging proposed merger of two commercial banks in Connecticut, Government's contention that State as a whole, though not a banking market, is a "section of the country" within meaning of § 7 is without merit. United States v. Connecticut National Bank, p. 656.
8. Clayton Act-Bank merger-Target bank-Failure of proof as to future expansion.-In civil antitrust action under § 7 of Clayton Act to challenge proposed merger of two commercial banks in State of Washington, record amply supports District Court's finding that Government "failed to establish . . . that there is any reasonable probability that [target bank] will expand into other banking markets," since at no time in its 70-year history has target bank established branches outside Spokane area, acquired another bank, or received a merger offer other than one at issue here. United States v. Marine Bancorporation, p. 602.
9. Clayton Act-Bank merger-Violation-Failureof proof.-In view of legal barriers to entry, notably state-law prohibitions against de novo branching, branching from branch office, and multibank holding companies, Government failed to sustain its burden of proof that challenged merger between two commercial banks in State of Washington violates § 7 of Clayton Act by eliminating likelihood that, but for the merger, acquiring bank would enter Spokane de novo by means of sponsorship-acquisition or through a foothold acquisition of a small state bank in Spokane area, since it was not shown that either of proposed alternative methods of entry was feasible or offered a substantial likelihood of ultimately producing deconcentration of Spokane market or other significant procompetitive effects.

10. Clayton Act-Market extension mergers-CommercialbanksPotential-competition doctrine-Federal and state regulations.While geographic market extension mergers by commercial banks must pass muster under potential-competition doctrine, application

of doctrine to commercial banking must take into account extensive and unique federal and state regulatory restraints on entry into that line of commerce, including controls over number of bank charters to be granted, prior bank regulatory agency approval of opening of branches, and state-law restrictions, such as those in Washington involved in this case, on de novo geographic expansion through branching and multibank holding companies.

I. Due Process.
1. Art. 134, Uniform Code of Military Justice-Lack of vagueness.-This Court will not decide whether District Court had jurisdiction of an action challenging a court-martial conviction under Art. 80 of UCMJ of an attempt to commit an offense under Art. 134, on ground, inter alia, that Art. 134 is unconstitutionally vague, since assuming, arguendo, that District Court did have jurisdiction, decision in Parkerv. Levy, 417 U. S. 733, requires reversal of Court of Appeals' decision on merits reversing District Court's denial of relief and holding that Art. 134 is unconstitutionally vague. Secretary of the Navy v. Avrech, p. 676.
2. Obscenity-Federalcriminal statute-Notice.--Title 18 U. S. C. § 1461, making it a crime to mail obscene matter, when "applied according to the proper standards for judging obscenity do[es] not . . . fail to give men in acting adequate notice of what is prohibited." Hamling v. United States, p. 87.
3. Obscenity-Federal criminal statute-Vaguenes&.-Construing 18 U. S. C. § 1461, making it a crime to mail obscene matter, as being limited to sort of "patently offensive representations or description of that specific 'hard core' sexual conduct given as examples in Miller v. California [413 U. S. 15]," statute is not unconstitutionally vague, it being plain that brochure in question is a form of hard-core pornography well within permissibly proscribed depictions described in Miller. Enumeration of specific categories of obscene material in Miller did not purport to proscribe, for purposes of § 1461, conduct that had not previously been thought criminal but instead added a "clarifying gloss" to prior construction, making statute's meaning "more definite." Hamling v. United States, p. 87.
4. Obscenity-Federalcriminal statute-Vagueness;--Rejectionin Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, of "social value" formulation of Memoirs v. Massachusetts, 383 U. S. 413, did not mean that 18 U. S. C. § 1461, making it a crime to mail obscene matter, was unconstitutionally vague at time of petitioners' pre-Miller convictions because it did not provide them with sufficient guidance as to proper test of "social value," that formula having been rejected

1310

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW-Continued.
not for vagueness reasons but because it departed from obscenity definition of Roth v. United States, 354 U. S. 476, and entailed a virtually impossible prosecutorial burden. Hamling v. United States, p. 87.
5. Prison disciplinary proceedings-A prisoner is not wholly stripped of constitutional protections, and though prison disciplinary proceedings do not implicate full panoply of rights due a defendant in a criminal prosecution, such proceedings must be governed by a mutual accommodation between institutional needs and generally applicable constitutional requirements. Wolff v. McDonnell, p. 539.
6. Prison disciplinary proceedings-Loss of good-time credits-Minimal requirements.--Since prisoners in Nebraska can only lose good-time credits if they are guilty of serious misconduct, procedure for determining whether such misconduct has occurred must observe certain minimal due process requirements (though not full range of procedures mandated in Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U. S. 471, and Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U. S. 778, for parole and probation revocation hearings) consonant with unique institutional environment and therefore involving a more flexible approach reasonably accommodating interests of inmates and needs of institution. Wolff v. McDonnell, p. 539.
7. Prison disciplinary proceedings-Retroactivity.--Courtof Appeals erred in holding that due process requirements in prison disciplinary proceedings were to be applied retroactively by requiring expunging of prison records of improper misconduct determinations. Wolff v. McDonnell, p. 539.
8. Summary punishment for contempt-Lack of opportunity to be heard.-Respondent trial judge's conduct, in proceeding summarily after state criminal trial to punish petitioner counsel for accused for alleged contempt committed during trial without giving him an opportunity to be heard in defense or mitigation before he was finally adjudged guilty and sentence was imposed, does not square with Due Process Clause of Fourteenth Amendment. Reasonable notice of specific charges and opportunity to be heard are essential in view of heightened potential for abuse posed by contempt power. Taylor v. Hayes, p. 488.
II. Equal Protection of the Laws.
1. Disenfranchisement of felons-California, in disenfranchising convicted felons who have completed their sentences and paroles, does not violate Equal Protection Clause of Fourteenth Amendment. Section 1 of Fourteenth Amendment, which contains Equal Protec-

INDEX

1311

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW-Continued.
tion Clause, in dealing with voting rights as it does, could not have been meant to bar outright a form of disenfranchisement that was expressly exempted from less drastic sanction of reduced representation that § 2 imposed for other forms of disenfranchisement. Richardson v. Ramirez, p. 24.
2. No political ads on city rapid transit system.-Judgment holding that city's refusal to permit political advertising on its rapid transit system did not violate a candidate's equal protection rights, is affirmed. Lehman v. City of Shaker Heights, p. 298.
I. Executive Privilege.
1. Presidentialcommunications-Criminaltrial-Generalizedassertion. -Although courts will afford utmost deference to Presidential acts in performance of an Art. II function, when a claim of Presidential privilege as to materials subpoenaed for use in a criminal trial is based, as it is here, not on ground that military or diplomatic secrets are implicated, but merely on ground of a generalized interest in confidentiality, President's generalized assertion of privilege must yield to demonstrated, specific need for evidence in a pending criminal trial and fundamental demands of due process of law in fair administration of justice. United States v. Nixon, p. 683.
2. Presidentialcommunications-Criminaltrial-In camera inspection.-Neither doctrine of separation of powers nor generalized need for confidentiality of high-level communications, without more, can sustain an absolute, unqualified Presidential privilege of immunity from judicial process under all circumstances. Absent a claim of need to protect military, diplomatic, or sensitive national security secrets, confidentiality of Presidential communications is not significantly diminished by producing material for a criminal trial under protected conditions of in camerainspection, and any absolute executive privilege under Art. II of Constitution would plainly conflict with function of courts under Constitution. United States v. Nixon, p. 683.
IV. Federal Obscenity Prosecution.
Instruction to jury-National community standards-P.ropriety.In federal prosecution for mailing obscene matter occurring prior to Miller v. California,413 U. S. 15, instruction to jury on application of national community standards of obscenity was not constitutionally improper, since in rejecting view that First and Fourteenth Amendments require that proscription of obscenity be based on uniform national standards, the Court in Miller and companion cases did not require as a constitutional matter substitution of some

1312

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW-Continued.
smaller geographical area into same sort of formula; test was stated in terms of understanding of "average person applying contemporary community standards." The Court's holding in Miller that California could constitutionally proscribe obscenity in terms of a "statewide" standard did not mean that any such precise geographic area is required as a matter of constitutional law. Reversal is required in pre-Miller cases only where there is a probability that excision of references to "nation as a whole" in instruction dealing with community standards would have materially affected deliberations of jury. Hamling v. United States, p. 87.
V. First Amendment.
1. Freedom of speech---"fmproper use" flag statute.-Washington's "improper use" statute forbidding exhibition of United States flag to which is attached or superimposed figures, symbols, or other extraneous material, as applied to appellant's activity in displaying out of his apartment window a United States flag upside down with a peace symbol taped thereto as a protest against then recent actions in Cambodia and fatal events at Kent State University, impermissibly infringed a form of protected expression. Spence v. Washington, p. 405.
2. Freedom of speech-No political ads on city rapid transit system.-Judgment holding that city's refusal to permit political advertising on its rapid transit system did not violate a candidate's free speech rights, is affirmed. Lehman v. City of Shaker Heights, p. 298.
3. Freedom of speech-Obscenity-Constitutionalstandards-State obscenity statute-Film's lack of patent offensiveness.-Film "Carnal Knowledge" is not obscene under constitutional standards announced in Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, and appellant's conviction of violating Georgia obscenity statute for showing film in a theater therefore contravened First and Fourteenth Amendments. Juries do not have unbridled discretion in determining what is "patently offensive" since "no one will be subject to prosecution for the sale or exposure of obscene materials [that do not] depict or describe patently offensive 'bard core' sexual conduct . . . ." This Court's own view of film impels conclusion that film's depiction of sexual conduct is not patently offensive. Camera does not focus on bodies of actors during scenes of "ultimate sexual acts," nor are actors' genitals exhibited during those scenes. Film shows occasional nudity, but nudity alone does not render material obscene under Miller's standards. Jenkins v. Georgia, p. 153.

INDEX
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW-Continued.
4. Freedom of speech-Obscenity-Federalcriminalstatute.-Title 18 U. S. C. § 1461, making it a crime to mail obscene matter, when "applied according to the proper standard for judging obscenity do[es] not offend constitutional safeguards against convictions based upon protected material." Hamling v. United States, p. 87.
5. Freedom of the press-"Right of reply" statute.-Florida's "right of reply" statute which grants a political candidate a right to equal space to answer criticism and attacks on his record by a newspaper, and makes it a misdemeanor for newspaper to fail to comply, violates First Amendment's guarantee of a free press. Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tomillo, p. 241.
VI. Regulation of Attorney-Prisoner Mail.
State may constitutionally require that mail from an attorney to a prisoner be identified as such and that his name and address appear on communication; and-as a protection against contraband-that authorities may open such mail in inmate's presence. A lawyer desiring to correspond with a prisoner may also be required first to identify himself and his client to prison officials to ensure that letters marked "privileged" are actually from members of bar. Wolff v. McDonnell, p. 539.
VII. Sixth Amendment. Right to jury trial-Contempt In case of post-verdict adjudica-
tions of various acts of contempt committed during trial, Sixth Amendment requires a jury trial if sentences imposed aggregate more than six months, even though no sentence for more than six months was imposed for any one act of contempt. Codispoti v. Pennsylvania, p. 506.
VIII. State Obscenity Prosecution.
Instruction to jury-Community standards-There is no constitutional requirement that juries be instructed in state obscenity cases to apply standards of a hypothetical statewide community-Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, approving, but not mandating, such an instruction-and jurors may properly be instructed to apply "community standards," without a specification of "community" by trial court. Jenkins v. Georgia, p. 153.

1. Attorney-Finaldispositionof charges-Substitutionof judges.Because it appears from record that "marked personal feelings were present on both sides" with respect to respondent trial judge and petitioner counsel for accused during state criminal trial, and that marks of "unseemly conduct [had] left personal stings," another judge should have been substituted for respondent for purpose of finally disposing of contempt charges against petitioner. Taylor v. Hayes, p. 488.
2. Right to jury trial-Alleged contemno.r-Though a crime carrying more than a six-month sentence is a serious offense triable by jury, an alleged contemnor is not entitled to a jury trial simply because a strong possibility exists that upon conviction he will face a substantial term of imprisonment regardless of punishment actually imposed. Codispoti v. Pennsylvania, p. 506.
3. Right to jury trial-Petty offenses.-Since no more than a sixmonth sentence was actually imposed, the eight contempts for which petitioner, as counsel for accused during state criminal trial, was adjudged guilty, whether considered singly or collectively, constituted petty offenses and hence trial by jury was not required. It is not improper to permit State, as in this instance, after conviction, to reduce a sentence to six months or less rather than retry contempt with a jury, since "criminal contempt is not a crime of the sort that requires the right to jury trial regardless of the penalty involved." Taylor v. Hayes, p. 488.

1. Labor disputes-Erroneous instruction to jury.-In appellee letter carriers' libel actions against appellant union for including appellees in "List of Scabs" published in union's newsletter, trial court's instruction defining malice in common-law terms was erroneous and reflected a misunderstanding of Linn v. Plant Guard Workers, 383 U. S. 53, which adopted reckless-or-knowing-falsehood test of New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254. Letter Carriers v. Austin, p. 264.
2. Labor disputes-Robust debate-Executive Order-Federalemployment.-Federal labor laws favor uninhibited, robust, and wideopen debate in labor disputes. Relevant law here, in appellee letter carriers' libel actions against appellant union for including appellees in "List of Scabs" published in union's newsletter, is Executive Order No. 11491, governing labor relations in federal employment. Basic provisions of Executive Order are like those of National Labor Relations Act, and similarly afford wide latitude for union freedom of speech. Partial pre-emption of Linn v. Plant Guard Workers, 383 U. S. 53, by which federal law pre-empts state law to extent that State seeks to make actionable defamatory statements in labor disputes published without knowledge of their falsity or reckless disregard of truth, is thus equally applicable here. Letter Carriers v. Austin, p. 264.
3. Labor disputes-State law as pre-empted by federal lawr-Although Linn v. Plant Guard Workers, 383 U. S. 53, held that federal labor law does not completely pre-empt application of state laws to libels published during labor disputes, that decision recognized that federal law does pre-empt state law to extent that State seeks to make actionable defamatory statements in labor disputes published without knowledge of their falsity or reckless disregard of truth. Letter Carriers v. Austin, p. 264.
4. Plaintiff attorney as neither public official nor public figure.Petitioner, an attorney who had represented a murder victim's family in civil litigation against policeman convicted of committing murder, was neither a public official nor a public figure for purposes of his libel action against respondent for having published an article in its magazine which falsely stated that petitioner bad arranged policeman's "frameup," implied that petitioner had a criminal record, and labeled him a "Communist-fronter." Neither petitioner's past service on certain city committees nor his appear-

5. Privatepersons-Preclusionof presumed or punitive damages.States may not permit recovery of presumed or punitive damages in defamation actions when liability is not based on knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for truth, and private defamation plaintiff who establishes liability under a less demanding standard than test of New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, may recover compensation only for actual injury. Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., p. 323.
6. Private persons-Public issue-Applicability of New York Times standard-A publisher or broadcaster of defamatory falsehoods about an individual who is neither a public official nor a public figure may not claim protection of New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, against liability for defamation on ground that defamatory statements concern an issue of public or general interest. Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., p. 323.
7. Private persons-State standard of liability.-So long as they do not impose liability without fault, States may define for themselves appropriate standard of liability for a publisher or broadcaster of defamatory falsehood which injures a private individual and whose substance makes substantial danger to reputation apparent.

is clear that District Court's denial of President's motion to quash comported with Rule 17 (c) and that Special Prosecutor has made a sufficient showing to justify a subpoena for production before trial. United States v. Nixon, p. 683.
2. Subpoenaed material-Presidentialcommunication&s-In camera examination.-On basis of this Court's examination of record, it cannot be concluded that District Court erred in ordering in camera examination of certain Presidential tape recordings and documents produced, pursuant to Rule 17 (c), under subpoena duces tecum before criminal trial of certain staff members of White House and political supporters of President, which material shall now forthwith be transmitted to District Court. United States v. Nixon, p. 683.
3. Subpoenaed material-Presidentialcommunications-In camera examination-Release.-Since a President's communications encompass a vastly wider range of sensitive material than would be true of an ordinary individual, public interest requires that Presidential confidentiality be afforded greatest protection consistent with fair administration of justice, and District Court has a heavy responsibility to ensure that material involving Presidential conversations irrelevant to or inadmissible in criminal prosecution of certain staff members of White House and political supporters of President, ordered produced before trial under subpoena duces tecum, pursuant to Rule 17 (c), be accorded high degree of respect due a President and that such material be returned under seal to its lawful custodian.

hearings in federal habeas corpus cases. Wingo v. Wedding, p. 461. 2. Evidentiary hearings-Prohibitionagainst magistrate's conduct-
ing hearings-Invalidity of local rule of court.--It is clear from text. and legislative history of Federal Magistrates Act that Congress did not intend to alter requirements of 28 U. S. C. § 2243, and therefore local rule of District Court, insofar as it authorizes fulltime magistrate to hold habeas corpus evidentiary hearings, is invalid because it is "inconsistent with the ... laws of the United States" under § 636 (b) of Act, and because § 636 (b) itself precludes a district judge from assigning a magistrate duty of conducting an evidentiary hearing and limits magistrate's review to proposing, not holding, such a hearing. Wingo v. Wedding, p. 461.
3. Evidentiary hearings-Prohibitionagainst magistrate'sconducting hearings-Invalidity of local rule of court-Electronic record-

purpose to reflect. basic principle that a capital expenditure may not be deducted from current income, as well as regulations indicating that for purposes of § 263 (a) "amount paid out" equates with "cost incurred," there is no question that cost of respondent taxpayer's transportation equipment used in constructing capital facilities was "paid out" in same manner as other construction-related items, such as supplies, materials, and wages, which taxpayer capitalized.

2. Federal prosecution-Voir dire examination-Sufficiency-Compliance with Fed. Rule Crim. Proc.24 (a) .-- District Court's voir dire examination in federal criminal prosecution was sufficient to test qualifications and competency of prospective jurors and complied with Rule 24 (a), and that court did not constitutionally err in not asking certain questions propounded by petitioners. Hamling v. United States, p. 87.

Dispute between Special Prosecuto.r and President-Production of Presidential tapes and documents.-Dispute between Special Prosecutor and President as to whether District Court in criminal prosecutions of certain staff members of White House and political supporters of President lacked jurisdiction to issue subpoena duces tecum for certain Presidential tape recordings and documents as to which President claimed executive privilege, because matter was an intrabranch dispute between a subordinate and superior officer of Executive Branch and hence not subject to judicial resolution, presents a justiciable controversy.

carriers' libel actions against appellant union for including appellees in "List of Scabs" published in union's newsletter together with pejorative. definition of "scab" using words like "traitor," state award did not comport with protection for freedom of speech in labor disputes recognized in Linn v. Plant Guard Workers, 383 U. S. 53. Use of epithet "scab," which was literally and factually true and is common parlance in labor disputes, was protected under federal law. Publication of pejorative definition was likewise not actionable, since use of words like "traitor" cannot be construed as representations of fact and their use in a figurative sense to manifest union's strong disagreement with views of workers opposing unionization is also protected by federal law.

1. Advertising brochure-Sufficient evidence-Test-Jury's determination that advertising brochure with sexually explicit photographic material related to illustrated version of official report on obscenity, was supported by evidence and was consistent with obscenity formulation of Memoirs v. Massachusetts, 383 U. S. 413. Hamling v. United States, p. 87.
2. Mailing obscene matter-Admissibility of evidence-Comparable materials.-District Court in prosecution for mailing obscene matter did not abuse its discretion in excluding allegedly comparable materials (materials with second-class mailing privileges, or judicially found to have been nonobscene, or available on newsstands), since, inter alia, expert testimony bad been allowed on relevant community standards; and similar materials or judicial determinations with respect thereto do not necessarily prove nonobscenity of materials accused is charged with circulating; and with respect to whether proferred evidence is cumulative, clearly relevant, or confusing, trial court has considerable latitude. Hamling v. United States, p. 87.
3. Mailing obscene matter-Inconsistency in verdicts-Separability.-In federal prosecution for mailing an obscene illustrated version of an official report on obscenity and an advertising brochure relating to such illustrated report, inability of jury to reach verdict on counts charging distribution of illustrated report had no relevance to its finding that brochure was obscene, consistency in verdicts not being required, and brochure being separable from illustrated report. Hamling v. United States, p. 87.

INDEX
OBSCENITY-Continued.
4. Mailing obscene matter-Jury instruction as to panderingSince evidence of pandering can be relevant in determining obscenity, as long as proper constitutional definition of obscenity is applied, it was not improper for District Court in prosecution for mailing obscene advertising brochure to instruct jury in connection with test of Memoirs v. Massachusetts, 383 U. S. 413, that it could also consider whether brochure had been pandered by looking to manner of its distribution and editorial content. Hamling v. United States, p. 87.
5. Mailing obscene matter-Juryinstruction on prurientappeal.In prosecution for mailing obscene advertising brochure, District Court's instruction that in deciding whether predominant appeal of brochure was to a prurient interest in sex jury could consider whether some portions appealed to a specifically defined deviant group as well as to average person was not erroneous, since in measuring prurient appeal, jury (which was instructed that it must find that material as a whole appealed generally to a prurient interest in sex) may consider material's prurient appeal to dearly defined deviant sexual groups. Ilamling v. United States, p. 87.
6. Mailing obscene matter-Jury instructions on scienter.--District Court in prosecution for mailing obscene matter did not err in its instructions to jury on scienter, including its instruction that "[petitioners'] belief as to the obscenity or nonobscenity of the materials is irrelevant," it being constitutionally sufficient that prosecution show that a defendant had knowledge of contents of materials that he distributes, and that he knew character and nature of materials. Hamling v. United States, p. 87.
7. Mailing obscene matter-Pre-Miller conduct-Effect of applicability of Miller standards.-Standards established in Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, and companion cases do not, as applied to petitioners' pre-Miller conduct, require a reversal of their convictions for mailing obscene matter. Defendants like petitioners, who were convicted prior to decisions in Miller cases but whose convictions were on direct appeal at that time, should receive any benefit available to them from those decisions. Hamling v. United States, p. 87.
8. Mailing obscene matter-Sufficiency of indictment.-Indictment under 18 U. S. C. § 1461 for mailing obscene matter was sufficiently definite. Language of § 1461 was not "too vague to support conviction for crime," and indictment gave petitioners adequate notice of charges against them, since at time petitioners were indicted statutory term "obscene," a legal term of art and not a generic ex-

SCHOOL DESEGREGATION.
1. Interdistrict segregation-Consolidationor cross-district remedy-Necessary showing-Before boundaries of separate and autonomous school districts may be set aside by consolidating separate units for remedial purposes or by imposing a cross-district remedy, it must be first shown that there has been a constitutional violation within one district that produces a significant segregative effect in another district; i. e., specifically, it must be shown that racially discriminatory acts of state or local school districts, or of a single school district have been a substantial cause of interdistrict segregation. Milliken v. Bradley, p. 717.
2. Metropolitan area plan-Erroneous standard.--DistrictCourt, in desegregating Detroit schools, erred in using as a standard declared objective of a metropolitan area plan which, upon implementation, would leave "no school, grade, or classroom . . . substantially disproportionate to the overall pupil racial composition" of metropolitan area as a whole. Clear import of Swann v. Board of Education, 402 U. S. 1, is that desegregation, in sense of dismantling a dual school system, does not require any particular racial balance. Milliken v. Bradley, p. 717.
3. School district lines-Interdistrictrelief-While boundary lines may be bridged in circumstances where there has been a constitutional violation calling for interdistrict relief in desegregating schools, school district lines may not be casually ignored or treated as a mere administrative convenience; substantial local control of public education in this country is a deeply rooted tradition. Milliken v. Bradley, p. 717.
4. Single-district de jure violations-Propriety of multidistrict, areawide remedy.--Relief ordered by District Court and affirmed by Court of Appeals, consisting of desegregation plan encompassing 53 of 85 outlying suburban school districts plus Detroit, was based upon erroneous standards and was unsupported by record evidence that acts of outlying districts had any impact on discrimination found to exist in Detroit Echools. A federal court may not impose a multidistrict, areawide remedy for single-district de jure school segregation violations where there is no finding that other included school districts have failed to operate unitary school systems or have committed acts that effected segregation within other districts, no claim or finding that school district boundary lines were established with purpose of fostering racial segregation, and no meaningful opportunity for included neighboring school districts to present evidence or be heard on propriety of a multidistrict remedy or on question

I, § 6, cl. 2, of Constitution, respondents had no standing to sue as citizens, since claimed nonobservance of Incompatibility Clause which they assert deprives citizens of faithful discharge of legislative duties of Reservist Members of Congress implicates only generalized interest of all citizens in constitutional governance and is thus merely an abstract injury rather than concrete injury that is essential to Art.

Constitution insofar as that clause requires a regular statement and account of public funds. United States v. Richardson, p. 166.
3. Federal taxpayer-Challenge to constitutionality of Central Intelligence Agency Act-Generalized grievance.--Respondent federal taxpayer's claim, in action challenging constitutionality of CIA Act, that without detailed information on CIA's expenditures he cannot properly follow legislative or executive action and thereby fulfill his obligations as a voter is a generalized grievance insufficient under Frothingham v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447, or Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83, to show that "he has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining a direct injury as the result" of such action. United States v. Richardson, p. 166.
4. Federal taxpayer-Challenge to constitutionality of Central Intelligence Agency Act-Lack of logical nexus.-Respondent's challenge that CIA Act violated Art. I, § 9, c. 7, of Constitution, not being addressed to taxing or spending power but to statutes regulating accounting and reporting procedures, provides no "logical nexus" between his status as "taxpayer" and asserted failure of Congress to require more detailed reports of expenditures of CIA. United States v. Richardson, p. 166.
5. Federal taxpayer-Generalized grievances.-Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83, which stressed need for meeting requirements of Art. III, did not "undermine the salutary principle . . . established by Frothingham [v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447] ... that a taxpayer may not 'employ a federal court as a forum in which to air his generalized grievances about the conduct of government or the allocation of power in the Federal System.'" United States v. Richardson, p. 166.
6. Federal taxpayers-Challenge to constitutionality of Reserve membership of Members of Congress-Logical nexus.-In class action by respondents (an association of present and former members of Armed Forces Reserve opposing United States involvement in Vietnam, and five association members) challenging Reserve membership of Members of Congress as violating Incompatibility Clause of Art. I, § 6, cl. 2, of Constitution, respondents lacked standing to sue as taxpayers, since they failed to establish required "logical nexus between the [taxpayer] status asserted and the claim sought to be adjudicated."

Amendment, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth (see Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U. S. 49, 70 (1973) (DouGLAs, J., dissenting)), would note jurisdiction and reverse the judgment. Reported below: 262 S. C. 178, 203 S. E. 2d 429.
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom MR. JUSTICE STEWART and MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL join, dissenting.
Appellant was convicted after a jury trial in the Fourth Judicial Circuit of South Carolina (Darlington County) on charges of feloniously exhibiting an obscene motion picture film in violation of the Code of Laws of South Carolina § 16-414.2 (Supp. 1973), which provides:
"It shall be unlawful for any person knowingly to send or cause to be sent, or to bring or cause to be brought into South Carolina for sale or distribution, or to prepare, publish, print, exhibit, distribute, or to offer to distribute in the State, or to have in his possession with intent to distribute, or to exhibit or to offer to distribute, any obscene matter."
As used in that section,
"(a) 'Obscene' means that to the average person, applying contemporary standards, the predominant appeal of the matter, taken as a whole, is to prurient interest among which is a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex or excretion, and which goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters. If it appears from the character of the material or the circumstances of its dissemination that the subject matter is to be distributed to minors under sixteen years of age, predominant appeal shall be judged with reference to such class of minors.
"(b) 'Matter' means any book, magazine, newspaper or other printed or written material or any pic-

ORDERS

911

BRENNAN, J., dissenting

ture, drawing, photograph, motion picture or other pictorial representation or any statute [sic] or other figure, or any recording, transcription or mechanical, chemical or electrical reproduction or any other article, equipment, machine or material.
"(c) 'Distribute'means to transfer possession of, whether with or without consideration.
"(d) The word 'knowingly' as used herein means having knowledge of the contents of the subject matter or failing after reasonable opportunity to exercise reasonable inspection which would have disclosed the character of such subject matter." S. C. Code Ann. § 16-414.1 (Supp. 1973).
The Supreme Court of South Carolina affirmed, 259 S. C. 185, 191 S.E. 2d 135 (1972). On appeal to this Court, the judgment of the Supreme Court of South Carolina was vacated and the case remanded for reconsideration in light of Miller v. California,413 U. S.15 (1973). 413 U. S.905. On remand, the Supreme Court of South Carolina again affirmed the conviction. 262 S. C. 178, 203 S.E. 2d 429.
It is my view that "at least in the absence of distribution to juveniles or obtrusive exposure to unconsenting adults, the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the State and Federal Governments from attempting wholly to suppress sexually oriented materials on the basis of their allegedly 'obscene' contents." Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U. S.49, 113 (1973) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting). Since it is clear that, when tested by that constitutional standard, the word "obscene" in §§ 16414.1 and 16-414.2 is constitutionally overbroad and therefore facially invalid, I disagree with the holding that the appeal does not present a substantial federal question, and therefore dissent from the Court's dismissal of the appeal.

OCTOBER TERM, 1973

BRENNAN, J., dissenting

418 U. S.

For the reasons stated in my dissent in Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, 47 (1973), and because the judgment of the Supreme Court of South Carolina was rendered
after Miller, I would reverse. In that circumstance, I have no occasion to consider whether the other questions presented plenary review. See Heller v. New York, 413 U. S. 483, 494 (1973) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting).
Moreover, on the basis of the Court's own holding in Jenkins v. Georgia,ante, p. 153, its dismissal is improper. As permitted by Rule 21 (1) of the Rules of this Court,
which provides that the record in a case need not be certified to this Court, the appellant did not certify the allegedly obscene materials involved in this case. It is plain, therefore, that the Court, which has not requested the certification of those materials, has failed to discharge its admitted responsibility under Jenkins independently to review those materials under the second and third parts of the Miller obscenity test. Nor can it be assumed that the court below performed such a review, since that responsibility was not made clear until Jenkins. Appellant has thus never been provided the independent judicial review to which the Court held him entitled in Jenkins. At a minimum, the Court should vacate the judgment below and remand for such a review.
Finally, it does not appear from the jurisdictional
statement and response that the obscenity of the disputed materials was adjudged by applying local community standards. Based on my dissent in Hamling v. United States, ante, p. 141, I believe that, consistent with the Due Process Clause, appellant must be given an opportunity to have his case decided on, and to introduce evidence relevant to, the legal standard upon which his conviction has ultimately come to depend. Thus, even on its own terms, the Court should vacate the judgment below and remand for a determination whether appellant

ORDERS

should be afforded a new trial under local' community standards.
No. 73-1508. MILLER V. CALIFORNIA. Appeal from App. Dept., Super. Ct. Cal., County of Orange, dismissed for want of substantial federal question. MR. JusTIcE DOUGLAS, being of the view that any state ban on obscenity is prohibited by the First Amendment, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth (see ParisAdult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U. S. 49, 70 (1973) (DOUGLAS, J., dissenting)), would note jurisdiction and reverse the judgment.
MR. JusTIcE BRENNAN, with whom MR. JusTIcE STEWART and MR. JusTIcE IMARSHALL join, dissenting.
Appellant was convicted in the Orange County, California, Superior Court of distributing obscene matter in violation of California Penal Code § 311.2 (1970), which provides in pertinent part as follows:
"Every person who knowingly sends or . . . possesses . . . with intent to distribute or to exhibit to others, . . . any obscene matter is guilty of a misdemeanor."

"Obscene matter" is defined in § 311 (a), which provides in pertinent part as follows:
"'Obscene matter' means matter, taken as a whole, the predominant appeal of which to the average person, applying contemporary standards, is to prurient interest, i. e., a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex, or excretion; and is matter which taken as a whole goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters; and is matter which taken as a whole is utterly without redeeming social importance."

OCTOBER TERM, 1973

418 U. S.

The Appellate Department of the Superior Court affirmed, and this Court vacated the judgment of that court and remanded the case for reconsideration in light of this Court's opinion. 413 U. S. 15 (1973). The Appellate Department again affirmed.
It is my view that "at least in the absence of distribution to juveniles or obtrusive exposure to unconsenting adults, the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the State and Federal Governments from attempting wholly to suppress sexually oriented materials on the basis of their allegedly 'obscene' contents." Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U. S. 49, 113 (1973) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting). Since it is clear that, when tested by that constitutional standard, the term "obscene matter" in § 311.2, as defined in § 311 (a) is unconstitutionally overbroad and therefore facially invalid, I disagree with the holding that the appeal does not present a substantial federal question, and therefore dissent from the Court's dismissal of the appeal.
For the reasons stated in my dissent in this case, 413
U. S., at 47, and because the second judgment of the Appellate Department of the California Superior Court was, of course, rendered thereafter, I would reverse. In that circumstance, I have no occasion to consider whether the other questions presented merit plenary review. See Heller v. New York, 413 U. S. 483, 494 (1973) (BinNNAN, J., dissenting).
Finally, it does not appear from the jurisdictional state-
ment and response that the obscenity of the disputed materials was adjudged by applying local community standards. Based on my dissent in Hamling v. United States, ante, p. 141, I believe that, consistent with the Due Process Clause, appellant must be given an opportunity to have his case decided on, and to introduce evidence relevant to, the legal standard upon which his conviction

United States, ante, p. 87, and Jenkins v. Georgia,ante, p. 153. MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, being of the view that any state ban on obscenity is prohibited by the First Amendment, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth (see Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U. S. 49, 70 (1973) (DOUGLAS, J., dissenting)), would grant certiorari and reverse the judgment. Reported below: 50 Ala. App. 735, 282 So. 2d 344.
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom MR. JUSTICE STEWART and MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL join, dissenting.
Petitioner was convicted in the Circuit Court of Montgomery County, Alabama, of selling allegedly obscene matter in violation of Title 14, § 374 (4), Code of Alabama (Supp. 1973), which provides in pertinent part as follows:
"Every person who, with knowledge of its contents, . . . sells ... any obscene printed or written matter... shall be guilty of a misdemeanor .... "
"Obscene," for purposes of § 374 (4), is defined in § 374 (3) as meaning "lewd, lascivious, filthy and pornographic and that to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, its dominant theme taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest." The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the conviction. 50 Ala. App. 735, 282 So. 2d 344.

It is my view that, "at least in the absence of distribution to juveniles or obtrusive exposure to unconsenting adults, the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the State and Federal Governments from attempting wholly to suppress sexually oriented materials on the basis of their allegedly 'obscene' contents." Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U. S. 49, 113 (1973) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting). It is clear that, tested by that constitutional standard, § 374 (4), as it incorporates the definition of "obscene" in § 374 (3), is constitutionally overbroad and therefore invalid on its face. For the reasons stated in my dissenting opinion in Miller v. California,413 U. S. 15, 47 (1973), I would therefore grant certiorari, vacate the judgment of the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals, and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with my ParisAdult Theatre I dissent.* In that circumstance, I have no occasion to consider at this time whether the other questions presented in the petition merit plenary review.

No. A-1265 (73-2014). MissoURi PORTLAND CEMENT Co. v. CARGILL, INC. C. A. 2d Cir. Motion of respondent to vacate stay heretofore entered by MR. JusTcIC DOUGLAS on July 12, 1974, granted. MR. JusTIcE BLACKMUN took no part in the consideration or decision of this motion. Reported below: 498 F. 2d 851.
MR. JUsTIFC DOUGLAS, dissenting.
Cargill, desirous of acquiring control of petitioner, made a cash offer for all of petitioner's common stock. Petitioner thereupon filed this suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to enjoin that tender offer, alleging that acquisition of control of petitioner would violate § 7 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 731, as amended, 15 U. S. C. § 18. That court issued the injunction stating in a detailed opinion its view that the acquisition of stock control by Cargill raises serious antitrust issues.
The sole question here is whether Cargill's attempts to take over Missouri Portland will be enjoined, pending the outcome of a trial on the merits of Missouri Portland's claim that a merger of these two companies would violate the antitrust laws. The District Court granted such an injunction, 375 F. Supp. 249, but the Court of Appeals reversed. 498 F. 2d 851. Missouri Portland sought and received a stay of the Court of Appeals' mandate, thus reinstituting the injunction issued by the District Court. Today the Court vacates that stay.
The Court treats the case as if we were in the sensitive First Amendment field where relatively minor restraints may have a "chilling" effect on an important constitu-

tional right. But as I read the Constitution and Bill of Rights, a corporation has no constitutional right to merge, consolidate, or acquire the assets of another company. The old Court in the days of "substantive due process" built an expansive corporate Bill of Rights by reading "liberty" in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment as including the "liberty" to exploit people, our resources, and our environment. The Court trifles with the antitrust laws when it vacates a stay that only requires Cargill to wait until there is a ruling on the merits before it swallows up Missouri Portland. What the Court does today is a shocking example of the disregard of law to please the management of huge conglomera.tes. Denial of a stay means a decision on the merits. For once the companies and their personnel are mixed, the momentum to complete the acquisition is almost irresistible. By careless neglect we actually decide that what appears to be a monstrous violation of the law may go on unremedied.

I
The Court of Appeals did not hold that the findings of the District Court were "clearly erroneous." The Court of Appeals considered the issue on the merits to be frivolous and only required Cargill to agree to hold the assets of Missouri Portland in a separate corporation or division so that it can be divested under any subsequent decree of the Court. But that misses the whole point, as I will make clear.

II
Missouri Portland is the Nation's 20th largest producer of Portland cement with 2% of the national capacity and 8% in the 11-state region it serves. The District Court defined the relevant markets here as four

ORDERS

metropolitan areas in which Missouri Portland ranks either first or second in market share. In all of these markets the top four firms have at least 88% of the market.'
Cargill is a huge, privately held conglomerate with headquarters in Minneapolis. In fiscal 1973 it had sales of $5.3 billion. Cargill specializes in commodities and thus has special skills in the transportation of heavy, bulk products and in the sale of fungible products. Cement is a heavy, bulky, fungible product, but Cargill is not involved in the cement industry.
Substantial antitrust issues are raised by the proposed takeover of Missouri Portland by Cargill. The District Court found that Cargill is the most likely potential entrant into the cement industry and concluded that a significant anticompetitive effect would result from Cargill's entry via a takeover of an already dominant firm rather than by de novo entry or by "toehold" acquisition. Furthermore, the District Court found that the addition of Cargill's huge financial resources to Missouri Portland's already substantial assets will raise significant barriers to entry of others in the relevant markets and will tend to increase the dominance of Missouri Portland in markets which are already heavily concentrated. Finally, the District Court noted that the challenged acquisition would eliminate a potential competitor from the fringe of the market, thereby possibly resulting in an additional anticompetitive effect.
The Court of Appeals disputed all of these conclusions by the District Court. Yet the very fact that disagreement exists between the two lower courts on these points indicates the likely existence of a substantial question. If the District Court's version of the facts is the correct

one, it seems that the takeover would violate the Clayton Act. See United States v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., 410 U. S. 526 (1973); Ford Motor Co. v. United States, 405 U. S. 562 (1972); FTC v. Procter & Gamble Co., 386 U. S. 568 (1967); United States v. Penn-Olin Chemical Co., 378 U. S. 158 (1964); United States v. El Paso Natural Gas Co., 376 U. S. 651 (1964).

III
The issues raised by the petition for certiorari present a substantial question that involves a conflict between the decisions below and another Court of Appeals. In Kennecott Copper Corp. v. FTC, 467 F. 2d 67 (CA10 1972), the court held that anticompetitive effect could occur even though the acquiring and acquired corporations did not produce related products but did have related skills.2 The court below was confronted with facts strikingly similar to those of Kennecott as regards the lack of related products but the presence of related skills. That court, however, candidly admitted that it was declining to follow the Kennecott decision. 498 F. 2d, at 860 n. 14. In our decision in United States v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., supra, at 537, we left open the extent to which potential anticompetitive effect will be considered determinative in "conglomerate mergers" such as this one where entry could have been de novo or via "toehold" ac-
2In addition, the opinion of the court below conflicts with
decisions of other Courts of Appeals on the significance of the acquiring corporation's "deep pocket." According to the court below, the facts that the acquiring corporation has great financial resources and that it intends to use these resources are not enough to show potential anticompetitive effect. But see General Foods Corp. v. FTC, 386 F. 2d 936 (CA3 1967); United States Steel Corp. v. FTC, 426 F. 2d 592 (CA6 1970); Ecko Products Co. v. FTC, 347 F. 2d 745 (CA7 1965); Kennecott Copper Co. v. FTC, 467 F. 2d 67 (CA10 1972).

quisition. Given the conflict between the Circuits on this matter, the present case presents a good vehicle in which
we should consider this problem.

IV
Cargill had acquired 18% of the common stock of Missouri Portland before the injunction issued. Now that the injunction has been lifted by the Court of Appeals and this Court, Cargill is free to acquire the controlling interest in Missouri Portland. That means that it can dictate what its subsidiary will do. We are foolhardy to assume that the litigation will then go on. Cargill in control of its subsidiary will make the subsidiary toe the line and be obedient to Cargill's wishes. The substantial antitrust issue apparent in the conflict between the Courts of Appeals will now not likely be resolved. The internal segregation of assets of the two companies is only an idle gesture.
If we fail to live under a rule of law and instead leave the field open to the uncontrolled machinations of conglomerates, Cargill will follow the infamous pattern of IT&T, uncontrolled and uncontrollable. Behind this motion to vacate the stay are very large questions of law and public policy. What is the place of antitrust law in the conglomerate field? Are conglomerates immune as some suggest? If not, what controls over them exist under present antitrust laws? These are questions that are substantial and pressing. The Circuits are in conflict; and the Court goes pellmell for an escape for this conglomerate from a real test under existing antitrust
law.
I repeat, there is no constitutional right to take over other companies. Cargill should be required to accept delay as one of the risks it incurred by seeking to gain control of so dominant a firm in the cement industry

Petitioners were enjoined by the Circuit Court for Prince Georges County, Maryland, from selling a group of allegedly obscene books, on the authority of Art. 27, §§ 418 and 418A, of the Annotated Code of Maryland. Section 418A grants jurisdiction to the circuit courts to enjoin the sale or distribution of any publication which is "obscene" within the meaning of § 418. Section 418

BRENNAN, J., dissenting

provides in pertinent part as follows: "Every person who knowingly sends or causes to be sent... into this State... or . . . distributes . . . any obscene matter is guilty of a misdemeanor." As respondent concedes, the Maryland courts have defined the term "obscenity" in this section by adopting the test set forth in Roth v. United States, 354 U. S. 476 (1957). See Wagonheim v. Maryland State Board of Censors, 255 Md. 297, 304-305, 258 A. 2d 240, 243-244 (1969). The Court of Appeals
affirmed, 263 Md. 76, 282 A. 2d 126, and this Court granted certiorari, vacated the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remanded the case for reconsideration in light of Miller v. California,413 U. S. 15 (1973). 413 U. S. 911. That court again affirmed in an unreported
opinion. It is my view that "at least in the absence of distribu-

ParisAdult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U. S. 49, 113 (1973) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting). It is clear that, tested by that constitutional standard, § 418A, as it incorporates the term "obscene" in § 418, is constitutionally overbroad and therefore invalid on its face.

That section provides, in relevant part:
"(a) A person commits the offense of distributing obscene materials when he sells, lends, rents, leases, gives, advertises, publishes, exhibits or otherwise disseminates to any person any obscene material of any description, knowing the obscene nature thereof, or who offers to do so, or who possesses such material with the intent so to do ....
"(b) Material is obscene if considered as a whole, applying community standards, its predominant appeal is to prurient interest, that is, a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex or excretion, and utterly without redeeming social value and if, in addition, it goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in describing or representing such matters. ...

"(d) A person convicted of distributing obscene material shall for the first offense be punished as for a misdemeanor, and for any subsequent offense shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than one nor more than five years, or by a fine not to exceed $5,000, or both."

OCTOBER TERM, 1973

Opinion of WirrE, J.

418 U. S.

Brother BRENNAN'S complaints are wide of the mark.
Obscenity cases, like others, are not immune from the
standards generally governing the exercise of our appellate jurisdiction. The Court has never indicated that plenary review is mandatory in every case dealing with the issue of obscenity.
In five of these cases,1 the issue whether the materials involved are obscene was not presented to this Court and the publications themselves were not lodged here. Rule 23 (1) (c) of this Court's Rules provides that "[o]nly the questions set forth in the petition or fairly comprised therein will be considered by the court." Rule 15 (1) (c) with respect to appeals is to the identical effect. I suggest that we are entitled to follow our own Rules. See R. Stern & E. Gressman, Supreme Court Practice § 6.37, pp. 297-299 (4th ed. 1969).
In six other cases,2 the issue of obscenity vel non is among the questions presented here, but the materials themselves have not been filed with Wi# Court. While our Rules permit parties to dispense with filing the entire record at the petition for certiorari stage, a petitioner is completely free at that time to file all or any part of the record he deems necessary or desirable to present clearly the issues he wants reviewed. Indeed, our Rule 23 (4) states that "[tihe failure of a petitioner to present with accuracy, brevity, and clearness whatever is essential to a ready and adequate understanding of the points requiring consideration will be a sufficient reason for denying his petition." Had the petitioner in any of
1 Carlson v. United States, supra; Village Books, Inc. v. Marshall,

Opinion of WHrrE, J.

these cases desired that serious attention be given to the
materials themselves, he could have filed them here.
Moreover, in each instance either the Court of Appeals or the state appellate court expressly addressed the issue of obscenity and found the materials obscene under proper standards. Under these circumstances, denying
certiorari is wholly consistent with our practice. Finally, I join in denying petitions for certiorari in
this case and two other cases, Buckley v. New York, supra, and Sians v. United States, supra. In Buckley, the materials in question have been lodged with the Court, and the issue of their obscenity is raised in the petition for certiorari. They were examined and described by the Court of Appeals for the State of New York and were held to be obscene under both Miller and pre-Mil/er standards. Examination of the materials has not persuaded me that certiorari should be granted. The same is true of Sians. The materials, an unremitting series of explicit photographs of a wide spectrum of sexual conduct, including homosexual acts, anal intercourse, fellatio, cunnilingius, and group orgies, were held obscene under any standard by the Court of Appeals. I would not review that judgment.
In J-R Distributors,Inc., the case in which this opinion is filed, the issue of the obscenity of the materials involved was raised in the petition for certiorari, and part, but not all, of them was lodged with this Court. I join in denying the petition for certiorari. Although some of the materials have not been filed here and are therefore not before us, the Washington Supreme Court found all of them obscene under both Roth and Miller standards. As for the materials on file, it is sufficiently clear to me that they fall within the category of hard-core pornography unprotected by the First Amendment that plenary review is not required. One of the publications involved is Sex Between Humans and Animals. MR.

JUSTICE BRENNAN would apparently hold that the First Amendment prohibits government from denying consenting adults access to such material, but I do not construe the First Amendment as preventing the States from prohibiting the distribution of a publication whose dominant theme is represented by repeated photographs of men and women performing sex acts with a variety of animals.

MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom MR. JUSTICE STEWART and MR. JusTICE MARSiHALL join, dissenting.
Petitioners were convicted for violations of Revised Code of Washington § 9.68.010 (Supp. 1972), which provides:
"Every person who"(1) Having knowledge of the contents thereof shall exhibit, sell, distribute, display for sale or distribution, or having knowledge of the contents thereof shall have in his possession with the intent to sell or distribute any book, magazine, pamphlet, comic book, newspaper, writing, photograph, motion picture film, phonograph record, tape or wire recording, picture, drawing, figure, image, or any object or thing which is obscene; or "(2) Having knowledge of the contents thereof shall cause to be performed or exhibited, or shall engage in the performance or exhibition of any show, act, play, dance or motion picture which is obscene; "Shall be guilty of a gross misdemeanor. "The provisions of this section shall not apply to acts done in the scope of his employment by a motion picture operator or projectionist employed by the owner or manager of a theatre or other place for the showing of motion pictures, unless the motion picture operator or projectionist has a financial in-

terest in such theatre or place wherein he is so employed or unless he caused to be performed or exhibited such performance or motion picture without the knowledge and consent of the manager or owner
of the theatre or other place of showing."
The Supreme Court of Washington affirmed the convic-
tions, 82 Wash. 2d 584, 512 P. 2d 1049, and subsequently denied a petition for rehearing.
It is my view that "at least in the absence of distribu-
tion to juveniles or obtrusive exposure to unconsenting adults, the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the State and Federal Governments from attempting wholly to suppress sexually oriented materials on the basis of their allegedly 'obscene' contents." Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U. S.49, 113 (1973) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting). It is clear that, tested by that constitutional standard, § 9.68.010 is constitutionally overbroad and therefore invalid on its face. For the reasons stated in my dissent in Miller v. California,413 U. S. 15, 47 (1973), I would therefore grant certiorari, and, since the judgment of the Washington Supreme Court was rendered after Miller, reverse.1 In that circumstance, I have no occasion to consider whether the other questions presented merit plenary review. See Hellerv. New York, 413 U. S.483, 494 (1973) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting).
Moreover, on the basis of the Court's own holding in Jenkins v. Georgia,ante, p. 153, its denial of certiorari is improper. As permitted by Rule 21 (1) of the Rules of this Court, which provides that the record in a case need not be certified to this Court, certain of these petitioners did not certify the allegedly obscene materials involved

1Although four of us would grant certiorari and reverse the judgment, the Justices who join this opinion do not insist that the case be decided on the merits.

in this case.' It is plain, therefore, that the Court, which has not requested the certification of those materials, has failed to discharge its admitted responsibility under Jenkins independently to review those materials under the second and third parts of the Miller obscenity test. Nor can it be assumed that the court below performed such a review, since that responsibility was not made clear until Jenkins. Those petitioners have thus never been provided the independent judicial review to which the Court held them entitled in Jenkins. At a minimum, the Court should vacate the judgment below and remand for such a review.
No. 73-908. COTE V. UNITED STATES. C. A. 5th Cir. Certiorari denied. MR. JUsTIcE DOUGLAS, being of the view that any federal ban on obscenity is prohibited by the First Amendment (see United States v. 12 200-ft. Reels of Film, 413 U. S. 123, 130 (1973) (DouGLAs, J., dissenting)), would grant certiorari and reverse the judgment. Reported below: 470 F. 2d 755.
No. 73-1241. ADULT FILM ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA ET AL. V. LUCAS, U. S. DISTRICT JUDGE (SAXBE, ATTORNEY
GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES, ET AL., REAL PARTIES
IN INTEREST). C. A. 9th Cir. Certiorari denied. MR. JusTIcE DOUGLAS, being of the view that any federal ban on obscenity is prohibited by the First Amendment (see United States v. 12 200-ft Reels of Film, 413 U. S. 123, 130 (1973) (DOUGLAS, J., dissenting)), would grant certiorari and reverse the judgment below.

OPINION OF INDIVIDUAL JUSTICE IN CHAMBERS
IN RE GRAND JURY PROCEEDINGS (LEWIS, APPLICANT)
ON APPLICATION FOR STAY OF EXECUTION AND/OR BAIL PENDING APPEAL
No. A-1268. Decided July 4, 1974
Applicant newsman, with no criminal record, who had given FBI copies of tapes and documents delivered to him by an underground group but whoim District Court held in contempt for refusing to deliver originals, is released on personal recognizance pending Court of Appeals' decision on the merits.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, Circuit Justice. Applicant asks for release on bail or a stay of the execution of the District Court's order committing him for contempt pending decision of his case on the merits by the Court of Appeals. He had given the FBI copies of certain tapes and documents delivered to him by an underground group but refused to deliver the originals. So far as I am advised, he was held in contempt for that refusal. Substantial First Amendment claims are raised under the majority ruling in Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U. S. 665, as evident from Gibson v. FloridaLegislative Investigation Committee, 372 U. S. 539, 546. I indicate no view on the merits. But since the applicant is a newsman entitled to all First Amendment protections and has no criminal record, I have entered an order releasing him on his personal recognizance, pending decision of his appeal by the Court of Appeals.
