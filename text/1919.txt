Counsel for Parties.

infringers. Palpably this is a mere license, not sufficient to sustain a suit for infringement.
Several minor questions, including some of practice, are argued in the brief for appellant, but the opinion of the Court of Claims deals with them thoroughly and
satisfactorily and its judgment is A firmed.

PIEDMONT POWER & LIGHT COMPANY v. TOWN
OF GRAHAM ET AL.
PASCHALL ET AL. v.TOWN OF GRAHAM ET AL.
APPEALS FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA.
Nos. 684, 685. Motion to dismiss or affirm or place on the summary docket submitted April 19, 1920.-Decided May 17, 1920.
The proposition that a municipality, having granted to a company the right to use the streets for distributing electricity, would impair the rights of the grantee.and deprive it of property without due process if it granted a like right to a rival company, is frivolous if the first grant is plainly non-exclusive; and an appeal from the District Court based on such claim must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. P. 194.
Appeals dismissed.
THE cases are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Clyde R. Hoey, Mr. Charles W. Tillett, Mr. William P. Bynum, Mr. James S. Cook, Mr. Jacob A. Long and Mr. Sidney S. Alderman, for appellees, on the briefs in support of the motion.
Mr. James H. Bridgers, for appellants, on the briefs in opposition to the motion.

OCTOBER TERM, 1919.

Opinion of the Court.

253 1. S.

Memorandum opinion by direction of the' court, by MFIR. JUSTICE CLARKE.

These are appeals direct from decrees of the District Court sustaining motions to dismiss complaints for the reason that they did not state facts sufficient to constitute a valid cause of action in equity. The cases involve the same facts differently stated by different complainants. The asserted warrant for the appeals is that action taken by the officials of the Town of Graham, North Carolina, if allowed to become effective, would result in violation of appellants' contract with that town and in depriving them of their property without due process of law, in violation of the Constitution of the United States.
Since the bill in No. 684 contains all of the elements of strength which the bill in No. 685 contains and lacks some of its elements of weakness, the disposition of the former will rule the latter.
In No. 684 the appellant, a corporation, averring that it is the owner of a franchise to use the streets of the Town of Craham for the distribution 'of electric current, prays that the officials of the town be restrained from certifying as lawfully passed an ordinance granting a like franchise to the defendant, the Mutual Power & Light Company,
and that the company be enjoined from using the streets for such purpose.
The grant to the appellant is set out in full in the bill
and plainly it is not one of exclusive rights in the streets. The attempt to derive an exclusive grant from the declaration, in the paragraph of the ordinance relating to the trimming of trees, that "said Town of Graham hereby warrants that it will, by its proper authorities, provide for the full and free use of its streets, lanes," etc., is fatuous and futile. Grants of rights and privileges by a State or municipality are strictly construed and whatever is not unequivocally granted is withheld,-nothing passes

The grant to appellant. not being an exclusive one, the contention that competition in business, likely to result from a similar grant to another company, would be a violation of appellant's contract, or a taking of its property in violation of the Constitution of the United States is so plainly frivolous that the motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction, filed irr each case, must be sustained.

UNITED STATES v. MACMILLAN ET AL.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT.
No. 167. SubmittedJanuary 23, 1920.-IDecided June 1,1920.
The excepti6nal legislation under which the salary of the clerk of the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois was for a time appropriated for by Congress, leaving, however, the expenses of his office to be defrayed as in other cases out of the fees and emoluments did not operate to convert such fees and emoluments when collected into public moneys of the United States.

Moneys received by a clerk of a District Court as interest upon a verage daily balances of bank deposits made up of fees and emoluments earned by the clerk, or made of moneys deposited with him by litigants to meet future costs, etc., under rule of court, are not public moneys of the United States, nor emoluments for which he must account to the Government.

217.

-

Syllabus.

140 U. S. 529, reversing s. c. 146 Massachusetts, 545, judicial action is supposed to be necessary for the final detrmination of the right. But we cannot consider that question or the other arguments upon the merits of the case, because, Mr. McAdoo having resigned the office of Secretary of the Treasury, his successor was not substituted within twelve months; which is the limit for such substitution fixed by the Act of February 8, 1899, c. 121, 30 Stat. 822. It is said that the Code of the District of Columbia, §.1278, allows the petitioner to recover damages in the same proceeding and that the petition should be retained to charge Mr. McAdoo personally. But apart from other questions the damages are only incident to the allowance of the writ of mandamus, and as that cannot be allowed the whole proceeding is at an end. See Pullman Co. v. Knott, .243 U. S. 447, 451; Pullman Co. v. Croom, 231 U. S. 571, 577.

Memorandum opinion by direction of the court, by MR. JUSTICE DAY.

The Consolidated Gas Company of New York brought suit to enjoin the enforcement of the New York eightycent gas law. The jurisdiction was invoked solely upon the ground that the rate was confiscatory and hence violated constitutional rights of the company. The City of Hew York applied for leave to intervene as a party defendant in the action. The District Judge denied the petition for _'terventiop -tating that the Public Service Commission, the Attorney General and the District Attorney properly ·re--esented private consumers; that the City had no-interest in the litigation as a consumer; was not the !-vernmental body which had fixed the rate, and was not charged with the duty of enforcing it. From the order denying the application to intervene the City of New York prosecuted an appeal to the Circuit Court of

Appeals, and the latter court affirmed- the order of the District Court.
The application was addressed to the discretion of the District Court, and the order appealed from was not of that final character which furnished the basis for appeal. Ex parte Cutting, 94 U. S. 14, 22; Credits Commutation Co. v. United States, 177 U. S. 311, 315; Ex parte Leaf Tobacco Board of Trade, 222 U. S. 578, 581. As the jurisdiction of the District Court was based upon constitutional grounds only, the case was not appealable to the Circuit Court of Appeals. But, an appeal having been taken and a final order made in the Circuit Court of Appeals, we have jurisdiction to review the question of jurisdiction of that court. (Judicial Code, § 241.)

FIDELITY TITLE CO. v. DUBOIS ELEC. CO. 213

212.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.

This is an action begun by Pancoast, to recover for personal injuries, and continued after his death by the petitioner as ancillary administrator. At a former trial the plaintiff had a verdict but it was set aside and a new trial ordered by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 238 Fed. Rep. 129, 132. 151 C. C. A. 205. At the new trial the plaintiff again got a verdict and judgment, but the Circuit Court of Appeals set them aside,. this time simply reversing the judgment without ordering 4 new trial. 253 Fed. Rep. 987. An opportunity was allowed to that Court to correct the error and as it was not corrected the present writ of certiorari was granted. 249 U. S. 606, 597. Of course if the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals was right on the merits a new trial should have been ordered. Slocum v. New York Life Insurance Co., 228 U. S. 364. Myers v. PittsburghCoal Co., 233 U. S. 184, 189. But as it has been necessary to direct the record to be certified up, it is necessary also to consider the merits of the case and to determine whether the Circuit Court of Appeals was right with regard to them.
Nothing turns upon the form of the pleadings. The evidence for the plaintiff was in conflict with that for the defendant upon important points, but we shall state the case as the jury might have found it to be if they believed the plaintiff's evidence, as the verdict shows they did.-A member of a political party requested the defendant to suspend a political banner, which he furnished, across one of the principal streets in the borough of Dubois, between the Commercial Hotel and the Deposit National Bank. He asked the defendant to put it up, take it down after the election and attend to it for him, saying that he did not want to have anything to do with it. The defendant put up the banner, at first suspending it by a

OCTOBER TERM, 1919.

253 U. S.

rope, but the rope breaking, substituted for it a wire cable of the defendant's, and, the plaintiff .says, did so without further orders. This cable was fastened on the hotel side by taking two turns round a chimney and clamping the end. The chimney stood thirty-one inches from the edge of, the* cornice over the street, was twenty-one inches square at the base, and hada tin flashing from the roof inserted between the courses of brick two or three courses above the roof. According to the plaintiff's evidence the cable was attached above the flashing. The lower corners of the banner were attached to the buildings on their respective sides. Five days after the banner was suspended the man who employed the defendant caused it to string electric lights along the wire, not otherwise interfering with the work. 'The same day in. the afternoon, the weather being stormy, the banner dragged the chimney over and a brick struck Pancoast on the head, making a comminuted 'fracture of the skull. The defendant put up the banner a third time after this fall, again, the plaintiff says, without further direction, and when the election was over took it down.
If thesewere-the facts, and, except with regard to the extent or the defendant's control, they could not be disputed, manifestly the verdict was warranted. It did not leave the defendant free from any duty to Pancoast and the other travellers in the street that they had no contract with it. An act of this kind that reasonable care would have shown to endanger life, might have made the actor guilty of manslaughter, if not, in an extreme case, of murder. Rigmaidon's Case, Lewin, 180. See Nash v. United States, 229 U. S. 373, 377. Commonwealth v. Pierce, 138 Massachusetts, 165, 178. The same considerations apply to civil liability for personal injuries from similar causes that would have been avoided by reasonable care. See Gray v. Boston Gas Light Co., 114 Massachusetts, 149. A man is not free to introduce a danger

into public places even if he be under no contract with the persons subjected to the risk.
It hardly is denied that there was evidence of negligence, but it was held by the Circuit Court of Appeals that the defendant's relation to the work ceased when the banner was hung, that it had no further control over it and was not liable for what happened thereafter. Of course it is true that when the presence or absence of danger depends upon the subsequent conduct of the person to whom control is surrendered, the previous possessor may be exonerated when the control is changed. Curtin v. Somerset, 140 Pa. St. 70. Murphey v. Caralli, 3 Hurlst. & Colt. 462. Thornton v. Dow, 60 Washington, 622. Glynn v. Central R. R. Co., 175 Massachusetts, 510. Clifford v. Atlantic Cotton Mills, 146 Massachusetts, 47, 48. But how far this principle will be carried may be uncertain, Union Stock Yards Co. v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co., 196 U. S. 217, 223, and when as here the danger had been called fully into existence by the defendant it could not escape liability for the result of conditions that it alone knew, had created and had arranged to have continue, by stepping out of the conrol a few days before the event came to 'pass. Harrisv. James, 45 L. J., Q. B. 545. Todd v. Flight, 9 C. B. N. S. 377. Swords v. Edgar, 59 N. Y. 28. Godley v. Hagerty, 20 Pa. St. 387. Joyce v. Martin, 15 R. I. 558. Jackman v. Arlington Mills, 137 Massachusetts, 277, 283. Dalay v. Savage, 145 Massachusetts, 38, 41. Clifford v. Atlantic Cotton Mills, 146 Massachusetts, 47, 49.
But it could not be said as matter of law that the defendant had stepped out of control. The facts in their legal aspect probably were somewhat hazy. Presumably the tenant of the hotel simply permitted what was done and had no other relation to it than such as might be imposed upon him by the law. Evidently the defendant handled the banner when it wanted to, and no one else

touched it. The defendant's employer if he told the truth not only did not intermeddle but might be found to have expressly required the defendant to take the responsibility. All the probabilities are that such control as there was remained with the defendant. The defendant got more thanit was entitled to when the jury were instructed that even if the fall was due to negligence in putting up the banner, the defendant would not be liable unless by arrangement it had assumed a continuing duty to maintain the banner in a safe condition. The testimony on the two sides was contrasted and it was left to the jury to say which they would believe..
As we have implied, we regard it as too plain for discussion that the plaintiff's evidence if believed warranted a finding that the defendant undertook the care of the banner while it was up. An effort is made to establish an error in allowing an amendment to the declaration after the statute of limitations had run. The declaration originally alleged negligence in the use of the chimney and that the fall was due to the use of the chimney as alleged. The amendment alleged also that defendant maintained the banner. If any objection is open it is enough to say that the original declaration was sufficient and that the amendment plainly left the cause of action unchanged.
Judgment reversed. Judgment of the District Court affirmed.

OCTOBER TERM, 1919.

Opinion of the Court.

253 U. S.

MR. JUSTICE McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the court.

Acting upon a complaint charging plaintiff in error, a water company, with demanding unreasonable rates, the Public Service Commission of Pennsylvania instituted an investigation and took evidence. It found the fair value of the company's property to be $924,744 and ordered establishment of a new and lower schedule which would yield seven per centum thereon over and above operating
expenses and depreciation. Claiming the Commission's valuation was much too low
and that the order would deprive it of a reasonable return. and thereby confiscate its property, the company appealed to the Superior Court. The latter reviewed the certified record, appraised the property at $1,324,621.80, reversed the order and remanded the proceeding with directions to authorize rates sufficient to yield seven per centum of such sum.
The Supreme Court of the State reversed the decree and reinstated the order saying-" The appeal [to the Superior Court] presented for determination the question whether the order appealed from was reasonable and in conformity with law, and in this inquiry was involved the question of the fair value, for rate making purposes, of the property of appellant, and the:amount of revenue which appellant was entitled to collect. In its decision upon the appeal, the Superior Court differed from the commission as to the proper valuation to be placed upon several items going to make up the fair value of the property of the water company for rate making purposes." I+considered those items and held that as there was competent evidence tending to sustain the Commission's conclusion and no abuse of discretion appeared, the Superior Court should not have interfered therewith. "A careful examination of the voluminous record in this case has led us to the

OHIO VALLEY CO. v. BEN AVON BOROUGH. 289

287.

Opinion of the Court.

conclusion that in the items wherein the Superior Court differed from the commission upon the question of values, there was merely the substitution of the former's judgment for that of the commission, in determining that the order of the latter was unreasonable."
Looking at the entire opinion we are compelled to conclude that the Supreme Court interpreted the statute as withholding from the courts power to determine the question of confiscation according to their own independent judgment when the action of the Commission comes to be considered on appeal.
The order here involved prescribed a complete schedule of maximum future rates and was legislative in character. Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., 211 U. S. 210; Lake Erie & Western R. R. Co. v. State Public Utilities Commission, 249 U. S.422, 424 In all such cases, if the owner claims confiscation of his property will result, the State must provide a fair opportunity for submitting that issue to a judicil tribunal for determination upon its own independent judgment as to both law and facts; otherwise the order is void because in conflict with the due, process clause, Fourteenth Amendment. MissouriPacific
Ry. Co. v. Tucker, 230 U. S. 340, 347; Wadley Southern Ry. Co. v. Georgia, 235 U. S. 651, 660, 661; Missouri v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co., 241 U. S. 533, 538; Oklahoma Operating Co. v. Love, 252 U. S..331.
Here the insistence is that the Public Service Company Law as "construed and applied by the Supreme Court has deprived plaintiff in error of the right to be so heard; and this is true if the appeal therein specifically provided is the only clearly authorized proceeding where the Commission's order may be challenged because confiscatory. Thus far plaintiff in error has not succeeded in obtaining the review for which the Fourteenth Amendment requires the State
to provide.

OCTOBER TERM, 1919.

Opinion of the !Court.

253 U. S.

Article VI, Public, Service Company Law of Pennsylvania-
"Section 31. No injunction shall issue modifying, suspending, staying, or annulling any order of the commission, or of a commissioner, except upon notice to the commission and after cause shown upon a hearing. The court of Common Pleas of :Dauphin County is hereby clothed with exclusive jurisdiction throughout the Commonwealth of all. proceedings for such injunctions, subject
to an appeal to the Supreme Court as aforesaid. Whenever the commission shall make any rule, regulation, finding, determination, or order under the provisions of this act the same shall be and remain conclusive upon all parties affected thereby, unless set aside, annulled, or modified in an appeal or proceeding taken as provided in this act."
It is argued that this section makes adequate provision for testing judicially any order by the Commission when alleged to be confiscatory, and that plaintiff in error has failed to take advantage of the opportunity so
provided.
The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has not ruled upon effect or meaning of § 31, or expressed any view concering it. So far as counsel have been able to discover, no relief against an order alleged to be confiscatory has
been sought under this section, although much litigation has arisen under the act. It is part of the article entitled- 'Practice and Procedure before -the Commission and upon Appeal." Certain opinions by the Supreme Couirt seem to indicate that all objections to the Commission's orders must be determined upon appeal-St. Clair Borough v. Tamaqua & Pottsville Electric Ry. Co., 259 Pa. St. 462; Pittsburgh Railways Co. v. Pittsburgh, 260 Pa. St. 424-but they do not definitely decide the
point. Taking into consideration the whole act, statements by

OHIO VALLEY CO. v. BEN AVON BOROUGH. 291

287.

Opinion of the Court.

the state Supreme Court concerning the general plan of regulation, and admitted local practice, we are unable to say that § 31' offered an opportunity to test the order do clear and definite that plaintiff in error was obliged to proceed thereunder or suffer loss of rights guaranteed by the Federal Constitution. On the contrary, after specifying that within thirty days an appeal may be taken to the Superior Court (§.17) the act provides (§ 22): "At the hearing of the appeal the said court shall, upon the record. certified to it by the commission, determine whether or not the order appealed from is reasonable and in confornm ity with law." But for the opinion of the Supreme Court in the'present cause, this would seem to empower the Superior Court judicially to hear and determine all objections to an order on appeal and io make its jurisdiction in respect thereto exclusive. Of this the latter court apparently entertained no doubt; and certainly counsel did not, fatally err by adopting that view, whatever meaning finally may be attributed to § 31.
Without doubt the duties of the courts upon appeals under the act are judicial in character-not legislative,: as in Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., supra. This is not disputed; but their jurisdictibn, as ruled by the Supreme
Court, stopped short of what must be plainly entrusted to some court in order that there may be due process of law.
Plaintiff in error has not had proper opportunity for an adequate judicial hearing as to confiscation; and unless such an opportunity is now available, and can be definitely indicated by the court below in the exercise of its power finally to construe laws of the State (including of course § 31), the challenged order is invalid.
The judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania must be reversed and the cause remanded there with instructions to take further action, not inconsistent with this opinion.
Reversed.

253 U. S.

MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS, dissenting.

The Public Service Commission of Pennsylvania, acting
upon complaint of Ben Avon Borough and others, found, after due notice and hearing, that increased rates adopted by the Ohio Valley Water Company were unreasonable; and it prescribed a schedule of lower. rates which it estimated would yield seven per cent. net upon the value of the property used and useful in the service. The company appealed to the Superior Court, contending that the property -had been undervalued and that the rates were, therefore, confiscatory in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. That court, passing upon the weight of the evidence introduced before the .Commission, found that larger amounts should have been allowed for several items which entered into the valuation, reversed the order on that ground, and directed the Commissi6n to reform its valuation accordingly and upon such revised valuation to fiX a schedule of rates which would yield the net return which it had found to be fair. From the decision of the Superior Court the Commission appealed to the Supreme Court of the State, contending that the Superior Court had in passing upon the weight of the evidence exceeded its jurisdiction. The Supreme Court sustained this contention; and holding, upon a careful review of the evidence and of the opinions below, that the Commission had been justified in its findings by "ample testimony" or "competent evidence" and -that they were not unreasonable, reversed the decree of the Superior Court and reinstated the order of the Commission. 260 Pa. St. 289. The case comes here on writ of error under §237 of the Judicial Code, as amended, the company claiming that its rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment have been violated: (1) because the Public Service Company Law, as construed by the Supreme Court of the State, denies the opportunity of a judicial review of the Commission's

OHIO VALLEY CO. v. BEN AVON BOROUGH. 293

287.

BRANDEIS, HOLMES and CLARKE, JJ., dissenting.

order; and (2) that the order, which was reinstated by the Supreme Court, confiscates its property.
First: The Commission's order, although entered in a proceeding commenced upon due notice, conducted according to judicial practice and participated in throughout by the company, was a legislative order; and, being such, the company was entitled to a judicial review. Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., 211 U. S. 210, 228. The method of review invoked by the company under specific provisions of the statute was this: A stenographic report is made of all the evidence introduced before the Commission. On a record consisting of such evidence, the opinion and the orders, the case is appealed to the Superior Court, which is given power, if it*finds that 'the order appealed from "is unreasonable or based upon incompetent evidence materially affecting the determination or order of the commission, or is otherwise not in conformity with law" either to reverse the order or to remand the record to the Commission with direction to reconsider the matter and make such order as shall be reasonable and in conformity with law. No additional evidence may be introduced in the Superior Court;.but it may remand the case to the Commission with directions to hear newly discovered evidence and upon the record thus supple:mented to enter such order as may be reasonable and in conformity with law. From such new order a like appeal lies to that court. Act of July 26, 1913, No. 854, §§ 21-25, P. L.. 1913, pp. 1427, 1428; Act of July 3, 1915, No. 345, P. L. 1915, p. 779. The Supreme Court construed this act as denying to the Superior Court the power to pass upon the weight of evidence; and the company contehds that for this reason the review had does not satisfy the constitutional requirements of a judicial review.'
In Napa Valley Electric Co. v. Railroad Commission, 251 U. S. 366, this court had before it in § 67 of the Public Utilities Act of California a procedure substantially similar to that provided by §§ 21-25 of the

OCTOBER TERM, 1919.
BRANDEIS, HOLMEs and CLARKE, JJ., dissenting. 253 U. S.
Whether the appeal to the Superior Court fails for the reason assigned, or for some other reason, to satisfy the constitutional requirements of a judicial review we need not determine; because the statute left open to the company, besides this limited review, the right to resort in the state courts, as well as in the federal court, to another and unrestricted remedy; the one commonly pursued when challenging the validity of a legislative order of this nature, namely, a suit in equity to enjoin its enforcement., ',See Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v,Garrett, 231 U. S. 298, 311; Wadley Southern Ry. Co. v. Georgia, 235 U. S. 651, 661. For § 31 (P. L. 1913, p. 1429) provides:
"No injunction shall issue modifying, 'suspending, staying, or annulling any order of the commission, or of a commissioner, except upon notice to the commission and after cause shown upon a hearing. The court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County is hereby clothed with exclusive jurisdiction throughout the Commonwealth of all'proceedings for such injunctions, subject to an appeal to the -Supreme Court as aforesaid. Whenever the commission shall make any rule, regulation, finding, determination, or order under the provisions of this act the same shall be and remain conclusive upon all parties affected thereby, unless set aside, annulled, or modified in an appeal or proceeding taken as provided in this act."
Resort to suit for injunction is made easy in rate controversies like the present by § 41, p. 1432, in which it is provided that the penalties for failure to obey the Commission's orders imposed by §§ 35, 36 and 39, pp. 1430, 1431, shall not apply to an order declaring a rate unreasonable, if the tariff of rates actually charged is filed
Pennsylvania Act set forth above. The court strongly intimated, if it did not decide, that under the provisions of the act the mere denial of a petition to the Supreme Court of the State for a writ of certiorari amounted to an adequate judicial determination of the petitioner's rights.

with the Commission. The appeal provided for in §§ 22-25
was under the original act also to the Court of Common
Pleas, but was changed to the Superior Court by the Act
of July 3, 1915. No decisions of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania
construing § 31 of this act have been brought to our
attention. The company contends, however, that the construction here suggested has been inferentially made untenable by dicta in St. Clair Borough v. Tamaqua & Pottsville. Electric Ry. Co., 259 Pa. St. 462; Pittsburgh Railways Co. v. Pittsburgh, 260 Pa. St. 424; Klein-Logan Co. v. Duquesne Light Co., 261 Pa. St. 526. But the lan-
guage relied upon was in each instance used by the court in making the point, not that the sole method of review was by appeal as distinguished from a bill in equity, but that the function of the courts was to review only after the Commission had in the first instance passed upon the case.
Where a State offers a litigant the choice of two methods of judicial review, of which one is both appropriate and unxestricted, the mere fact that the other which the litigant elects is limited, does not amount to a denial of the constitutional right to a judicial review. The alternative or additional remedy in the present case was in effect an appeal on the law applicable to facts found below. It is in substantial accord with the practice pursued in other appellate courts and approved in New York & Queens Gas Co. v. McCall, 245 U. S. 345. It is true, however, that an additional ,or alternative remedy may deny the constitutional right to due process of law because of its nature or the course of the proceeding. See Iowa Central Ry. Co. v. Iowa, 160 U. S.389. And it is the contention of the plaintiff that because the Supreme Court did not weigh the evidence but reinstated the order 'of the Commission on account of there being substantial evidence to support it, the procedure was not a*judicial review and denied it due process of law. The defendants, on the other hand,

insist that the action of the Supreme Court, in reinstating the order, found not merely that there was substantial evidence, but, upon a full review, that there was ample evidence to support the findings, and that the order was reasonable. They conten4 that the course pursued by the Supreme Court in making such review was that customarily followed in Pennsylvinia, both by appellate courts on appeals from chancellors and by trial courts on exceptions to reports of auditors, masters or referees, Barnes's Estate, 221 Pa. St. 399; and they point out that the same method was pursued on appeal to the Supreme Court prior to the enactment of the Public Service Company Law, at a time when proceedings by consumers to secure reduction of water rates alleged to be unreasonably high were brought in the Court of Common Pleas, subject to appeal to the Supreme Court. Turtle Creek Borough v. Pennsylvania Water Co., 243 Pa. St. 401.
The contention of neither party is in my opinion wholly correct. Both overlook the nature of the question of law which was under review by the Supreme Court. It is true that there was no statutory limitation upon the scope of its review; but it does not follow either that the Supreme Court weighed the evidence and found that the preponderance supported the findings, or that because it failed to weigh the evidence there was either a denial of due process or even a mistake of law. The questions of law before the Supreme Court were, first, whether the Superior Court had jurisdiction to weigh the evidence; second, whether in rendering its decision it weighed the evidence; and third, whether the valuation of the plaintiff's property was so low that a rate' based upon it would operate to deprive the plaintiff of property without due process of law, would confiscate its property. On each of these questions the Supreme Court found against the contentions of the plaintiff. It held that the Superior Court did not have revisory legislative powers, but only the power to

review questions of law-in the present case, whether there was evidence on which the valuation adopted could reasonably have been found; and in so holding it acted upon the established principle applied in reviewing the findings of administrative boards, that "courts will not examine the facts further than to determine whether there was substantial evidence to sustain the order," Interstate Commerce Commission v. UnionPacificR. R. Co., 222 U. S. 541, 547-548. It, ,therefore, reinstated the order of the Conmmission. But it did. not do so as an appellate court reviewing on the weight of the evidence findings of fact made by the Superior Court. It did so solely because the only question before it was whether there was substantial evidence to support the finding of value; for if the valuation was legally arrived at, the order was confessedly reasonable. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., supra; San Diego Land & Town Co. v. Jasper, 189 U. S. 439, 441, 442. The presumption created by § 23, P. L., p. 1427, by which an order of the Commission is made primafacie evidence of its reasonableness is in no sense a limitation upon the scope of the review. It is in effect the presumption which this court has declared to exist in rate cases, independently of statute, in favor of the conclusion of an experienced administrative body reached after a full hearing. Darnellv. Edwards, 244 U. S. 564, 569.
Secod. As the company had the opportunity for a full judicial review through a suit in equity for an injunction, as it was not denied due process by disregard in the proceedings actually taken of the essentials of judicial process, and since, it is clear that the findings of the Commission were supported by substantial evidence, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania must be affirmed, unless, as contended, the claim of confiscation compels this court to decide, upon the weight of the evidence, whether or not its property has been undervalued or unless some error in law is shown.

The case is here on writ of error to a state court. It is settled that in such cases we accept the facts as there found, not only in actions at law, Dower v. Richards, 151 U. S. 658; but, also, where, as in chancery, the record contains all the evidence and it was open for consideration by and actually passed upon by the highest court of the State, Egan v. Hart, 165 U. S. 188; Waters-PierceOil Co. v. Texas, 212 U. S. 86, 107. And this is true, although the existence of a federal question depends upon the determination of the issue of fact, and although the finding of fact will determine whether or not there has been a taking of property in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Minneapolis & St. Louis R. R. Co. v. Minnesota, 193 U. S. 53, 65. This court may, of course, upon writ of error to a state court "examine the entire record, including the evidence, . . . to determine whether what purports to be a finding upon questions of fact is so involved with and dependent upon questions of law as to be in substance and effect a decision of the latter," Kansas City Southern Ry. Co. v. Albers Commission Co., 223 U. S. 573, 591-593; CedarRapidsGas Light Co. v. CedarRapids, 223 U. S. 655, 668; Grahamv. (Gill,223 U. S. 643, 645. But in order that such examination may be required or be permissible, its purpose must not be to pass upon the relative weight of conflicting evidence, Oregon Railroad & Navigation Co. v. Fairchild,224 U. S. 510, 528, and to substitute the judgment therein of this court for that of the lower court; but to ascertain whether a finding was unsupported by evidence, or whether evidence was properly admitted or excluded, or whether in some other way a ruling was involved which is within the appellate jurisdiction of this court. Northern PacificRy. Co. v. North Dakota,236 U. S. 585, 593; Norfolk & Western Ry. Co. v. West Virginia, 236 U. S. 605.
Here, it is clear, there was substantial evidence to support the findings of the Commission; and no adequate reason is shown for declining to accept as conclusive the

facts found by the state tribunals. See PortlandRailway, Light & Power Co. v. Oregon Railroad Commission, 229 U. S. 397; Miedreich v. Lauenstein, 232 U. S. 236. The rates are predicated on the company's earning seven per cent. net on the value of its property used and useful in the service, after deducting from the income all expenses and charges for depreciation. It is conceded that seven per cent. is a fair return upon the investment and it is not contended that any erroneous rule has been applied in ascertaining the expenses of operation or the depreciation charges. The claim that the rates are confiscatory rested wholly on the contention that the property was undervalued; and on that question the contention is that the' court failed to give due weight to the evidence adduced by the company and that the processes by which the Commission arrived at the value it fixed differed from that often pursued by courts and administrative bodies. To this the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania said: "The ascertainment of the fair value of the property, for rate making purposes, is not a matter of formulas, but it is a matter which calls for the exercise of a sound and reasonable judgment upon a proper consideration of all relevant facts." The objections to the valuation made by the company raise no question of law but concern pure matters of fact; and the finding of the Commission, affirmed by the highest court of the State, is conclusive upon this court. The case at bar is wholly unlike Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Minnesota, 238 U. S. 340; and Union Pacific R. R., Co. v. Public Service Commission of Missouri, 248 U. S. 67, where this court reversed the judgments as matter of law upon the facts found by the Commission.
In my opinion the judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania should be affirmed.

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES and MR. JUSTICE CLARKE concur in this dissent.
