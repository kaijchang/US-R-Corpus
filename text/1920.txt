COCHRAN ET AL., AS SURVIVING EXECUTORS OF COCHRAN, v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No. 116. Argued December 15, 16, 1920.-Decided January 3, 1921.
Section 29 of the War Revenue Act of June 13, 1898, which taxed legacies and distributive shares at so much per hundred dollars of clear value, was repealed by the Act of April 12, 1902, with a proviso saving all taxes imposed by § 29 prior to July 1, 1902, when the repeal became effective. In an action against the United States to recover taxes computed, returned and voluntarily paid by executors after July 1, 1902, on legacies paid over before that date, held:
1. That a formal assessment prior to July 1, 1902, was not necessary to. bring the taxes within the saving clause as taxes "imposed" prior to that date. P. 390.
2. That such assessment was not necessary to ascertain the value of life interests in trust funds, their value being ascertainable by computation upon mortality tables and rules lawfully adopted by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Id. See Simpson v. United ,SUes, 252 U. S. 547.
3. That the fact that the estate was not completely settled and that the legatees and trustee might be liable to refund if retained assets proved insufficient to pay all claims, was no ground for recovery of the taxes, in view of the facts that the personal estate greatly exceeded in value the amount of the legacies, and the total of claims and expenses during many years after the commencement of administration was comparatively insignificant. P. 392.
4. One who seeks to recover money voluntarily paid as a tax upon the ground that the tax was illegal, must prove its illegality and may not rely on mere assertion and speculation. P. 393.

MR. Jus.IcE MCKzNNA delivered the opinion of the court.

Appeal from a judgment of the Court of Claims denying recovery of taxes paid under the War Revenue Act of June 13, 1898, and amendments, upon certain legacies made under the will of William F. Cochran.
The facts so far as we deem them material are as follows: Cochran died in New York, December 27, 1901, leaving a will and a personal estate of the value of $7,918,027.18, of which appellants and Eva S. Cochran were made executors. The latter has since died. The will was probated January 9, 1902, and letters testamentary issued the same date and administration was immediately undertaken and proceeded with without extraordinary or unnecessary delay.
Six months' notice to creditors was given as required by the law of New York and the time for the presentation of claims expired August 4, 1902. Prior to September 30, 1902, debts and claims against the estate were presented and for the most part paid to the aggregate amount of
$98,589.04 of which amount $66,776.25 were paid prior to July 1, 1902. Expenses of administration during that period had been ascertained to be $125,000, of which sum $13,047.16 were paid prior to July 1, 1902. Otherwise, claims and expenses of administration had not been ascertained.
Certain sums were bequeathed to the executors in trust for the children of Cochran and there was also a legacy to a niece and one to a stranger to his blood. Trusts were set up in accordance with the will and the legatees were paid prior to July 1, 1902, the sums provided to be paid. The aggregate payment so made amounted to the sum of $3,140,979.10.

COCHRAN v. UNITED STATES.

387.

Opinion of the Court.

In 1892 And 1893 litigation was instituted against the decedent which might involve the estate, it was estimated, in the payment of several hundred thousand dollars or more. The litigation according'to the findings of the
Court of Claims is still in progress and on account of it money has been retained by the executors that might otherwise have been distributed. The probable outcome of the litigation is not shown.
Under the laws of New York funds in the hands of executors after the expiration of notice to creditors are liable to after-discovered debts, and legatee3 who have received money prior to the expiration of such notice are liable up to the amount paid them for claims subsequently presented. The executors were not secured for the payments to legatees prior to July 1, 1902, and prior to that date the value of the residuary estate had not been ascertained.
In compliance with § 30 of the Act of June 13, 1898, the executors on February'17, 1903, made a return and filed it with the Collector of Internal Revenue giving a schedule of the legacies arising from the personal property of the estate and the amount of tax due thereon. The Collector accepted the schedule as correct. The amount paid to him by the executors w~s the amount they estimated as tl~e amount of the taxes due. The schedule showed the taxes on each legacy and that the total was $158,321.78, which sum was by the Collector paid to the United States.
July 16, 1904, a demand was made upon the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for the repayment to the executors of the sum paid. After one rejection (October 22, 1910), the Commissioner (March 15, 1915), recommended the claim for allowance in the sum of $107,292,24. and
for the rejection of $51,029.54. The recomwmendation was approved by the Secretary of the Treasury. The former sum was paid, the latter was not, and remains unrefunded.

OCTOBER TERM, 1920.

Opinion of the Court.

254 U. S.

This sum was computed in respect to the interest of eight different legatees of which six were residuary legatees, and the computations were made according to certain general rules, tables and instructions for the use of Internal Revenue officers, administrators and trustees in determining the amount of taxes to be paid to the United States upon legacies or distributive shares arising from personal property under the Act of June 13, 1898. There was no special investigation by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue as to the expectancy of life of the several beneficiaries or as to the earning power of the bonds placed in trust for them respectively, and for their benefit.
The contentions of the parties are quite accurately opposed. The appellants contend that an assessment was a necessary condition to the collection of thE taxes and that there was no assessment until after July 1, 1902, and that on that date the law which established the taxes
was repealed. In opposition it is urged by the United States that if an
assessment was necessary the right to make it was reserved by the Repealing Act, and that the appellants, as executors, having made a report of the legacies and the taxes thereon, the report and its acceptance by the Collector of Internal Revenue was -to all intents and purposes an assessment. It is further urged that if an assessment was necessary for the purpose of collecting the taxes, it is now immaterial.
These contentions constitute the issue in the case and depend upon the relation of the law (mostly statutory) to the facts and what it determines. As an element in the determination, the use of the rules of the Department and the mortality tables counsel dismisses from controversy, in concession to Henry v. United States, 251 U. S. 393, and Simpson v. United States, 252 U. S. 547. The remaining element, that is, the necessity of an assessment prior to July 1, 1902, to the validity of the taxes in ques-

Opinion of the Court.

tion, counsel for appellants say, revolves "upon the meaning and application of the word 'imposed,' the fifth word in the special saving clause of the repealing Act of April 12, 1902." And counsel define the word to include all of the steps necessary to the collection of a tax, making it tantamount to "accrued." In other words, the contention is, that a tax is not "imposed" by the simple declaration of a law that property shall be subject to it, but "imposed" only when the tax becomes due and payable, and that the taxes in the present case had not reached that essential condition before July 1, 1902, because they had not been assessed. In. support of the contention, counsel cites Mason v. Sargent, 104 U. S. 689, and Hertz v. Woodman, 218 U. S. 205. There is much in the latter case which, it may be urged, is adverse to the contention, but upon this we are not called upon to pass, for counsel concede that if a statute imposes a tax in such way as that the amount is readily reduced to a certainty, no assessment is necessary. And this is true of the taxes in question.
By § 29 of the Act of June 13, 1898, c. 448, 30 Stat. 448, legacies or distributive shares such as this case is concerned with1 are made subject to a duty at the rate of seventy-five cents for each and every hundred dollars of the clear value thereof and the tax is made a lien and charge for twenty years and its payment required before payment and distribution to the legatees. The section also requires the trustee to make and render to the Collector a schedule, list or statement of the legacies together with the amount of duty that has accrued or shall accrue thereon. Section 30 was amended March 2, 1901, but no change in anything important to the present controversy. Section 29 and the amendments of March 2, 1901, were repealed by Act of April 12, 1902, c. 500, 32 Stat. 97, e

8eq., but it was provided that, all taxes or duties imposed by section twenty-nine . . . and amendments thereof, prior to the taking effect" of the repealing act, should "be subject, as to lien, charge, collection, and otherwise, to the provisions of section thirty . . and amendments thereof, which are hereby continued in force." Except as so continued in force the repealing statute took
effect July 1, 1902. The schedule under § 29 was rendered, as we have seen,
accepted by the Collector, and taxes were paid in accordance therewith, in the sum of $158,321.78.
The schedule included legacies that had been paid after July 1, 1902, but as by Act of June 27, 1902, c. 1160, 32 Stat. 406, such legacies were not subject to a tax, the taxes on them were refunded, upon demand of the executors, but the Government refused to refund the taxes on legacies paid prior to that date. This suit was brought for their amount, that is, the sum of $51,029.54.
To support recovery, it is contended that there was no obligation of payment because, as has already been said, the amount to be paid was not made certain by assessment, or, to quote counsel, was not "so certain (or capable of such ascertainment) that reasonable minds could not disagree and that the exercise of judgment and the consideration and weighing of evidence could not affect the result." For this Hagarv. ReclamationDistrict,111 U. S.
701, and other cases are cited and reviewed. But we cannot agree that there was uncertainty. We
have seen the amount of taxes imposed by the statute was definite and the appellants had no trouble in estimating and returning the value of the legacies upon which it was impoed. The basis of the claim of uncertainty i5that the estate was and is not settled and that there is a possibility that the legatees may be called upon to pay debts. The contention is as strained and baseless as that rejected in Simpson v. United States, supra.

COCHRAN v. UNITED STATES.

387.

Opinion of the Court.

It is to be remembered besides, that the case does not present a case of resistance to the payment of a tax, but of the recovery of taxes voluntarily paid and that, therefore, the illegality of them should be shown not only by averment but by proof, not, as it is attempted to be, by assertion and speculation. It is true that it is averred that prior to July 1, 1902, the amount of claims against the estate had not been ascertained and that there was responsibility upon the trustees and legatees to make a return of the whole or ratable portions of the legacies to the extent that the sums remaining in the estate should be insufficient to satisfy all valid claims. It is conceded, however, the contingency of this might have terminated August 1, 1902, and while itis averred that the clear value of the interests of the legatees was at all times prior to July 1, 1902, uncertain and indefinite, and still is so, there stand in opposition*the facts of the case and the refutation that an estate of the net personal valueof nearly eight million dollars was or is in danger of embarrassment by the payment of legacies of less than one million dollars. And we have seen that the executors
who had knowledge of the condition of the estate, and all that it might be made subject to, did not hesitate to make a return of the legacies to the Collector of Internal Revenue and pay the taxes thereon. The petition in this case was filed in the Court of Claims June 23, 1916, fourteen years after the commencement of the administration of the estate and nearly as long after the time of presentation of claims against it, and the record shows that the total of the claims and expenses of administr-tion, including funeral expenses, amounts to the sum of $235,700. ' in the face of this exhibition we are asked to
speculate upon possibility of the existence of liabilities that fourteen years have not developed.
Judgment affirmed.

heard together in the state courts and here upon the same facts. The Supreme Court of Nevada held that the tax was due and decided in favor of the State. The parties on the other side had set up and claimed immunity under the Constitution of the United States, especially the Fourteenth Amendment, and brought the cases here by writ of error. By way of caution they also filed a petition for certiorari which has not yet been passed upon by this Court.
The facts are these: Henry Miller, a resident of California, was the owner of 119,875.75 shares of the stock of Miller & Lux, Incorporated, a Nevada corporation. Miller & Lux, Inc., owned the stock of the Pacific Live Stock Company, a California corporation, and the latter owned real estate and personal property in Nevada appraised at $1,431,326.86. On April 17, 1913, after the above mentioned statute had been passed but before it went into operation, Miller in California made a will, and at the same time a deed of trust conveying his stock to the plaintiffs in error, in trust for himself for life and after his death upon limitations similar to those in his will-any payment under the will to be in satisfaction of the provisions both in the will and in the deed. The deed contained no power of revocation. The stock was endorsed and delivered to the trustees and thereafter was retained by them. Miller died on October 14, 1916. The statute imposes a tax upon the transfer of all property which shall pass in trust or otherwise by will or by statutes of inheritance or by deed or gift made without valuable and adequate consideration in contemplation of the death of the grantor or donor, or to take effect in possession or enjoyment at. or after such death.
The plaintiffs in error admit that if the statute had been in operation at the time of the transfer the tax would have been due, so that it is not necessary to go into further particulars about the act. But they say that the

interest of the remaindermen after the death of Miller vested upon the execution of the deed and that therefore the statute did not apply to them, and could not do so consistently with the Constitution of the United States.
We shall not discuss the postulate of the argument for the plaintiffs in error-the notion that a tax upon transfers imposed by a statute passed after the transfern had taken place would be void. In this case the statute was passed before the date of the deed of trust and therefore undeniably could have been drawn so as to tax the transaction. Reading as it did it possibly might have been construed as doing so, notwithstanding the postponement of the date for its going into operation, and so construed would have been good as against constitutional objections.
But the plaintiffs in error say that what we pronounce possible is not what the Supreme Court of Nevada did. The Supreme Court of Nevada seems to have conceded that if the interest of those who took upon Miller's death was vested when the deed was delivered the statute did
not and perhaps could not apply. They reached the result by holding that the execution of the deed and will was one transaction and gave no vested right until Mil-
ler's death. Thereupon the plaintiffs in error say that the above limitation to the statute being admitted the State Court could not avoid the supposed constitutional difficulty by assuming a view of the instrument that is deemed to be plainly untenable, as held by the Chief Justice dissenting, and contrary to the law of California
where the parties lived and the transfer was made. Nicke v. State, 179 California, 126. But the answer to this is that when as here there can be no pretence that the
Court adopted its view in order to evade a constitutional issue, and the case has been decided upon grounds that
have no relation to any federal question, this Court accepts the decision whether right or wrong. Enkerprwe

Argument for the United States.

255 U. S.

THE case is stated in the opinion.

The SolicitorGeneraland Mr. Assistant Attorney General
Davis, with whom Mr. T. K. Schmuck, Special Assistant to the Attorney General, was on the brief, for the United
States:
The common-law fiction regards the donor of a power as the source of title to an appointed estate, but the donee's
execution of the power is a transfer of such estate when such execution is requisite to pass title to the appointees. Chanter v. Kelsey, 205 U. S. 466; Luques Appellant, 114 Maine; 235, 340;'Minot v. Treasurer,207 Massachusetts, 588; McFallv. Kirkpatrick,236 Illinois, 281, 306.
It is a well-recognized rule of law that an estate passing under the executior of a general power of appointment is
subject to the payment of debts of the donee of the power. 2 Sugden on Powers, c. 8, par. 7, p. 29; Brandies v. Cochrane, 112 U. S. 344, 352; Knowles v. Dodge, 1 Mack. (D. C.) '66;Duncansonv.

Car. 101; 4 Kent's Com., §§ 339, 340; 22 Am. & Eng. Encyc. of Law, 2nd ed., 1147.
The present case is not concerned with maintenance or disturbance 6f rules of property. The words of the act in question "distribution as part of his estate," § 202 (a), arewords in common use and are therefore to be given their popular meaning. A popular interpretation would include in the estate of a de6eased testatrix property over which she enjoyed substantially all the incidents of ownership and of, which she disposed at her death. See House Doc. No. 1267, p. 101, 65th Cong., 2d sess.
The donee of the power enjoyed the estate during hei life- and had absolute power of disposal at her death.

MR. JUSTICE PITNEY delivered the opinion of the court.

This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Claims sustaining a claim for refund of an estate tax exacted under Title II of the Revenue Act of September 8, 1916, as amended by Act of March 3, 1917 (c. 463, 39 Stat. 756, 777; c. 159, 39 Stat. 1000, 1002). It presents the question whether the act taxed a certain interest that passed under testamentary execution of a general power of appointment created prior but executed subsequent to,
its passage. The facts are as follows: Joseph N. Field, a citizen and
resident of Illinois, died April 29, 1914, leaving a will which was duly admitted to probate in tb State, and by which he gave the residue of his Qstate, after payment of oertaiai

legacies, to trustees, with provision that one-third of it should be set apart and held as a separate trust fund for the benefit of -his-wife,. Kate Field, the net income to be paid to.her during life, and from and after her death the net income of one-half of said share of the trust estate to bb paid to such.persons and ins.uch shares as she should appoint by last-will and teatament. The trust was to continue until the death of the last surviving grandchiId of the testator who was living at the time of his death, and at its termination the undistributed estate wa to be divided among named beneficiaries or their issue, 'per tirpes, in proportions specified. Kate Field died April 29, 1917, a resident of Illinois, leaving a will which was duly probated ir, that.State, by which she executed the power -ofappointment, directing that the income to which the pbwer related shoulc be paid in equal shares to her children surviving at the date of the respective payments, the issue of any deceased child to stand in the place of such deceased child. The collector of internal revenue, assuming to act under the Revenue Act of 1916, as amended, and Regulations issued by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, included as a part of the gross estate of Kate Field the appointed estate passing under her execution of the power; and proceeded to 'assess and collect. an estate tax based upon the net value thereof, and amounting to $121,059.60. Her executor, having paid the tax under protest, and having made 'a claim for refund which was considered and rejected by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, brought this suit and recovered judgment, from which the United States appeals.
The'Reyenue Act of 1916, in § 201 (39 Stat. 777), imposes a tax equal to specified percentages of the value of the net estate "upon the transfer of the net estate of every decedent dying after the passage of this Act." By § 203 (p*. 778) the value of the net estate is to be determined by subtracting from the value of the gross estate certain

specified deductions. The gross estate is to be valued as follows:

Opinion of the Court.

255 U. S.

to impose a tax upon the passing of property under testamentary execution of a power of appointment created before but executed after the passage of the taxing act (see Chan/erv. Kelsey, 205 U. -S.466, 473, 478-479; Knowlton v. Moore, 178 U. S. 41, 56-61), the case involves merely a question of the construction of the act. Applying the accepted canon that the provisions of such acts are not to be extended by implicalion (Gould v. Gould, 245 U. S. 151, 153), we are constrained to the view-notwithstanding the administrative construction adopted by the Treasury Department-that the Revenue Act of 1916 did not impose, an estate tax upon property passing under a testamentary execution of a general power of appointment.
The Government seeks to sustain the tax under both clauses above quoted from § 202.
The conditions expressed in clause (a) are to the effect
that the taxable estate must be (1) an interest of the decedent at the time of his death, (2) which after his death is subject to the payment of the charges against his estate and the expenses of its administration, and (3) is subject to distribution as part of his estate. These conditions :are expressed conjunctively; and it would be inadmissible, in construing a taxing act, to read them as if prescribed disjunctively. Hence, unless the appointed interest fulfilled all three conditions, it was not taxable under this
clause. The chief reliance of the Government is upon the rule,
well established in England and followed geneially, but not universally, in this country, that where one has a general power of appointment either by deed or by will, and executes the power, equity' will regard the property appointed as part of his assets for the payment of his creditors in preference to the claims of his voluntary appointees. See Brandies v. Cochrane, 112 U. S. 344,
352.

Opinion of thb Court.

The English cases are fully reviewed by the House of Lords in O'Gradyv. Wilmot [1916] 2 A. C. 231, 246, et seq. Illustrative, cases in the American courts are Johnson v. Cushing, 15 N. H. 298, 307; Rogers v. Hinton, 62 N. Car. 101, 105; Clappv. Ingraham,126 Massachusetts, 200, 202; Knowles v. Dodge, 1 Mack. (D. C.) 66, 72; Freeman v. Butters, 94 Virginia, 406, 411; Tallmadge v.

497.
It is tacitly admitted that the rule obtains in Illinois,
and we shall so assume. But the existence of the power does not of itself vest any
estate in the donee. Collins v. Wickwire, 162 Massachusetts, 143, 144; Keays v. Blinn, 234 Illinois, 121, 124; Walker v. Treasurer, 221 Massachusetts, 600, 602-603; Shattuck v. Burrage, 229 Massachusetts, 448, 451. See
Carver v. Jackson, 4 Pet. 1, 93. Where the donee dies indebted, having executed the
power in favor of volunteers, the appointed property is treated as equitable, 'not legal, assets of his estate; Clapp v. Ingraham,126 Massachusetts, 200, 203; Patterson& Co. v. Lawrence, 83 Georgia, 703, 707; and (in the absence of
statute), if it passes to the executor at all, it does so not by virtue of his office but as a matter of convenience and because he represents the rights of creditors. O'Grady v. Wilmot [1916] 2 A. C. 231, 248-257; Smith v. Garey, 2 Dev. &.Bat.%Eq. (N. C.) 42, 49; Olney v. Balch, 154 Massachusetts, 318, 322; Emmons v. Shaw, 171 Massachusetts, 410, 411; Hill v. Treasurer, 229 Massachusetts, 474,
477. Where the power is executed, creditors of the donee can
lay claim to the appointed estate only to the extent that the donee's own estate is insufficient to satisfy their de mands. Patterson& Co. v. Lawrence, 83 Georgia, 703, 708'

Walker v. Treasurer, 221 MassAchusetts, 600, 602-603; Shattuck v. Burrage,229 Massachusetts, 448, 452.
It is settled that (in the absence of statute). creditors have no redress in case of a failure to execute the power. Holmes v. Coghill, 7 Ves. 499, 507, affirmed, 12 Ves. 206, 214-215; Gilmanv. Bell, 99 Illinois, 144, 150; Duncansonv. Manson, 3 App. D. C. 260, 273.
And, whether the power be or be not exercised, the property that was subject to appointment is not subject to distribution as part of. the estate of the donee. If there be no appointment, it goes according to the disposition of the donor. If there be an appointment to volunteers, then, subject to whatever charge creditors may have against it, it goes not to the next of kin or the legatees of the donee, but to his appointees under the power.
It follows that the interest in question, not having been property bf Mrs. Field at the time of her death, nor subject to distribution as part of her estate, was not taxable under clause (a-).,
We deem it equally clear that it was not within clause (b). That clause is the complement of (a), and is aptly descriptive of a transfer of an intereft in decedent's own property in his lifetime, intended to -take effect at or after his death. It cannot, without undue laxity of construction, be made to cover a transfer resulting from a testamentary execution by decedent of a power of appointment over property not his own.
It would have been easy for Congress to express a purpose to tax property passing under a general power of 'appointment exercised by a decedent had such a purpose existed; and none was expressed in the act under consideration. In that, of February 24, 1919, which took its place, the-section providing how the value of the gross estate of the 'decedent shall be determined contains a clause precisely to the point [§ 402 (e), 40 Stat. 10971: "To the extent of any property passing under a general power of

appointment exercised by the decedent (1) by will, or (2) by deed executed in contemplation of, or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after, his death, except," etc. Its insertion indicates that Congress at least was doubtful whether the previous act included property passing by appointment. See Matter of Miller, 110 N. Y. 216, 222; Matter of Harbeck, 161 N. Y. 211, 217-218; United States v. Bashaw, 50 Fed. Rep. 749, 754. The Government contends that the amendment was made for the purpose of clarifying rather than extending the law as it stood, and cites a statement to that effect in the Report of the House Committee on Ways and Means (House Doc. No. 1267, p. 101, 65th Cong., 2d sess.). It is evident, however, that this statement was based upon the interpretation of the Act of 1916 adopted by the Treasury Department; the same report proceeded to declare (p. 102) that "The absence of a provision including property transferred by power of appointment makes it possible, by resorting to the creation of such a power, to effect two transfers of an estate with the payment of only one tax;" and this, together with the fact that the committee proposed that the law be amended, shows that the Treasury construction was not treated as a safe reliance.
The tax in question being unsupported by the taxing act, the Court of Claims was right in awarding reimbursement.
Judgment affirmed.

THE case is stated in the opinion.
.Mr. Albert M. Kales, with whom Mr. Walter L. Fisher
was on the brief, for plaintiff in error: Assuming that the Income Tax Act of 1916, as amended
by the Act of 1917, attempted to tax as income the increase in value since March 1, -1913, or date of purchase subsequent to that time, of the stock and bonds in ques-
tion upon the ascertainment of the increment of value by conversion or redemption, the act was in violation of the Constitution.
In accordance with the statement of this court in Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U. S. 189, 206, it is now settled that the mere increase in the value of capital assets, prior to any co nversion or redemption, -is not "income "within
the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment. Gray v. Dar-
lingq(on, 15 Wall. 63, 66; Lynch v. Turrih, 247 U. S. 221, 231.
The conversion by the trustee does not cause the increase in the value of capital assets to be "income," for
the reason that the increase after the single isolated

event bf conversion still remains capital just the same as it was before. The increase after conversion remaied a mer6 "gain' accruing to capital," or ".a growth'or increment of value in the inv-estment."

The conversion and redemption in the case at bar do not caue the increase in the value of capital assets of the trust estate to be income because the gain or increae has not been "derived," that is, received or drawn bythe recipient (the taxpayer) for his-sparat6 use;: benefit .and *disposal. Eisner v. Mazomber, supra, 207, 211; 21-4; 215:
In the case of a trustee who converts a capital asset which he has received by devise, there can be no profit or gain upon which to base any claim of income.:
Even, however,. where the legal and beneficial owner
of capital assets sells them at a profit as a singleieolated transaction (he not being in any sense in the business Of buying and selling for profit), the gain is not income within the Sixteenth Amendment.

The gains in the value of the capital assets of a legal and beneficial owner, ascertained by conversion as a single isolated event, are not taxable as income under § 2 (a) or (c).
The act in particular contains no provision for the taxation of any increase in value of the capital assets of a trust estate held for life tenant and remainderman ascertained on conversion as a single isolated event.

The Solicitor General for defendant in error: Assuming that the act treats gains derived by an individual from the sale of property as taxable income, it clearly provides for a tax to be paid by a trustee under the facts of this case. The act clearly treats as taxable income any gain which is derived from the sale of property; that is, the conversion of capital assets. Gains derived from" the conversion of capital assets
constitute income which Congress may constitutignally

Ever since the passage of the Act of 1909, the administrative department of the Government has construed the word "income " as including profits derived from the conversion of capital assets. 'This construction was expressly approved by this court in 1918, and millions of dollars of taxes have been collected both under the Act of 1909 and the subsequent income tax laws on that basis. Doyle v. Mitchell Brothers Co., 247 U. S. 179, 185188.
Gray v. Darlington, 15 Wall. 63, is not authority for the contention that profits derived from the sale of capital assets are not income. Hays v. Gauley Mountain Coal Co., 247 U. S. 189, 191; Lynch v. Turrish, 247 U. S. 221, 227, 230; Doyle v. Mitchell Brothers Co., supra;Uhited States v. Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago & St. Louis Ry. Co., 247 U. S. 195; Southern Pacific Co. v. Lowe, 247 U. S. 330, 334; Lynch v. Hornby, 247 U. S. 339.
The fact that under the laws of most of the States gains derived from the' profitable sale of capital assets are, as between life tenant and remainderman, treated as principal and not as income, can not operate to prevent such gains being income when clearly included in the definition of income as adopted by an act of Congress.
Neither is there any constitutional difficulty because Congress has seen fit to tax all of such gains in the year in which they are received.
When capital assets are converted into cash, and the original capital is withdrawn from the proceeds, the income remains segregated and subject to separate use.. Eisner v. Macomber, supra, 211, 213.
The gains received by a trustee under a will by the profitable sale of capital assets purchased by the testator in his lifetime, are measured in precisely the same way

they would have been measured if the latter had lived and made the sale himself.
- he question as to whether there is income in the sale
of property at a loss as compared with its cost prior to 1913, but at an advance over its value on March 1, 1913, is not now involved.

Mn. JusTIcE CLARxK delivered the opinion of the court.

A writ of error brings this case here for review of a judgment of the District Court of the United States -for the Northern District of Illinois, sustaining a demurrer to a dcclaration in assumpsit to recover an assessment of taxes for the year 1917, made under warrant of the Income Tax Act of Congress, approved September 8, 1916, c. 463, 39
Stat. 756, as amended by the Act approved October 3, 1917, c. 63, 40 Stat. 300. Payment was made under protest and the claim to recover is based upon the contention that the fund taxed was not "income" within the scope of the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and that the effect given by the lower court to the
act of Congress cited renders it umconstitutional and void. This is sufficient to sustain the writ of error. Tomne v.
Eime'r,24U. S.418. Arthur.Ryerson died in 1912, and the plaintiff in error is
trustee under his will, of property the net income of which was directed to be paid to his widow during her life and after her duath to be used for the benefit of his children, or their, representatives, until each child should arrive at,
twenty-five years of age, when each should receive his or her share of the trust fund.
The trustee was given the fullest.possible dominion over the trust estate. It was made the final judge as to what "net income" of the estate should be, and its determina-
tion in this respect was made binding upon all parties interested therein, "except that it is my will that stock

MERCHANTS' L. & T. CO. v. SMIETANKA. 515

5W9.

Opinion of the Court.

dividends and accretions of selling values shall be considered principal and not income."
The widow and four children were living in 1917. Among the assets which came to the custody of the trustee were 9,522 shares of the capital stock of Joseph T. Ryerson & Son, a corporation. It is averred that the cash value of these shares, on March 1, 1913, was $561,798, and that they were sold for $1,280,996.64, on February 2, 1917. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue treated the difference between the value of the stock on March 1, 1913, and the amount for which it was sold on February 2, 1917, as income for the year 1917, and upon that amount assessed the tax which was paid. No question is made as. to the amount of the tax if the collection of it was lawful. The ground of the protest, and the argument for the plaintiff in error here, is that the sum charged as" income" represented appreciation in the value of the capital assets of the estate which was not "income" within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment and therefore could not, constitutionally, be taxed, without apportionment, as required by § 2, el. 3, and by § 9, cl. 4, of Article I of the Constitution of the United States. It is first argued that the increase in value of the stock could not be lawfully taxed under the act of Congress because it was not income to the widow, for she did not receive it in 1917, and never can receive it, that it was not income in that year to the children for they did not then, and may never, receive it, and that it was not income to the trustee, not only because the will creating the trust required that "stock dividends and accretions of selling values shall be considered principal and not income," but also because in the "common understanding" tFe term "income" does not comprehend such a gain or profit as we have here, which it is contended is really an accretion to capital and therefore not constitutionally taxable under Eisnerv. Macomber, 252 U. S. 189.

516

OCTOBER TERM, 1920.

Opinion of the Court.

255 U. S.

The provision of the will may be disregarded. It was not within the power of the testator to render the fund non-taxable.
Assuming for the present that there was constitutional power to tax such a gain or profit as is here involved, are the terms of the statute comprehensive enough to in-
clude it? Section 2 (a) of the Act of September 8, 1916 (39 Stat.
757; 40 Stat. 300, 307, § 212), applicable to the case, defines the income of "a taxable person" as including "gains, profits and income derived from . . . sales, or dealings in property, whether real or personal, growing out of the ownership or use of or interest in real or personal property, . . or gains or'profits and income derived from any.source whatever."
Plainly the gain we are considering was derived from the sale of personal property, and, very certainly the comprehensive last clause "gains or profits and income derived from any source whatever," must also include it, if the trustee was a "taxable person" within the meaning of the act when the assessment was made.
That the trustee was Such a "taxable person" is clear from § 1204 (1) (c) of the Act of October 3, 1917, c. 63, 40 Stat. 331, which requires that "trustees, executors
.:.. and all persons, corporations, or associations, acting in any fiduciary capacity, shall make and render a return of the income of the person, trust, or estate for whom or which theyact, and be subject to all the provisions of this title which apply to individuals."
And-§ 2 (b) of the Act of September 8, 1916, supra,specifically declares that the "income received by estates of deceased persons during the period of administration or settlement of the estate, . . . or any kind of property held intrust, including such income accumulated in trust for the benefit of unborn or unascertained persons, or persons, with contingent interests, and income held for

MERCHANTS' L. & T. CO. v. SMIETANKA.

Opinion of the Court.

future distribution under the terms of the will or trust shall be likewise taxed, the tax in each instance, excopt when the income is returned for the purpose of the tax by the beneficiary, to be assessed to the executor, admidstrator, or trustee, as the case may be."
Further, § 2 (c) clearly shows that it was the purpose of Congress to tax gains, derived from such a sale as we have here, in the manner in which this fund was assessed, by providing that "for the purpose of ascertaining the gain derived from the sale or other disposition of property, real, personal, or mixed, acquired before March first, nineteen hundred and thirteen, -the fair market price or value of such property as of March first, nineteen hundred and thirteen, shall be the basis for determining the amdunt of such gain derived."
Thus, it is the plainly expressed purpose of the act of Congress to treat such a trustee as we have here as a "taxable person" and for the purposes of the act to deal with the income received for others precisely as if the beneficiaries had received it in person.
There remains the question, strenuously argued, whether this gain in four years of over $700,000 on an investment of about $500,000 is "income" within the
meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution
of the United States. The question is one of definition and the answer to it
may be found in recent decisions of this court. The Corporation Excise Tax Act of August 5, 1909,
c. 6, 36 Stat. 11, 112, was not an income tax law, but a definition of the word "income" was so necessary ' its administration that in an early case it was formulat ,d as
"the gain derived from capital, from labor, or from both combined." Straon's Independnce v. Howbert, 231 U. S. 399, 415.
This definition, frequently approved by this court, received an addition, in its latest income tax decision, which

518

OCTOBER TERM, 192D

255 U .8.

is especially significant in its application, to such a case as we have here, so that it now reads: ."'Income may be defined as the gain derived from capital, from labor, or from both combined,' provided it be understood to include profit gained through a sale or conversion of capital assets.': Eisnerv. Macomber, 252 U. S. 189, 207.
The use made of this definition of "income" in the decision of cases arising under the Corporation Excise Tax Act of August 5, 1909, and under the Income Tax Acts is, we think, decisive of the -case before us. Thus, in two cases arising under the Corporation Excise Tax Act:
In Hays v. Gauley Mountain Coal Co., 247 U. S. 189,, a coal company, without corporate authority to trade in stocks, purchased shares in another coal mining company in 1902, which -itsold in 1911, realizing a profit of $210,000. Over the same objection made in this case, that the fund wasmerely converted capital, this court held that so much of the profit upon the Wle of the stock as accrued subsequent to the effective date of the act was properly treated as income received during 1911, in assessing the tax for
that year. In United States v. Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago &
St. Louis Ry. Co., 247 U. S. 195, arailroad company purchased shares of stock in another railroad company in 1900 which it sold in 1909, realizing a profit of $814,000. 'Here, again, over the same objection, this court held that the part of the profit which accrued subsequent-to the effective date of the act was properly treated as income received during the year 1909 for the purposes of the act.
Thus, from the price realized. from the sale of stock by two investors, as distinguished from. dealers, and from, a single transaction as distinguished from a course of business; the value of the stock on the effective date of the tax act was deducted and the resulting gain was treated by this court as "incomeP' by which the tax was measured.

case at bar if the word "income" has the same meaning in the Income Tax Act of 1913 that it had in the Corporation Excise Tax Act of 1909, and that it has the same scope of meaning was in effect decided in 8outhern Pacific Co. v. Lowe, 247 U. S. 330, 335; where it was assumed for the purposes of decision that there was no difference in. its meaning as used in the Act of 1909 and in the Income Tax Act of 1913. There can be no doubt that the word must be given the same meaning and content in the Income Tax Acts of 1916 and 1917 that it had in the Act of 1913. When to this we add that in Eier v. Macomber, eupra, a case arising under the same Income Tax Act of 1916 which is here involved, the definition of "income" which was applied was adopted from Stratton'sIndependence v. Howbert, 8upra, arising under the Corporation Excise Tax Act of 1909, with the addition that it should include "profit
j;ained through a sale or conversion of capital assets," there would seem to be no room to doubt that the word must be given the same meaning in all of the Income Tax Acts of Congress that was given to it in the Corporation. Excise Tax Act and that what that meaning is has now become definitely settled by decisions of this court.
In determining the definition of the word "income" thus arrived at, this court has consistently refused to enter into the refinements of lexicographers or economists and has approved, in the definitions quoted, What it believed to. be the commonly understood meaning of the term which must have been in the minds of the people when they adopted the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution.

as determined by the trustee as of March 1, 1913, it is palpable that it was a "gain or profit" "produced by" or "derived from" that investment, and that it "proceeded," and was "severed" or rendered severable, from it, by the sale for cash, and thereby became that "realized gain" which has been repeatedly declared to be taxable income within the meaning of the constitutional amendment and the acts of Congress. Doyle v. Mitchell Brothers Co., and Eisner v. Macomber, supra.
It is elaborately argued in this case, in No. 609, Eldorado Coal & Mining Co. v. Mager, post, 522, submitted with it, and in other cases since argued, that the word -'income" as used in the Sixteenth Amendment and in the Income Tax Act we are considering does not include the gain from capital realized by a single isolated sale of property but that only the profits realized from sales by one engaged in buying and selling as a business-a merchant, a real estate agent, or broker--constitute income which may be taxed.
It is sufficient to say, of this contention, that no such distinction was recognized in the Civil War Income Tax Act of 1867, c. 169, 14 Stat. 471, 478, or in the Act of 1894, c. 349, 28 Stat. 509, 553, declared unconstitutional on an unrelated ground; that it was not recognized in determining income under the Excise Tax Act of 1909, Ls the cases cited, supra, show; that it is not to be found, in terms, in any of the income tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Acts of 1913, 1916, 1917 or 1919; that the definition of the word "income" as used in the Sixteenth Amendment, which has been developed by this court, does-not recognize any such distinction; that in departmental practice, for now seven years, such a rule has not been applied; 'and -that there is no essential difference in the nature pf the transaction or in the relation of the profit to the. capital involved, whether the sale or conversion be a single, isolated transaction or one of many.

MERCHANTS' L. & T. CO. v. SMIETANKA. 521

509.

Opinion of the Court.

The interesting and ingenious argument, which is earnestly pressed upon us, that this distinction is so fundamental and obvious that it must be assumed to be a part of the "general understanding" of the meaning of the word " income" fails to convince us that a construction should be adopted which would, in a large measure, defeat the purpose of the Amendment.
The opinions of the courts in dealing with the rights of life tenants and remaindermen in gains derived from invested capital, especially in divideuds paid by corporations, are of little value in determining such a question as we have here, influenced as such decisions are by the terms of the instruments creating the trusts involved and by the various rules adopted in the various jurisdictions for attaining results thought to be equitable. Here the trustee, acting within its powers, sold the stock, as it might have sold a building, and realized a profit of $700,000, whizh at once became assets in its possession free for any disposition within the scope of the trust but for the purposes of taxation to be treated as if the trustee were the sole owner.
Gray v. Darlington, 15 Wall. 63, much relied upon in argument, was sufficiently distinguished irom cases such as we have here in Hays v. Gauley Mountain Coal Co., 247 U. S. 189, 191. The differences in the statutes involved render inapplicable the expressions in the opinion in that case (not necessary to the decision of it) as to distinctions between income and increase of capital.
In Lynch v. Tuiish, 247 U. S. 221, also much relied upon, it is expressly stated that, "according to the fact admitted, there was no increase after that date [March 1, 19131 and therefore no increase subject to the law." For this reason the questions here discussed and decided were not there presented.
The British income tax decisions are interpretations of statutes so wholly different in their wording from the

Another assessment on a. small gain realized upon a purchase, made in 1914, of bonds which were duly called for redemption and paid in 1917, does not present any questions other than those which We have discussed and therefore it does not call for separate consideration.

claimed to have been erroneously exacted from them as a tax on the income of his estate while in their hands.
The testator died December 15, 1917. The Revenue Act of 1916 1"imposed upon the transfer of the net estate of every decedent " dying thereafter a tax which it called an "estate tax." The act fixed the amount of the tax at a named percentage "' of the value of the net estate," made the tax a lien upon the "entire gross estate," required that it be paid "out of the estate " before distribution, declared that it should "be due one year after the decedent's death," charged the executor or administrator with the duty of paying it, and declared that the receipt therefor should entitle him to a credit for the amount in the usual settlement of his accounts. Under that act these executors were required to pay an estate tax of $489,834.07. The tax became due December 15, 1918, and they paid it February 8, 1919. Shortly thereafter the executors made a return, under the Revenue Act of 1918,2 of the income of the testator's estate for the taxable year 1918 and claimed in the return that in ascertaining the net income for that year the estate tax of $489,834.07 should be deducted. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue refused to allow the deduction and assessed an income tax of $165,075.78 against the estate. Had the deduction been allowed there would have been no taxable net income for that year and no part of the $165,075.78 would have been collectible. Payment of that.sum, as so assessed, was pressed on the executors and they paid it under duress. Then, after taking the necessary steps to entitle them to do so, they brought this suit in the Court of Claims to recover the money thus exacted from them.
The sole question for decision is, was the estate tax

paid by the executors, and claimed by them as a deduction in the income tax return for the year 1918, an allowable deduction in ascertaining the net taxable income of the estate for that year? The Court of Claims held that it was. 56 Ct. Clms. 133.
The solution of the question turns entirely upon the statutory provisions under which the two taxes were severally collected. The Act of 1918, by §§ 210, 211 and 219, subjects the net income "received by estates of deceased persons during the period of administration or settlement " to an income tax measured by fixed percentages thereof; by §§ 212 and 219 requires that the net income be ascertained by taking the gross income,
as defined in § 213, and making the deductions named in
§ 214, and by § 214 makes express provision for the deduction of "taxes paid or accrued within the taxable year imposed (a) by the authority of the United States, except income, war-profits and excess-profits taxes." This last provision is the important one here. It is not ambiguous, but explicit, and leaves little room for construction. The words of its major clause are comprehensive and include every tax which is charged against the estate by the anthority of the United States. The excepting clause specifically enumerates what is to be excepted. The implication from the latter is that the taxes which it enumerates- would be within the major clause were they not expressly excepted, and also that there was no purpose to except any others. Estate taxes were as well known at the time the provision was framed as the ones particularly excepted. Indeed, the same act, by §§ 400410, expressly provides for their continued imposition
and enforcement. Thus their omission from the excepting clause means that Congress did not intend to except them.
The Act of 1916 calls the estate tax a "tax" and particularly denominates it an "estate tax." This court recently has recognized that it is a duty or excise and is

imposed in the exertion of the taxing power of the United States. New York Trust Co. v. Eisner, ante, 345. It is made a charge on the estate and is to be paid out of it by the administrator or executor substantially as other taxes and charges are paid. It becomes due not at the time of the decedent's death, as suggested by counsel for the Government, but one year thereafter, as the statute plainly provides. It does not segregate any part of the estate from the rest and keep it from passing to the administrator or executor for purposes of administration, as counsel contend, but is made a general charge on the gross estate and is to be paid in money out of any available funds or, if there be none, by converting other property into money for the purpose.
Here the estate tax not only "accrued," which means became due, during the taxable year of 1918, but it was paid before the income for that year was returned or required to be returned. When the return was made the executors claimed a deduction by reason of that tax. We hold that under the terms of the Act of 1918 the deduction should have been allowed.

Mx. JusTcE HoTiS delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a suit brought by the executors of one Purdy to recover an estate tax levied under the Act of Congress of September 8, 1916, c. 463, Title II, § 201, 39 Stat. 756, 777, and paid under duress on December 14, 1917. According to the complaint Purdy died leaving a will and codicil directing that all succession, inheritance and transfer taxes should be paid out of the residuary estate, which was bequeathed to the descendants of his brother. The value of the residuary estate was $427,414.96, subject to some administration expenses. The executors had been required to pay and had paid inheritance and succession taxes to New York ($32,988.97) and other States ($4,780.91) amounting in all to $37,769.88. The gross estate as defined in § 202 of the act of Congress was $769,799.39; funeral expenses and expenses of administration, except the above taxes, $61,322.08; leaving a net value for the payment of legacies, except as reduced by the taxes of the United States, of $670,707.43. The plaintiffs were compelled to pay $23,910.77 to the United States, no deduction of any part of the above mentioned $37,769.88 being allowed. They allege that the act of Congress is
unconstitutional, and also that it was misconstrued in not allowing a deduction of state inheritance and succession taxes as charges within the meaning of § 203. On demurrer the District Court dismissed the suit.
By § 201 of the act, "a tax . . . equal to the following percentage, of the value of the net estate, to be

determined a provided in section two hundred and three,

u hereby imposed upon the transfer of the net estate

of every decedent dying after the passage of this Act,"

with percentages rising from one per centum of the amount

of the net estate not in exess of $50,000 to ten per centum

of the amount in exess of $5,000,000. Section 202 gives

the mode of determining the value of the gross estate.

Then, by § 203 it is enacted "That for the purpose of the

tax the value of the net estate shall be determined-(a) In

the case of a resident, by deducting from the value of the

gram estate-(1) Such amounts for funeral expenses,

adminitration expeses, claims against the estate, un-

paid mortgages, loses incurred during the settlement

of the estate arising from fires, storms, shipwreck, or

other casualty, and from theft, when such losses are not

the settlement of the estate of those dependent upon the

decedent, and such other charges against the estate, as

are allowed by the laws of the jurisdiction, whether within

or without the United States, under which the estate is being administered; and (2) an exemption of $50,000."

The tax is to be due in one year after the decedent's death.

§ 204. Within thirty days after qualifying the executor

is to give written notice to the collector and later to make

return of the grs estate, deductions allowed, net estate

shall be paid out of the estate before its distribution." These provisions are assailed by the plaintiffs in error
as an unconstitutional interference with the rights of the States to regulate descent and distribution, as unequal and as a direct tax not apportioned as the Constitution
requires. The statement of the constitutional objections urged
imports on its face a distinction that, if correct, evidently hitherto has escaped this Court. See United States v. Field, 255 U. S. 257. It is admitted, as since Knowlton v. Moore, 178 U. S. 41, it has to be, that the United States has power to tax legacies, but it is said that this tax is cast upon a transfer while it is being effectuated by the State itself and therefore is an intrusion upon its processes, whereas a legacy tax is not imposed until the process is complete. An analogy is sought in the difference bet-wem the attempt of a State to tax commerce among the States and its right after the goods have become mingled with the general stock in the State. A consideration of the parallel is enough to detect the fallacy. A tax that was directed solely against goods imported into the State and that was determined by the fact of importation would be no better after the goods were at rest in the State than before. It would be as much an interference with commerce in one case as in the other. Dwrel & Son Co. v. Memphis, 208 U. S. 113. Welton v. Missouri, 91 U. S. 275. Conversely if a tax on the property distributed by the laws of a State, determined by the fact that distribution has been accomplished, is valid, a tax determined by the fact that distribution is about to begin is no greater interference and is equally good.
Knowlton v. Moore, 178 U. S. 41, dealt, it is true, with a legacy tax. But the tax was met with the same objection; that it usurped or interfered with the exercise of state powers, and the answer to the objection was based upon general considerations and treated the "power to transmit

s all standing on the same footing. 178 U. & 57, 59.

After the daborate discussion that the subject received

intthi c we thk it sa to dwel upon matters

that in princ*Ie wene disposed of there. The same may

be maid of the argument that the tax is direct and there-

fore is void for want of apportionment It is argued that

when the tax is on the privilege of receiving, the tax is

indirect because it may be avoided, whereas here the tax

is nevitable and therefore direct. But that matter also

i disposed of by Knwtmo v. Moore, not by an attempt

to make some scientific distinction, which would be at

least difficult, but on an interpretation of language by

its traditional use-on the 'practical and historical ground

that this kind of tax always has been regarded as the

antitbesis of a direct tax; "has ever been treated as a

duty or emmse, because of the particular occasion which

gives rime to its levy." 178 U. & 81-8 Upon this point

a page of history is worth a volume of logic.

The iequaliti charged upon the statute, if there is so bdamy, wre all inequwliti in the-amounts gta

beneficiaris might receive in case of estates of different yahues, of different prportkms between real and personal etate, and of different numbers of recipients; or if there is a will affect legatees. As to the inequalities in case of a wil they must be taken to be contemplated by the testator. He kmws the law and the consequences of the disposition fthat be voomk. As to intestate succemssors the tax is not impmedI upon then but precedes them and the fact that they may reeeive les or different sums because of the statute does not concern the United States.
thee remaims only the construction of the act. The argunut against its. constitutionality is based upon a premise that is unfavorable to the contntion of the
plaintiffs in &rorupon this point. For if the tax attaches to the estate before distribution-if it is a tax on the right

to transmit, or on the transmision at its beginning, obviously it attaches to the whole estate except so far as the statute sets a limit. "Charges against the estate" as pointed out by the Court below are only charges that affect the estate as a whole, and therefore do not include taxes on the right of individual beneficiaries. This reasoning excludes not only the New York succession tax but those paid to other States, which can stand no better than that paid in 'New York. What amount New York may take as the basis of taxation and questions of priority between the United States and the State are not open in this case.
