STARKWEATHER v. JENNER.
AII'AL FIOM THE COIRT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF C:OLUtMIiA.
No. 114. Argued January 28, 1910-Decided February 28, 1910.
In this case the charges of fraud and collusion on the part of the defendants axe wholly unsupported.
The rule that equity may convert into a trustee a co-tenrant who attempts to buy an outstanding hostile title does not apply where the common property is sold at bona fide public sale under legal process or power in a trust (Iced. At such a sale, and in the absence of fraud or deceit, any.one of the co-tenants is as free to buy as any of the general public, and several of the co-tenants may combine without notice to the others to purchase for themselves.
A judicial sale for inadequate price resulting from combination of bidders is voidable, not void, and one who would complain must after discovery seasonably elect whether he will avoid it or not. A delay of four years where the property is of speculative character an(l has largely increased in value ineanwhile is unreasonable.

MR. JUSTICE LURToN delivered the opinion of the court.
The appellant, George B. Starkweather, was the owner of a parcel of unimproved land known as the Crescent Heights, in Washington, D. C., composed of two contiguous lots, one of seven and the other of three acres. In January, 1892, pursuant to a plan arranged between himself and certain persons associated with him, and styled herein tile syndicate,

Opinion of the Court.

he conveyed this tract to defendants Croissant and Johnson,

as trustees, for the benefit of the persons who should con-

tribute to the purchase price, as tenants in common, in the

share and proportion in which they respectively contributed,

with power to control, manage, lease, sell and convey, in

their discretion, as should be desirable or advantageous to

the l)arties interested. Those contributing or proposing to

contribute agreed among themselves, by a separate paper,

that the price, including the discharge of incumbrances rest-.

ing upon the property, should be $75,000, divided into shares

of $2,500 each, and each person accordingly 'subscribed for

such number of shares as they elceted to take, agreeing that

Croissant and Johnson should represent them as trustees in

the purchase, with full power to manage, sell and convey,

receiving a commission for their service. Among those so

contributing originally, or by substitution, were the trustees

Croissant and Johnson, the appellant Starkwcather, who was

to receive, and did take, eleven shares, fully paid up, as and for part of the purchase price, and the appellee Jenner, who

ultimately came to own four of such shares. The full number

of thirty shares contemplated were never subscribed, six

remaining unsold in the hands of the trustees. This fact, from

whatever cause, seems to have led to the inability of the

syndicate to pay off the incumbrances which were to be

assumed and paid off as part 'of the price. Among these

incumbrances -were several deeds in trust or mortgages secur-

ing obligations of the vendor appellant.

The certificates to subscribers were issued by Croissant and

Johnson, and recited, among other things, that they.lield the

property in trust, and that the holder was a contributor to

the purchase price.to the extent of $2,500, and the owner

of an undivided one-thirtieth interest, and that such interest "shall at all times be subject to assessment for its propor-

tionate part of money necessary to pay expenses incurred

in the execution of the trusts as provided in the deed to said

trustee,

'and in default of such payment the said

trustees . . are hereby authorized to sell the intrest of such person so in default," etc.
Out of the money paid in by the subscribers a part was used by the trustees in paying off incumbrances, keeping down interest and in other expenses, but something like ,eleven thousand dollars was paid over in money to or on account of the vendor Starkweather.
Among the trusts upon the property was a deed in trust
upon the seven-acre parcel to the appellees, Duval and Cole, as trustees, to secure ali obligation created by Starkweather for $7,553.34 to a Mr. Gaither, executed January 29, 1889, and maturing in four years. In 1893 this debt matured. By agreement the enforcement of the trust was postponed upon payment of interest. But, finally, there was a default and a sale directed by Gaither. The property was, accordingly, advertised by the trustees and sold at public outcry in 1897 and bid in by one Ricker, acting for and as agent of the appellant. The time for complying with the sale by Ricker was extended upon the payment by appellant of 1$300 for each of two extensions. Default-in complying with the terms of sale was, however, again made, and the property readvertised. Appellant attempted to forbid such resale, and filed a bill for that purpose, which was not dismissed until February, 1898, when the property was again advertised and offered for sale by Duval and Cole, the trustees, and knocked down to one Silver, acting as an agent for Starkweather. The terms of this second sale were not complied with, and the property was at once recried apd sold to the appellee Jenner for $17,100, acting, as it turned out, for himself and certain, others, vho, like Jenner, were members of the original purchasing syndicate, or holders of certificates acquired later from those who were. Jenner complied with the terms of sale and paid the full purchase money and accepted a deed from the trustees. After paying off the Gaither debt the remainder of the price paid by Jenner was distributed to other lienors, under a bill in equity filed for that purpose, under which final

Opinion of the Court.

decrees have long since been made and the trustees exoner-
ated. The object of the present bill is to set aside this deed by
Duval and Cole to the appellee Jenner, and revest the title in Croissant and Johnson as trustees for the syndicate; or, in the alternative, declare Jenner a trustee holding the seven-acre parcel, after his reimbursement, for the benefit of the syndicate subscribers.
The charges of the bill abound in accusations of fraudulent collusion between Jenner and the other appellees to bring this seven-acre lot to sale under the Duval and Cole trust, and thereby the elimination of appellant as the largest holder of certificates in the syndicate. It is among other things said that Croissant and Johnson wilfully suffered a default. That they had certificates unsold and money in their hands and power to. assess the members'of the syndicate to raise means to pay off the incumbrance and thus save the property for the benefit of all concerned; but had wilfully and collusively let the property be brought to sale, and in fact, persuaded Gaither or his trustees to proceed under the trust. These charges of collusion or fraudulent conduct upon the pait of either Gaither, the creditor, or his trustees, Duval and Cole, -are utterly unsupported. Their course was from beginning to end, so far as this record shows, dictated by prudent business conduct, and great consideration for apl)ellant in his natural desire to prevent an enforcement of the trust. So far as Croissant and Johnson are concerned, it is not shown that they had in any way colluded with either .the creditor, his trustees, or with the purchaser at the Duval and Cole sale, or that they had the slightest interest in the acquisition. of this seven-acre tract by Jenner or his ass6ciatcs. They are not shown to have misapplied the funds of the syndicate, or to have had any funds with which to meet and pay off either the principal or interest of the Gaither debt. That they did not assess the shareholders, as they might have, done under the terms- of the trust to raise money to

But it is plain that the principle which turns a co-tenant

can have no proper application to a public sale (f the, con-

mon pi*ol)erty, either uider legal process or a plower in a

trust deed. In such a situation, the sale not being ill any wise

the result of collusion nor subject to the control of such a

bidder, he is as free, all deeei and fraud out of the way, as

any one of the general public.

Even a trustee has been held competent to purchase the

trust property at a judicial sale, which he has, no interest in,

nor any part in bringing about, and which sale he in no way

controls. Twin Lick Oil Company v. Marbury, 91 U. S. 587;

STARKWEATHER v. JENNER.

216 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

But it is said that if there is no absolute prohibition upon one co-owner buying at an open sale of the common property to satisfy a mortgage or other incumbrance thereon, that at least the fiduciary character and common interest due to such a cotenancy require of one who buys the utmost fairness of conduct. Concede this. It is then said, that Jenner at the bidding held a power of attorney from three others of the syndicate members, by which he was to bid the property in for their mutual benefit at the lowest price possible, and at a price not exceeding $24,000. That he held this power of attorney and had undertaken to buy at as low a price as possible was not known to appellant and that this "secret combination," as it is styled' and designated, was a fraud upon him. It is plain from the facts of this case that the scheme for exploiting this Crescent Heights property, according to the agreement exhibited- by the share certificates, had practically collapsed, and that for the want of means and harmony among the owners there was-no practical way of clearing the property from incumbrances, which had turned out to be about $39,000, a sum larger than seems to have been originally supposed. There was nothing left but for the members of the syndicate to put their hands into their own pockets and put in a large additional sum or let the incumbrances be enforced. This latter is just what happened. In such circumstances it was plainly the right of each one to take care of himself, and if he saw fit to buy at the trust sale on the chance of making something, he was free to do so, proyidcd only he took no undue or unfair advantage of his co,owners, and observed the rules concerning fairness at such a sale which prevails in any circumstances. If two or more of those who had been concerned should choose to unite their fortune in a new purchase, there was no principle of law or morals to forbid. That they should agree to buy at the best price obtainable was their right, if they might bvty at all, provided they resorted to no artifice to deter others from bidding. Pewabic Mining Co. -v. Mason, 145 U. S. 349.

OCTOBER TERM, 1909.

Opinion of the Court.

216 U. S.

·Mr. Jeniier's attitude at the sale was that of an open bidder acting in his own interest, and necessarily in opposition to
that of the appellee and other cotenants. There were others pi'esent at the sale bidding against him, and chief among them was tile appellant himself, who, although lie says he intended to give the syndicate the benefit of his purchase, said nothing of it, and seemingly sought to secure himself as best he could in the apparent wreck of the joint enterprise. It was the misfortune of the appellafit that he forced the bidding beyond the maximum price to which Jenner was authorized to go, and then was unable to comply with the terms of the sale. This resulted in an immediate reoffering of the property, as was to be expected. That in this second sale the property was knocked down for much less only shows that the former price had been inflated by the competitioin between these cotenants, each trying to save himself in the same way. That the price at which ,Jenner bought was probably several thousand dollars less than its then cstiinat(ed market value, may be true. But it is also true that the l)'olJcrty was of a speculative character, a.nd at that time and for some tinic later was difficult of sale and much depressed. But this price was not so grossly inadequate as of itself to justify relief, even if the bill had been promptly filed. That sale was in February, 1898. This bill was filed in the sl)rin1g of 1903. That appellant did not at the sale know that Jenner was buying for himself and certain other of the syndicate may be true, but he, confessedly, learned that fact when Jenner and his associates fell out and the fact came to light in a bill filed in December, 1898. At most, the sale was voidable, not void, and lie who would complain must seasonably elect whether he will avoid it or not. Twin Lick Oil Co. v. Marbury, 91. U. S. 587.
Appellant did not act with that degree of promptness which equity demands. He has slumbered over the question of whether he should elect to let Jenner hold on to' his purchase or require him to give the benefit of his bargain to his co-

tenants. A delay of not less than four years, during which there has been'a large appreciation in the value of the property, is unreasonable. Two courts in succession have failed to find ground for relief, and we-see no good reason for reversing the decree from which the appellant has appealed.

WATERMAN v. THE CANAL-LOUISIANA BANK AND TRUST COMPANY, EXECUTOR.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA.
No. 306. Submitted February 25, 1909.-Decided November 8, 1909.
The equity jurisdiction of the Federal courts is derived from the Federal Constitution and statutes and is like unto that of the High Court of Chancery in England at the time of the adoption of the Judiciary Act of 1789; it is not subject to limitations or restraints by state legislation giving jurisdiction to state courts over similar matters.
While Federal courts cannot seize and control property which is in the possession of the state courts and have no jurisdiction of a purely probate character, they can, as courts of chancery, exercise jurisdiction, where proper diversity of citizenship exists, in favor of creditors, legatees, and heirs, to establish their claims and have a proper execution of the trust as to them.
Although complainant in this case asks in some of her prayers for relief which is beyond the jurisdiction of the court as being of a purely probate character if the allegations of the bill support them the court may grant other prayers for relief which are within its jurisdiction, and, as a court of equity, shape its decree according to the equity of the case.
Where the bill does not seek to set aside the probate of a will or interfere with the possession of the probate court, the Federal court of equity, in a case where diverse citizenship exists, may determine as between the parties before the court their interests in the estate and such decree will be binding upon, and may be enforced against, the executor.
It will be assumed that the state probate court will respect the decree

of the Federal court having jurisdiction settling the rights of parties in an estate, and the denial of effect of such a decree presents a claim of Federal right which can be protected by this court. While a Federal court of equity cannot, either under the forty-seventh rule in equity or general principles of equity, proceed to adjudication in the absence of indispensable parties, if it can do justice to the parties before it without injury to absent persons it will do so and shape the decree so as to preserve the rights of those actually before the court, without prejudice to the rights of the absentees. In this case the absent party was not of the same State as complainant and had no interest in common with complainant and while a proper, was not an indispensable party, as his interests were separate and could be protected by retention of his legacy by the executors subject to adjudication in another suit.

THE facts, which involved the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, are stated in the opinion.

Mr. E. Howard M'Caleb, and Mr. E. Howard M'Caleb, Jr., for appellant:
As to the jurisdiction of the Federal court: Any creditor, heir or legatee who is a citizen of another State has the right to institute his suit in the Federal court against executors and administrators and all other parties interested, who are citizens of the same State as decedent, to determine the validity and extent of his rights and claims in the property of the estate; nor is he deprived of his original right to maintain and to try his suit in the Federal court by his failure to present his claim to the state court as provided by the administration statutes of the State. Here are a few of the authorities: Suydam v. Broadnax, 14 Pet. 67; Bank v. Vaiden, 18 How. 503; Borer v. Chapman, 119 U. S. 587, 588, 589; Payne v. Hook, 7 Wall. 425, 430; Lawrence v. Neilson, 143 U. S. 215, 224; Hayes v. Pratt,147 U. S. 557, 570; Hess v. Reynolds, 113 U. S. 73; Hyde v. Stone, 20 How. 170; Byers v. McAuley, 149 U. S. 608; Yonley v. Lavender, 21 Wall. 276; Green v. Creighton, 23 How. 90. To sustain appellees' contention that the state court, hav-

WATERMAN v. CANAL-LOUISIANA BANK CO. 35

Argument for Appellant.

ing acquired jurisdiction over the succession, is alone competent to entertain and determine every issue which may arise in the progress of the cause, whether it be as to the construction of the will, the rights of heirs and legatees to the estate, and the claims of creditors which may be asserted against it, whether such parties be citizens of other States or not, until the administration is terminated, the funds distributed and the executor discharged, would be to deny the judicial power of the United States conferred by the Constitution as extending over "controversies between citizens of different States" and force such citizens into the state courts in order to have their complaints heard. This is answered by Buck v. Colbath, 3 Wall. 334, 347; Watson v. Jones, 13 Wall. 679.
Farrell v. O'Brien, 199 U. S. 89, is claimed to be decisive against the Federal jurisdiction over this bill, but it can be distinguished as in that case the only question was as to the power of the Circuit Court to annul a will admitted to probate. It was held that, where the laws of a State afforded a remedy by contest in proceedings supplementary to the original probate proceedings, such a contest was not inter partes, and hence not within the designation of "a suit at law or in equity." It was further held that, where the construction and effect of the will is wholly subordinate to the sole issue of probate, Federal jurisdiction did not attach under the rule "that no instrument can be effective as a will, no rights in relation to it can arise until preliminary probate has been first made." Ellis v. Davis, 109 U. S. 485. But here there is no contest over the existence or non-existence of the will, and such a question is, therefore, a moot one. In Louisiana, an action to set aside a will already admitted to probate is strictly and purely an independent action in nullity between parties. Unlike the Washington statutes, involved in Farrell v. O'Brien, the judgment setting aside the will only binds the parties, inures only to the benefit of the particular contestant, and is not operative as to the whole world. Ellis v. Davis, 109 U. S. 485; Gaines v. Fuenles, 92 U. S. 10. As to

OCTOBER TERM, 1909.

those not parties, the judgment of probate still stands prima facie valid. Succession of Barker, 10 La. Ann. 28; Compton v. Prescott, 12 Rob. (La.) 56; Ingersoll v. Coram, 211 U. S. 335; Garzot v. DeRubio, 209 U. S. 283, can also be distinguished.
The modes of the action in nullity may be various, but essentially and in its nature it is one inter partes, and if the cause of nullity of a judgment probating a will is not one of form, but one of substance, relating to the merits, then the courts of the United States have jurisdiction where diversity of citizenship exists and state rules on the subject cannot deprive them of it. Barrow v. Hunton, 99 U. S. 80, 85; Arrowsmith v. Gleason, 129 U. S. 86, 98; Johnson v. Waters, 111 U. S. 640, 667. It is, however, out of place to pursue this matter at length, since there is nothing in the case that seeks to set aside the probate of the will. The sole question is: Have the Federal courts jurisdiction to establish a claim or right against and into an estate where the parties are, on one side citizens of one State and on the other citizens of another State? The long line of jurisprudence of this court remains unbroken. The question has been answered in the affirmative.
As to the indispensability of parties: That the right of action for the establishment of his claim, as well as his interest by an heir is separable from that of his co-heirs is the law of Louisiana. Tugwell v. Tugwell, 32 La. Ann. 848; Denbridge v. Crawley, 43 La. Ann. 504; Glasscock v. Clark, 33 La. Ann. 584; Burney Heirs v. Ludeling, 41 La. Ann. 627, 632; Denegre v. Denegre, 33 La. Ann. 689; Skipwith v. Glathary, 34 La. Ann. 28; Arts. 113 and 120, Code of Practice of Louisiana. Even if Louisiana jurisprudence cannot be invoked to control the jurisdiction of the Federal court, sitting in equity, nevertheless it should control the question upon which equity jurisdiction as to parties is founded concerning the character of an heir's interest in the estate as separate from that of his co-heir. At least, it is persuasive, since it fully accords with

equity jurisdiction as to parties. Payne v. Hook, 7 Wall. 425, 433; Story's Equity Pleading, 10th ed., §§ 89, 207a, 212.
The strict rule as to parties will yield if the court can proceed to decree and do justice to the parties before it without injury to the absentees. Cooper's Eq. P1. 35; West v. Randall 2 Massachusetts, 181. In Minnesota v. Northern SecuritiesCo., 184 U. S. 199, 235, this-.court regarded the absent parties as absolutely indispensable to the main cause of action, which is not the case here. See Payne v. Hook, 7 Wall. 425; Van Bokellen v. Cook, Fed. Cas. No. 16,831; Elmendorf v. Taylor, 10 Wheat. 167; Delaware County v. Diebold Safe Co., 133 U. S. 473.
Complainant may be required to waive her allegation as to Davis and still the court has jurisdiction. Northey v. Northey, 2 Arkansas, 77; S. C., 26 Eng. Reprint, 447; Williams v. Williams, 9 Mod. 299; S. C., 88 Eng. Reprint, 465.

The state court acted first, and, under the law of Louisiana, has the entire estate in its possession and its administration, and it is entitled to proceed with that administration until it shall be completed. if complainant's contention is correct, a non-resident creditor of an estate in the hands of a receiver appointed by a state court can file a suit in a Federal court against the state court receiver, and request the Federal court, not only to pass upon the litigated claim, but further to fix the costs and expenses of the state

No precedent for this remarkable action can be found. See Farrell v. O'Brien, 199 U. S. 89, which distinguishes Byers v. McAuley, 149 U. S. 608; Lawrence v. Nelson, 143 U. S. 223; Hayes v. Pratt,147 U. S. 570.

MR. JUSTICE DAY delivered the opinion of the court.

This case presents a question of jurisdiction concerning the right of the United States Circuit Court to entertain a certain bill in equity. Frances E. Waterman, wife of Charles A. Crane, a resident of Chicago in the State of Illinois, and a citizen of that State, joined by her husband, also a citizen of Illinois, brought the suit in the United States Circuit Court against the Canal-Louisiana Bank and Trust Company, executor of the last will and testament of Caroline Stannard Tilton, deceased, a citizen of the State of Louisiana and an inhabitant of the East-

ern District of Louisiana, and also against the Charity Hospital of New Orleans, St. Ann's Asylum, Protestant Episcopal Orphan Asylum, Home for Incurables, Christian Woman's Exchange, State Insane Asylum of Jackson, Louisiana; City of New Orleans and Louisiana Retreat, conducted by the Society of the Daughters of St. Vincent de Paul, all and each of them being institutions established under the laws of Louisiana and citizens of the State of Louisiana, and inhabitants of the Eastern District of Louisiana; also against Robert Waterman and Frederick Waterman, citizens of the State of Louisiana and inhabitants of the Eastern District thereof. The bill set forth in substance: That Caroline Stannard Tilton, widow of Frederick W. Tilton, late of the city of New Orleans, duly made and published her last will and testament and codicils thereunto annexed, and by said will and codicils said Caroline Stannard Tilton gave and bequeathed to Robert Waterman the sum of $3,000; to the said Robert Waterman and his wife, fifteen premium bonds; to Frederick Waterman $3,000; to Frederick Tilton Davis, $1,000, and the whole series of No. 5,963 premium bonds. That the said Caroline Stannard Tilton departed this life on or about the sixth of July, 1908; that the Canal-Louisiana Bank and Trust Company, executor in said will named, duly proved the same in the court of probate jurisdiction in and for the Parish of Orleans in the State of Louisiana, and undertook the executorship thereof, and possessed itself of the personal estate and effects of the said testatrix to a very considerable amount, and more than sufficient to discharge her just debts, funeral expenses and legacies.
The complainant further avers that she is the sole surviving niece, and that Robert and Frederick Waterman and Frederick Tilton Davis are the sole surviving nephews of said Caroline Stannard Tilton, and that there are no other persons within the nearest degree of kinship of the said testatrix; and that the said Frederick Tilton Davis resides in the State of Alabama, outside of the court's jurisdiction.
She avers that the said Robert Waterman, Frederick Water-

man and Frederick Tilton Davis, legatees in said will, became entitled to have and receive their said respective legacies, and did receive the same, and accordingly, by receiving said bequests have renounced the succession of said Caroline Stannard Tilton, deceased, and by taking said legacies have renounced all their rights as heirs at law, and are estopped and debarred from claiming any portion of the estate undisposed of, because of certain provisions of the will, which are set forth in the bill.
It is further averred by the complainant that by reason of the renunciation and estoppel of said legatees the complainant remains the sole heir at law of Caroline Stannard Tilton, and, as
such, is entitled to the shares which would have gone to Frederick and Robert Waterman and Frederick Tilton Davis, of the same degree and collateral line, by right of accretion.
She further avers that said will bequeathed to the Charity Hospital of New Orleans, $2,000; St. Ann's Asylum, $2,000; Protestant Episcopal Orphan Asylum, $2,000; Home for Incurables, $2,000; Home for Insane, $3,000, and to the Christian Woman's Exchange, $1,000; and that after satisfaction of the foregoing special legacies and bequests, and after payment of all costs and expenses of settlement of the estate, if any remained thereof undisposed of, the testatrix willed and directed that such residue should be divided between the beneficiaries of the charitable bequests heretofore made to the various institutions, the divisions to be made pro rata in proportion to the amount of special legacies already made to them, respectively. She avers that at the time of making said will, and at the time of the death of said testatrix, there was no such institution or corporation in existence known as Home for Insane, nor was the testatrix capable of incorporating any such institution under her will; and that said special legacy for $3,000, and the pro rata share of the residue remained undisposed of because of the facts stated, and thereby the sum of $3,000 and the pro rata share of the proportion of the estate undisposed of devolved upon the complainant as sole legal heir and next of kin to said Caroline Stannard Tilton. And it was averred that

WATERMAN v. CANAL-LOUISIANA BANK CO. 41

215 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

the Christian Woman's Exchange was not entitled to share in the residue, because the bequest to it of $1,000 was not a charitable bequest, and the said Christian Woman's Exchange was not one of the institutions mentioned in the will to share in the residue.
Complainant states that the insane asylum situated at Jackson, Louisiana, the Louisiana Retreat, conducted by the Society of the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul, and the city of New Orleans claim and assert their right to take and receive the amount of said lapsed and caducous legacies, asserting that the testatrix intended them as beneficiaries of her bounty, and as particular legacies under her will, instead of the Home for Insane. And the plaintiff denies, for reasons stated in the bill, that either of them is entitled to receive such legacies intended for the Home for Insane, and she charges that the amount falling to her as sole legal heir and next of kin, because of her right to the lapsed legacies bequeathed to the non-existing Home for Insane's share in the residue, together with that part and proportion of the estate accessory and appurtenant thereto, exceeds the sum of $90,000, which she is entitled to out of the estate. She charges that the estate, after payment of the special legacies, charges and costs of administration, will amount to more than a residue of $350,000. She charges that the executor refuses to do or make any satisfaction whatever in respect to her just demands, and the complainant avers that she has no sufficient remedy under the rules of common law, and must resort to a court of equity for adequate relief. And the prayer of the bill is:
"Wherefore, your oratrix prays that this court do order, adjudge and decree (1) that the particular legacy contained in the last will and testament of Caroline Stannard Tilton, deceased, to so-called 'Home for Insane,' and also the interest of said legatee in the residue or residuum of said testatrix's estate, be declared caducous, to have lapsed, because of the uncertainty and non-existence of said legatee; (2) that it be further declared and decreed that Robert Waterman and Fred-

erick Waterman have renounced and abandoned all their right, title and interest as heirs of said Caroline Stannard Tilton, deceased, in the said lapsed and caducous legacy made in favor of the so-called 'Home for Insane;' (3) that it be further adjudged and decreed that your oratrix, as the nearest sole heir and next of kin of said Caroline Stannard Tilton, deceased, capable of inheriting, is alone entitled to the amount of the caducous and lapsed special legacy bequeathed to the said socalled 'Home for Insane,' for the sum of three thousand dollars ($3,000.00), and to the proportionate share of said non-existing and uncertain legatee in the residue of the estate of said Caroline Stannard Tilton, and that the Canal-Louisiana Bank & Trust Company, executor of said deceased, Caroline Stannard Tilton, be condemned to pay over and deliver to your oratrix the whole amount of said caducous, special legacy, together with the proportionate share and interest of said so-called 'Home for Insane' in the residue of the estate of said deceased remaining after the payment of the particular legacies and the costs of administration of her estate, and for such further sum as the court may find to be justly due and owing unto your oratrix as legal heir and next of kin of the said Caroline Stannard Tilton; (4) and that it be further ordered and decreed that the Christian Woman's Exchange is not a charitable institution or entitled as such under said will to participate or receive any share or portion of the residue of the estate of said deceased; (5) and that an account be taken of the personal estate and effects of the said testatrix coming to the hands of the said executor, or of any person or persons by its order or for its use, and also of the said testatrix's funeral expenses, debts, legacies and costs of administration, and especially showing the residue remaining in the hands of the said executor after making the aforesaid deduction, and that the same may be applied in due course of administration, and that for these purposes proper directions may be given.
"And your oratrix further prays for all general and equitable relief, as well as all costs."

WATERMAN v. CANAL-LOUISIANA BANK CO. 43

215 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

From an early period in the history of this court cases have arisen requiring a consideration and determination of the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States to entertain suits against administrators and executors for the purpose of establishing claims against estates, and to have a determination of the rights of persons claiming an interest therein. And this court has had occasion to consider how far the jurisdiction in equity of the courts of the United States in such matters may be affected by the statutes of the States providing for courts of probate for the establishment of wills and the settlement of estates. We will not stop to analyze or review in detail all these cases, as they have been the subject of frequent and recent consideration in this court. The general rule to be deduced from them is that, inasmuch as the jurisdiction 'of the courts of the United States is derived from the Federal Constitution and statutes, that in so far as controversies between citizens of different States arise which are within the established equity jurisdiction of the Federal courts, which is like unto the High Court of Chancery in England at the time of the adoption of the Judiciary Act of 1789, the jurisdiction may be exercised, and is not subject to limitations or restraint by state legislation establishing courts of probate and giving them jurisdiction over similar matters. This court has uniformly maintained the right of Federal courts of chancery to exercise original jurisdiction (the proper diversity of citizenship existing) in favor of creditors, legatees and heirs to establish their claims and have a proper execution of the trust as to them. In various forms these principles have been asserted in the following, among other cases: Suydam v. Broadnax, 14 Pet. 67; Hyde et al. v. Stone, 20 How. 170, 175; Green's Ad. v. Creightonet al., 23 How. 90; Payne v. Hook, 7 Wall. 425; Lawrence v. Nelson, 143 U. S. 215; Hayes v. Pratt,147 U. S. 557, 570; Byers v. McAuley, 149 U. S. 608; Ingersoll v. Coram, 211 U. S. 335.
The rule stated in many cases in this court affirms the jurisdiction of the Federal courts to give relief. of the nature stated,

OCTOBER TERM, 1909.

Opinion of the Court.

215 U. S.

notwithstanding the statutes of the State undertake to give to state probate courts exclusive jurisdiction over all matters concerning the settlement of accounts of executors and administrators in the distribution of estates. This rule is subject to certain qualifications, which we may now notice. The courts of the United States, while they may exercise the jurisdiction, and may make decrees binding upon the parties, cannot seize and control the property which is in the possession of the state court. In Byers v. McAuley, supra, the rule was thus tersely stated by Mr. Justice Brewer, delivering the opinion of the court:
"A citizen of another State may establish a debt against the estate. Yonley v. Lavender, 21 Wall. 276; Hess v. Reynolds,.113 U. S. 73. But the debt thus established must take its place and share of the estate as administered by the probate court; and it cannot be enforced by process directly against the property of the decedent. I'onley v. Lavender, supra. In like manner a distributee, citizen of another State, may establish his right to a share in the estate, and enforce such adjudication against the administrator personally, or his sureties (Payne v. Hook, 7 Wall. 425); or against any other parties subject to liability (Borer v. Chapman, 119 U. S. 587), or in other way which does not disturb the-possession of the property by the state court. (See the many cases heretofore cited.)"
In a late case, where the subject was given consideration in this court (Farrellv. O'Brien, 199 U. S. 89) while the rule of the earlier cases was stated and their binding force admitted, it was laid down that the Circuit Court of the United States could not entertain jurisdiction of a bill to set aside the probate of a will in the State of Washington, because by the statutes of that State the proceeding was one purely in rem and not a suit inter partes, sustainable in a court of equity. That case recognized what previous cases had held, that in proceedings purely of a probate character there was no jurisdiction in the Federal courts. This was in harmony with the rule

WATERMAN v. CANAL-LOUISIANA BANK CO. 45

215 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

theretofore laid down in Byers v. McAuley, supra, in which it was held that the Federal court could not exercise original jurisdiction to draw to itself the entire settlement of the estate of the decedent and the accounts of administration, or the power to determine all claims against the estate. But it was there decided that a Circuit Court of the United States could entertain jurisdiction in favor of citizens of other States to determine and award by decrees binding in personam their shares in the estates.
In view of the cases cited, and the rules thus established, it is evident that the bill in this case goes too far in asking to have an accounting of the estate, such as can only be had in the probate court having jurisdiction of the matter; for it is the result of the cases that in so far as the probate administration of the estate is concerned in the payment of debts, and the settlement of the accounts by the executor or administrator, the jurisdiction of the probate court may not be interfered with. It is also true, as was held in the court below in the case at bar, that the prior possession of the state probate court cannot be interfered with by the decree of the Federal court. Still, we think there is an aspect of this case within the Federal jurisdiction, and for which relief may be granted to the complainant, if she makes out the allegations of her bill under the other prayers, and the prayer for general relief therein contained. Under such prayer a court of equity will shape its decree according to the equity of the case. Walden v. Bodley, 14 Pet. 156, 164.
The complainant, a citizen of a different State, brings her bill against the executor and certain legatees named, who are likewise citizens of another State, and are all citizens of Louisiana, where the bill was filed, except one, who was beyond the jurisdiction of the court, and for the reasons stated in her bill she asks to have her interest in the legacy alleged to be lapsed and the residuary portion of the estate established.
This controversy is within the equity jurisdiction of the courts of the United States as heretofore recognized in this

OCTOBER TERM, 1909.

Opinion of the Court.

215 U. S.

court, and such jurisdiction cannot be limited or in anywise curtailed by state legislation as to its own courts. The complainant, it is to be noted, does not seek to set aside the probate of the will which the bill alleges was duly established and admitted to probate in the proper court of the State.
The United States Circuit Court, by granting this relief, need not interfere with the ordinary settlement of the estate, the payment of the debts and special legacies, and the deterrmination of the accounts of funds in the hands of the executor,
but it may, and we think has the right to determine as between the parties before the court the interest of the complainant in the alleged lapsed legacy and residuary estate, because of the facts presented in the bill. The decree to be granted cannot interfere with the possession of the estate in the hands of the executor, while being administered in the probate court, but it will be binding upon the executor, and may be enforced against it personally. If the Federal court finds that the complainant is entitled to the alleged lapsed legacy and the residue of the estate, while it cannot interfere with the probate court in determining the amount of the residue arising from the settlement of the estate in the court of probate, the decree can find the amount of the residue, as determined by the administration in the probate court in the hands of the executor, to belong to the complainant, and to be held in trust for her, thus binding the executor personally, as was the case in Payne v. Hook, 7 Wall. 425, supra, and Ingersoll v. Coram, 211 U. S. 335, supra.
It is to be presumed that the probate court will respect any adjudication which might be made in settling the rights of parties in this suit in the Federal court. It has been frequently held in this court that a judgment of a Federal court awarding property or rights, when set up in a state court, if its effect is denied, presents a claim of Federal right which may be protected in this court.
The Circuit Court in this case construed the bill, in view of its broad prayer for relief, as one which undertook to take the

WATERMAN v. CANAL-LOUISIANA BANK CO. 47

215 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

entire settlement of the estate from the hands of the probate court, and denied the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of the United States in the premises. We are of opinion that, to the extent stated, the bill set up a valid ground for relief, and, while all that it asks cannot be granted, enough was stated in it to make a case within the jurisdiction of the Federal courts within the principles we have stated.
At the last term of the court counsel in this case were invited to file, on or before the first day of the present term of court, briefs upon the question whether Frederick Tilton Davis, averred in the bill to be a resident of the State of Alabama and outside of the jurisdiction of the court, is an indispensable party to the suit, and in his absence a dismissal of the cause required for want of jurisdiction in the court to proceed without him. These briefs have been filed and we come now to consider this branch of the case. In so doing it is essential to remember that the complainant's cause of action is primarily against the executor of the estate for a decree against it concerning the right of the complainant to recover because of the alleged lapse of the legacy to the Home for the Insane, and the consequent increase in the residuary portion of the estate to be distributed to the heirs of Mrs. Tilton because of the allegations contained in the bill. The Watermans and Davis are made parties to the bill, and asked to be excluded from a participation in the recovery because of the alleged renunciation of their rights in the succession to Mrs. Tilton. If it shall be found that they have not thus renounced their interest, and a decree be rendered in complainant's favor, they are entitled to participate in the recovery. They have no interest in common, however, with the complainant, and the shares of the complainant and other heirs are separate and distinct. The question is, therefore, Is Davis an indispensable party to this suit, his absence creating a want of jurisdiction in the Federal court to proceed without him?
Section 737 of the Revised Statutes of the United States provides:

OCTOI3EIR TERM, 1909.

Opinion of the Court.

215 U. S.

"When there are several defendants in any suit at law or in equity, and one or more of them are neither inhabitants of nor found within the district in which the suit is brought, and do not voluntarily appear, the court may entertain jurisdiction, and proceed to the trial and adjudication of the suit between the parties who are properly before it; but the judgment or decree rendered therein shall not conclude or prejudice other parties not regularly served with process nor voluntarily appearingto answer."
To the same effect is the forty-seventh equity rule. This statute and rule permit the court to proceed with the trial and adjudication of the suit, as between parties who are properly before it, and preserves the rights of parties not voluntarily appearing, providing their rights are not prejudiced by the decree to be rendered in the case. This rule has been said to be declaratory of the already-established equity practice. Shields v. Barrow, 1.7How. 130; 1 Street's Federal Equity Practice,
§533, and cases there cited. This rule does not permit a
Federal court to proceed to a decree in that class of cases in which there is an absence of indispensable, as distinguished from proper, or even necessary parties, for neither the absence of formal, or such as are commonly termed necessary parties, will defeat the jurisdiction of the court; provided, in the case of necessary parties, their interests are such and so far separable from those of parties before the court, that the decree can be so shaped that the rights of those actually before the court may be determined without necessarily affecting other persons not within the jurisdiction. After pointing out that there may be formal parties, of whose omission the court takes no account, Mr. Justice Miller, in delivering the opinion in Barney v. Baltimore, 6 Wall. 280, went on to say:
"There is another class of persons whose relations to the suit are such that if their interest and their absence are formally brought to the attention of the court, it will require 'them to be made parties, if within its jurisdiction, before deciding the case. But if this cannot be done, it will proceed to

WATERMAN v. CkNAL-LOUISIANA BANK CO. 49

215 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

administer such relief as may be in its power between the parties before it. And there is a third class whose interests in the subject-matter of the suit and in the relief sought are so bound up with that of the other parties that their legal presence as parties to the proceeding is an absolute necessity, without which the court cannot proceed. In such cases the court refuses to entertain the suit when these parties cannot be subjected to its jurisdiction."
The relation of an indispensable party to the suit must be such that no decree can be entered in the case which will do justice between the parties actually before the court without injuriously affecting the rights of such absent party. 1 Street's Fed. Equity Practice, § 519.
If the court can do justice to the parties before it without injuring absent persons it will do so, and shape its relief in such a manner as to preserve the rights of the persons not before the court. If necessary, the court may require that the bill be dismissed as to such absent parties, and may generally shape its decrees so as to do justice to those made parties, without prejudice to such absent persons. Payne v. Hook, 7 Wall. 425.
Applying these principles to the case at bar we are of opinion that the presence of Frederick T. Davis as a party to the suit is not essential to the jurisdiction of the Federal court to proceed to determine the case as to the parties actually before it. In other words, that while Davis is a necessary party in the sense that he has an interest in the controversy, his interest is not that of an indispensable party Without whose presence a court of equity cannot do justice between the parties before it, and whose interest must be so affected by any decree to be rendered as to oust the jurisdiction of the court.
With the parties before it the court may proceed to determine whether, because of the acts alleged in the bill, the heirsat-law of Mrs. Tilton were entitled to recover because of the lapsed legacy. If it finds the issue in favor of the complainant, it may proceed to determine the proportion in which the com-

plainant and the Watermans are entitled to share, without prejudice to the rights of Davis. It may direct the retention of his share in the hands of the executors, to be adjudicated in some other suit, or may otherwise shape its relief so as to do justice to the parties before the court without affecting his interest.
Upon the whole case we are of opinion that the Federal court has jurisdiction for the purpose of ascertaining the rights of the complainant to recover as against the executor, and the interest of the persons before the court in the fund. While the court could make no decree which would interfere with the possession of the probate court, it had jurisdiction to entertain the bill and to render a judgment binding upon the parties to the extent and in the manner which we have already stated. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the court below erred in holding that there was no jurisdiction to entertain this suit, and the decree is reversed and the cause remanded to the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Louisiana for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.

MR. JUSTICE HoLAI ES dclivered the opinion of "the court.

These are cross-appeals in a proceeding )rought by Monserrate and Dominga Garcia, two sisters of Manuel Garcia Maytin, and by another plaintiff now dropped out, to establish their rights in property descended from the said Manuel Garcia. The claim is founded upon Article 811 of the former Civil Code, of which the following is the War Department translation: "The ascendant who inherits property from his descendant, acquired by the latter for a good consideration from another descendant [ascendant] or from a brother or sister, is obliged to reserve the property he may have acquired by force of law in favor of the relatives within the third degree belonging to the line from which such property originated."
The following is the course of the property concerned: 1. Complainants' brother, Manuel Garcia Maytin. Died intestate in 1886, succeeded by 2. His daughter, Mrs. Beatriz Garcia de Ibarra, as sole heir. Died intestate and without descendants 1891, suc-
ceeded by 3. Her mother, Mrs. Beatriz Al6s, widow of Manuel Garcia
Maytin, as sole heir. Died, 1904, leaving a will, devising to

4. Her mother, Beatriz de los Angeles, and nephews and nieces, who with Vela, the executor of the will, and with purchasers from Mrs. Beatriz Al6s, are the defendants.
It will be seen that (3) Mrs. Beatriz Al6s was an ascendant who inherited from her descendant (2), Mirs. Beatriz Garcia, propert.y accljiired by the latter from the ascendant (1), her father. Therefore the devisees of Mrs. Beatriz Alds would be postponed by the law just quoted in favor of the relatives within the third degree, who are the two sisters bringing this
complaint. The Supreme Court of Porto Rico, in a very lucid and
persuasive opinion, established the position of the plaintiffs and answered the objections urged by the defense. It was shown that as Mrs. Beatriz Al6s (3) inherited all-the property of her daughter (2) as sole heir, notwithstanding the fact that the husband of the latter had the usufruct of one-third for life, the obligation extended to all the property so inherited, being the same property that the daughter had inherited from her father, she not appearing to have had any other estate, with insignificant exceptions. 'Itwas shown further that the obligation of Mrs. Beatriz A16s and Mrs. Beatriz de los Angeles was not affected by the failure of the plaintiffs and others to make it appar in the registry that the property was subject to be reserved. Mortgage Law, Art. 199. That section was not the source of the plaintiffs' rights, but only a means of securing them against bona fide purchasers. It did not extinguish their rights as against the relatives under Art. 811 of the Civil Code, in case of neglect. Finally, a satisfactory answer was given to the argument that the plaintiffs were barred by prescription, under an order of the military government of Porto Rico, published on April 4, 1899, by which the Civil Code, Art. 1957, was amended so that ownership should prescribe by possession for Zsix years with good faith and' a proper title. The daughter died in 1891, and her mother recorded her title in the registry and held from 1891 to her death in 1904. But it was replied that

GARCIA v. VELA.

216 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

in the first place prescription had not been pleaded, and was not open, and, secondly, that Article 1957, and therefore the amendment, referring to prescription to acquire ownership, coexists with Art. 1963, which fixes a term of thirty years for the prescription by which ownership of real property is lost through a failure to bring a real action, and that in this case the prescription relied upon (and, we may add, probably the only one that could have been relied upon) was that resulting from the plaintiffs not having sued.
For these reasons the Supreme Court affirmed a judgment of the District Court, condemning the defendants to deliver to the plaintiffs certain specified land, or, where the same had been sold, the value of the same, to be ascertained by appraisement, with the costs in the District Court. The defendant, Mrs. Beatriz de los Angeles, appealed, her appeal being number 245 in this court, but as the other defendants did not join in the appeal, and there was no summons and severance, not to speak of other possible objections, the ap-. peal must be dismissed. Iardee v. Wilson, 146 U. S. 179. We therefore go no farther on this part of the case than to give the foregoing brief summary of an argument from which we see no reason to dissent.
The plaintiffs also appeal and this makes it necessary to mention one or two facts not noticed thus far. On the death of Manuel Garcia, his widow, in the course of proceedings for the settlement of his estate, filed what seems to have been called a petition for partition, admitting however that there were no properties belonging to th' conjugal partnership. An auditor was appointed and he prepared /schedules of assets and liabilities, of the portion of assets distributedjto the widow for the payment of such liabilities, and of the remainder awarded to the daughter and sole heir; this last consisting of two parcels of land and some personalty of small value. Thereupon the partition was ciosed. The judgment appealed from gave the plaintiffs only the land inherited by the mother from the -daughter and included in the last-

216 TT. S.

mentioned schedule. The plaintiffs set up that the partition proceedings were void upon their face for several reasons and that they therefore are entitled to all the property that Manuel Garcia left.
The local courts answered this claim by saying that if there were otherwise any foundation for it, it is barred by the limitation of four years set to rescissory actions and actions for nullity by Arts. 1076 and 1301 of the Civil Code. For in the first place neither the daughter nor her husband, Mr. Ibarra, ev(ir took any steps to set the partition aside, and it is plausible to say that the plaintiffs claim by inheritance from her, since if she had left descendants the property would have gone from her to them. Hence, not·withstanding the daughter's inability to cut the plaintiffs off in the event that happened, it is questionable at least whether they are not barred by what barred her. In the next place, the plaintiffs took no steps after the daughter's death, during the whole lifetime and occupation of her mother from 1891 to 1904. Even if, as the plaintiffs say, their right would have been divested by their death during the life of the mother, Mrs. Beatriz Al6s, (3), it seems to have vested at the death of the daughter, Mrs. Beatriz Garcia (2). We are not prel)ared to overthrow the assumption made by the court, whose experhrnce in such questions is entitled to much consideratioji, Armijo v. Armijo, 181 U. S. 558, 561, Albright v. Sandoval, Feb. 21, 1910, ante, 1. 331, that the plaintiffs had a sufficient interest to entitle them to bring an action to set aside'the so-called partition on the daughter's death, and that on their failing to do so the right to dispute the same was barred by lapse of time.
If the partition stands the other questions argued, as to purchasers from the mother, Mrs. Beatriz Albs, etc., need no further answer. We deem it proper to add one remark. Article 811 created the right by 'Which the plaintiffs recover. It did not go into effect until after the death of Manuel Garcia, so that it would seemi to have been Oieni to argument that

But as it did go into effect before the daughter's death, and as. it has been assumed on all hands that that moment was the decisive one, we have made the same assumption under the, circumstances and for the purposes of this case.

No. 108. Argued January 26, 1910.-Decided February 28, 1910.
A decree of the Circuit Court sustaining a deniurrer to a complaint 1praying that an assessment for construction of a street be declared, void as depriving plaintiff of his property without due process of law, affirmed by a divided court without opinion.
THE brief of the appellee contains the following statement: This is a bill in equity. The Parties to the suit, plaintiff and defendants, are all residents of Missouri and of the same judicial district in that State. The subject-matter of the suit is the contention on the part of the .plaintiff that the two special tax bills described in the complaint, issued against his property, by the public authorities of St. Louis under the charter of that city, as a local assessment for the,construction of a street, are void. The tax bills are claimed to be void for one of two reasons, stated in tioallternative, namely, first, because the assessment district, as formed, and which incli(les the plaintiff's l)roperty, is not in (onformity to the charter

No. 63. Submitted December 10, 1909.-Decided March 14, 1910.

Findings of the lower court will not, where another construction is possible, be so construed as to cause them to be silent on an issue so controlling that-the cause could not have been decided on the merits without a finding thereon.
Where findings are so irresponsive to the case made by the pleadings and the facts as to be no findings at all this court must affirm on account of absence of any findings to review. Gray v. Smith, 108 U. S. 12.
A finding that the evidence does not entitle the plaintiff to a decree that the conveyance attacked was made to hinder and delay creditors construed in this case to mean that there had been a failure of proof and that the judgment did not rcst on a conclusion of law that the local law did not afford a remedy if the plaintiff had proved his case.
Under the law of Porto Rico contracts made by an insolvent debtor which are not fraudulent simulations are not susceptible of rescission merely because they operate to prefer a creditor.

No brief was filed for appellees.

MR. JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the court.

This appeal is taken to secure the reversal of a decree of the court below dismissing the bill of complaint. The court sustained its action by an elaborate opinion, and subsequently stated, in a formal way, its findings of fact and conclusions of law.
The evidence is not in the record, although a portion of the testimony is contained in the formal findings of fact, upon the theory that this was-necessary to preserve the right to review the action of the court concerning objection urged by the defendants to the admission of certain testimony tendered on behalf of the c )mplainants. The record, we are constrained to say, is unsatisfactory and confused, a condition which we ass'ime has resulted from circumstances referred to by the court below in the opening passage of its opinion, as follows (3 Porto Rico, 125, 126):
"This is a creditors' bill filed June 23, 1902, and permitted to remain on the docket of this court during the five years
that have since intervened, without any apparent proper or sufficient cause for the unwarranted delay and with infinite inconvenience to many parties connected with the subject-

matter of the controversy. The first two years and a half of the time seem to have been'taken up with- a battle over the proceedings, tryir.g to get the answers of the several respondents settled, and during which time complainants' exceptions to several of the answers were referred to a master, arguments had before him, his report filed, exceptions to the same presented, .arguments had on the latter and briefs submitted in support thereof, and so on, in an interminable and fruitless contest of .)ctitions, motions, exceptions, pleas, demurrers, orders, affidavits and rules to show cause, without result or real merit as we see it. The next year and a half seem to have been taken up somewhat in the same 'way, and also partly in an application for a receivership and in opposing efforts to the same, and in efforts to prevent outside parties from foreclosing several mortgages they had on some of the premises involved, that they had secured in the meantime, in enjoining them from so proceeding and in issuing rules as for contempts against them for their actions in that behalf, etc." arisIne order to in some measure dispel the obscurity which must
from the circumstances just referred to we briefly state,
in 'their chronological order, certain unquestioned facts which gave rise to the controversy, and also outline the pleadings and proceedings, the whole for the pturpose of enabling us to adequately test the sufficiency of tht errors assigned.
For many years the firm of J. Tornabells & Co., composed of Joaquin Tornabeils. and Carlos Doitteau, was established in Porto Rico and there carried on a mercantile business. The firm was the owner -of various trading establishments and warehouses, and was, besides, the owner of considerable real estate, embraced in which were extensive coffee plantations which the firm carried on, including the building., machinery and appurtenances incipient thereto. It is not disputed that, presumably its the result of losses occasionec by a disastrous hurricane which devastated the island of Porto Rico the firm, prior to 1900, had become temporarily embarrassed, andi under.provi.;ions fthe local law, had obtained in a local court

an extension of time for the payment of its debts. While we state the fact as to the suspension we shall nevertheless indulge in the assumption that such fact has no matetial bearing upon the questions here to be decided. We do this because no rights based upon such fact were asserted in thebill of complaint or passed upon by the court, and no right of such a character is asserted in the assignments of error or referred to in the elaborate argument filed on behalf of the appellants, the appellees not having appeared in this court either orally or by brief.
On Mav 9, 1900, Tornabells & Co., by deed before a notary
public, conveyed to Luis Aran y Lanci the following property, as stated by the court below: "Its place of business and other town property, its stock of merchandise and twenty-six several pieces of real estate, most of them being coffee plantations and their appurtenances." The stated price was 197,700
pesos, provincial money, 30,000 declared to have been paid in cash, and the remainder to be paid in ten installments of 16,700 pesos, bearing no interest, maturing respectively from one to ten years. A few days thereafter, on May 11, 1900, Aran y Lanci mortgaged for 150,000 pesos nineteen of the twenty-six pieces of real estate thus conveyed to him. This mortgage was in favor of one Baudelio Duran y Cat and a firm styled Duran & Coll. The mortgage in favor of the first was for 130,000 pesos, divided into ten annual installments of 13,000 pesos each, evidenced by notes to the order of the mortgagee, maturing in each of the ten years, the whole being secured on fourteen of the twenty-six pieces of real estate. The mortgage in favor of Duran & Coll was on five of the pieces of real estate acquired as aforesaid, and secured twenty thousand pesos, divided into five installments of four thousand pesos each, maturing in each of five years. These mortgages were not indivisible, as the amount of each was apportioned among the varous pieces of real estate, so that each piece was liable only for the sum secured on it. .The sale to Aran y Lanci was recorded on May 21, and the mnortgages just stated

on May 24, 1900. On June 25, 1900, the mortgage for 20,000 pesos, which had been executed in its favor by Aran y Lanci, was assigned by the. firm of Duran & Col to Raimundo Valdecillo to secure an indebtedness due him by the firm of 6,000 pesos proincial money, and this assignment was duly registered on July 5, 1900. Sixteen months after the conveyance to Aran y Lanci-that is, on September 16, 1901-the firm of Tornabells & Co. acknowledged by notarial act that Aran y Lanci had by. anticipation fully paid the deferred purchase price (167,700 pesos). Nine months after such acknowledgment Aran y. Lanci mortgaged in favor of the Banco de Solleir to secure 32,780 pesetas, Spanish money., one 6f the pieces of property previously mortgaged to Duran y Cat. On July 5, 1902, this mortgage was put upon record. A few days-after it was so' pul upon record, viz., on June 23, 1902, the suit before us was commenced.
The bill-which was not 'sworn td--was originally filed on behalf of three commercial firms, Will & Co. of Cuba, David Midgley & Sons of Manchester, England, and Ramon Cortado & Co. of Ponce, Porto Rico, and the members of said firms, in their own behalf and in behalf of all others similarly situated who might intervene in the cause. It was alleged that the complainants were creditors of the firm of Tornabells & Co. at the time of the conveyance to Aran y Lanci and.the execution of the mortgages by Aran y Lanci above recited, and that subsequent to said transactions the claims of the complainants had been merged into judgments against the firm, obtained in the court where the bill was filed, and that on such judgments executions had issued and been returned unsatisfied. It 'Was further alleged that the conveyance made by Torna ells & Co. to Aran'y Lanci, and the mortgages put by the latter upon the property ii favor of Duran y Cat, and the firm of Duran & Coll, were fraudulent simulations, and that the property covered by the conveyance and the mortgages cofntinued to belong to the firm; and was held by Aran .y Lanci under a ecret trust in favot. of Tornabells & Co., the con-

veyance and mortgages being mere fictitious devices adopted

between the parties for the purpose of screening the property

from creditors or hindering and delaying them in the recovery

of their claims. It was further charged that at the time of

the transactions referred to Tornabells & Co. was insolvent,

that the alleged price mentioned in the conveyance to Aran

y Lanci was largely below the real value of the property, and

that, despite the alleged conveyance and mortgages, the firm

of Tomabells & Co. continued to control the property con-

veyed and enjoy the fruits thereof. The prayer of the bill in

substance was that a receiver of the property might be ap-

pointed, that the conveyance and subsequent mortgages and

transfers should be declared to be fraudulent and void and

be vacated and annulled, and that the property and each and

every parcel thereof should be decreed to be subject to the

lien of the several judgments. Tornabells and Doitteau, the

members of that firm, Aran y Lanci, Duran y Cat, and Duran

& Coll, and the members of that firm, were made defendants

to the bill. Valdecillo, to whom the mortgage executed by

Aran y Lanci in .favor of Duran & Coil had been assigned,

was also joined as defendant, he being called upon to establish

the verity of his alleged lien. Alfredo Saliva, who was alleged

to. be. the attorney in fact of and to have acted for Aran y

Lanci in the transactions set out in the bill, was also made a

defendant.

Separate sworn answerswdre filed on behalf of the members

of the firm of Tornabells & Co., traversing the allegations of

insolvency and of simulation and fraud, both as respected the

conveyance to Aran y Lanci axid the mortgages executed by

the latter. The answers co. t:.iLed affirinative allegations as

substantially of like tenor, also sworn to was filed on behalf of Aran y Lanci. Juan Coll, a partner in the firm of Duran & Coll, also answered, and averred the bona fides of the mortgage executed by Aran y Lanci to his firm and the transfer thereof made to Valdecillo.
On October 31, 1904, the firm of L. W. & P. Armstrong of New York City,,. unsecured creditors of Tornabells & Co., were made parties complainant to the bill. Thereafter, Ruffer & Sons, a firm doing business in London, England, and the Caja de Ahorros de Mayaguez, a Porto Rican corporation, as creditors of Tornabells & Co., were also allowed to intervene and become parties complainant.
Early in 1905 Tornabells died and the cause was revived as to him against his widow and children as his heirs. In November of the same year Aran y Lanci died, and the cause was revived against his widow, as administratrix of his estate. Doitteau, the surviving partner of Tornabells &.Co., died on January 22, 1907, and the cause was revived against his widow and children.
Duran y Cat, an original defendant to the bill-in whose favor, as we have stated, Aran y Laned had mortgaged fourteen of the pieces of real estate for 130,000 pesos--was not served with process and did not enter his appearance. He also died during the pendency of the cause. On February 12, 1907, upon motion of the complainants, an order was entered dismissing the cause as to the heirs of said Duran y Cat, ".on the ground that said heirs, being out of the jurisdiction
and having entirely disposed of their interest in the cause, are not indispensable parties thereto."
Journal entries are contained in the record, showing that more than a dozen firms or individuals became additional
defendants in the cause. The time when they came in and the nature of the pleadings by them filed or the proceedings had concerning their rights do not distinctly appear. It is, however, fairly inferable that these new defendants came in long after the commencement of the suit, either during or

54

subsequent to the dilatory and confused proeeedings referred to by the court in the excerpt heretofore made from its opinion, and that such defendants asserted rights claimed to have been acquired, after the filing of the bill, in the property affected by the suit, either as purchasers or as holders of mortgage notes. In this connection it is to be observed that neither when the suit was commenced nor at any time during its progress was the court requested by the complainants to award a cautionary notice, to be placed upon. the public records, as a means of warning to parties who might deal with the property in controversy, thus preserving against them, pendente lite, the rights which might be ultimately established as existing in the complainants, and which would not have been preserved by the mere pendency of the suit, unaccompanied with the allowance and registry of the statutory cautionary notice.
Answers or amended answers were filed on behalf of the widow and administratrix of Tornabells, and by the guardian ad litem who was appointed for his minor 'children. An answer was also filed on behalf of the widow and administratrix and minor children of Doitteau. This also was the case as to the widow and administratrix of Aran y Lanci. These various apswers were substantially in accord with those which hiad been previously filed on behalf of the original defendants, except that in one of them the prescription of one year was pleaded. It is inferable from the record that at this stage of the proceedings, or at all events at a time not earlier than four years after the commencement of the suit, certain persons who had acquired rights in or to the property, either directly from Aran y Lanci or through the mortgage executed in favor of Duran y Cat and Duran & CoIl, sought to enforce their claims ahd were enjoined from so doing. At about the same time a receiver was appointed. The record is silent, however, as to whether the receivership was intended to apply to all the property in controversy or whether the receiver attempted to take possession under his appointment, although it would seem that to some extent he did so, since by the

final decree the receiver was ordered to settle his accounts, etc.
It came at last to pass in the spring of 1907 that the cause was heard and taken under advisement. It was disposed of in the summer of that year by the entry of a final decree dismissing the bill, and was followed nearly six months thereafter, on December 19, 1907. by the making of formal findings of. fact and conclusions of law applicable thereto.
The fact ound are embraced in fourteen numbered paragraphs. The tirst merely states in general terms the filing of
the bill, makes allusion to the complicated proceedings which followed, the dismissal as to some of the defendants (presumably the heirs of Duran y Cat), the coming in of other paries, the ultimate joinder of issue and the submission of the cause. In the second is stated the fact that evidence was heard on behalf of the complainants and the submission of a motion for a decree dismissing the bill on two grounds, viz., the failure to prove the allegations of the bill and the prescription of one year. The third finding is as follows:
"3. The documentary evidence introduced on behalf of complainants and the testimony of all the witnesses do not prove the allegations of the bill so as to entitle the complainants to a decree in their favor declaring the conveyance from defendants Tornabells & Co. to defendant Aran, and the mortgage from defendant Aran to defendants Duran y Coll and Duran personally to be voluntary or made to hinder and delay the complainants in the collection of their debts."
The fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth paragraphs, in a summary way, find substantially, as we have stated them, the facts concerning the conveyance by Tornabells & Co. to Aran y Lanci, the execution of the mortgages in favor of Duran y Cat and Duran & Coil, and the divisibility of those mortgages, as well as the fact that the claims upon which the complainants sued, although in existence, were not reduced to judg, !nt until some time after the execution of the conveyance and mortgages in question. In

OCTOBER TERM. 1909.

one of the paragraphs it is stated that the property conveyed by Tornabells & Co. was substantially all that was owned by the firm at the time of the conveyance, and that Duran y Cat was a relative of the senior member of Tornabells & Co. By the tenth paragraph it is found that the mortgage asserted by the Banco de Sollier was one which Aran y Lani had executed in favor of that bank on one of the properties acquired by him from Tornabells & Co., and was given to secure a debt due by that firm to the bank, that Aran y Lanci incurred no personal responsibility, and that he produced, as paid, the mortgage note identified with the act of mortgage executed in favdr of Duran y Cat, which had been released or extinguished so far as the particular property was concerned. The eleventh paragraph stated that the mortgage asered by the firm of Fritze, Lundt & Co., on.one of the pieces of property conveyed to Aran y Lanci, was executed by the latter in favor of Fritze, Lundt &.Co. to secure the payment of a current account for supplies furnished for the cultivation of properties included in the conveyance from Tornabells & Co. to Aran y Lanci, and that previous to the giving of the mortgage the advances made by the firm were secured by a pledge of one of the'mortgage notes executed by Aran y Lanci in favor of Duran y Cat, which, when Aran y Lanci mortgaged the property in favor of the firm of Fritze, Lundt & Co., was produced by him as the owner thereof and cancelled. In this case, also, no personal responsibility was assumed by Aran y Lanci. The twelfth and thirteenth paragraphs state sales by Aran y Lanci, in 1903 and 1905, to named persons, of pieces of the property acquired by him from .Tornabells & Co., and the production, by Aran y Lanci, as extinguished and paid, of the mortgage notes resting upon the property so conveyed, identified with the mortgage in favor of Duran y Cat. The fourteenth paragraph simply embraced a general statement of the release of the Duran y Cat mortgage on.the properties referred to in the tenth to the thirteenth paragraphs, inclusive, and that the mortgages and conveyances referred to in

WILL v. TORNABELLS.

217 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

such paragraphs "were, in each and every case, duly recorded in the Registry of Property prior to any record in the Registry of Property of the judgments obtained by complainants herein against Tornabells & Co., referred to in paragraph nine."
From the facts thqs found the court drew the following conclusions of law:
"1. That the proof on behalf of complainants is not sufficient to entitle them to any relief under their bill of complaint.
'2. That there is not now, and never was, any such stat-
ute in Porto Rico as the statute of 13th Elizabeth in England, referring to fraudulent conveyances, because we have the civil law rule here instead of the common law. Every State in the Union has a reenactment of the statute of Elizabeth in some form or other among its laws. In the absence of it there is no rule of' law preventing a debtor, even when insolvent, for even that does not take from him the power of disposition of his property, and paying his debts with it, or a portion of his debts, and preferring one or more of his creditors with absolute intent to hinder, delay or even to defeat other creditors. If the favored creditor receives no more than is due him, and permits the debtor to secure no advantage to himself, the transaction will be upheld.
"3. That the statute of limitations of one year, as fixed by article 37 Pf the mortgage law, is applicable to suits like the
one at bar.
"4. That complainants, under the pleadings and proofs herein, are not entitled to subject the properties described in the bill of complaint herein to any lien, interest or decree, by which the complainants would be entitled to have the conveyance and mortgages described in said bill of complaint cancelled and annulled for the benefit of the said complainants.
"5. That the bill of complaint should be dismissed." These conclusions were followed by the reproduction of portions of the testimony to, rescrve the right to review cer-

OCTOBVR TERM, 109.

217 U. S.

tain rulings of the court respecting testimony offered on behalf of the complainants.
The assignments of error are seven in number. The seventh we at once put out of view, as it only charges generally that the court erred in dismissing the bill of complaint.
The sixth, fifth and fourth assignments concern rulings as to the admissibility of testimony, and the third complains of the action of the court maintaining the plea of prescription of one year. As these assignments cannot be disposed of without in some respect appreciating the merits, we temporarily forego considering them.
The remaining assignments, that is, the first and second, are as follows:
,"First, the court erred in finding as matter of law that in Porto Rico there was no rule of law preventing a debtor, even though insolvent, from preferring one creditor over others with absolute intent to hinder, delay or even defeat the just claims of said others.
"Second, the court erred in finding as matter of law, from the facts found, that the above rule of law was applicable and in not finding as matter of law that the applicable rule was that a debtor could not transfet his property without any consideration for the purpose of delaying or defeating the just claims of his creditors."
It is apparent that these propositions assert that a twofold error was committed, first, in n6t applying to the facts as found the legal principle rightfully applicable; and, second, by erroneously stating the law in the irrelevant proposition which was mistakenly applied in deciding -the cause, The first contention rests upon the theory that the facts found established that the conveyance and mortgages which the bill assailed were mere fraudulent simulations, and upon 'this assumption insists that the case should have beep controlled by the law applicable to that state of fact instead of being governed, as it was, by considering how far, as a matter of law, a debtor, being insolvent, had .a right, through a real and

WILL v. TORNABELLS.

217 U.S.

Opinion of the Court.

bona fi transaction,. to prefer one or mot-e of his creditors. But when the findings of facts are considered it is manifest that the premise upon which the proposition rests is a false one, since it cannot be indulged in without disregarding the findings. We say this is manifest, because the third finding of fact, which we have already quoted, expressly declares that the documentary evidence introduced on behalf of the complainants and the testimony of all the witnesses did not establish that the conveyance from Tornabells & Co. to Aran y Lanci
and the mortgage made by him to the firm of Duran & Coll and to Duran y Cat individually were ".voluntarily made to hinder and delay the complainants in the collection of their debts." The error which would have resulted from applying the doctrine applicable to a mere simulated transfer to a case where the findings established that simulation was not shown is self-evident. This result, which necessarily arises from a consideration of the mere text of the third finding, is also demonstrated, if that finding be contemplated in the light of the issues which the cause presented in connection with the other findings and all the conclusions of law which were deduced therefrom and applied in deciding the cause. The essential charge which the complaint made was the fraudulent and simulated character of the conveyance and mortgages which were assailed. That issue was, therefore, the controlling question to be decided. Considering the findings, as we have previously fully stated them, it is, we think, clear that the third finding was intended by the court as a statement of its conclusion of fazt as to that controlling issue, and that the first conclusion of law which the court stkted, that is, the insufficiency of the proof to justify recovery by the complainants, was intended as the legal resultant of the finding which had established that there had .been a failure
to prove the charge of simulation. We think it is also clear that the second proposition of law
which the court announced, that is, the right of a debtor under the Porto Rican law, although insolvent, to give a

OCTOBER TERM, 1909.

217 IL S.

preference, in no way detracted from or modified the previous finding and conclusion as to the absence of proof of simulation
or purpose to hinder and delay creditors in the conveyance from Tornabells & Co. to Aran y Lanci and the Duran y Cat
and the Duran & Coil mortgage, but was solely intended as responsive to the findings in other respects. That is to say, we think the second finding of law was responsive to the facts found in the paragraphs other than number three, which tended to establish that, even although the sale from Tornabells & Co. to Aran y Lanci was not simulated and not in. tended to hinder and delay creditors, nevertheless Aran y Lanci had discharged a portion of the credit price which he had agreed to pay by making payments to third persons, creditors of the firm of Tornabells & Co., in extinguishment of the indebtedness of the firm to such creditors, and thus to the extent of such pAyments preferring the creditors. paid out of the price due to Tornabells & Co. as the result of the sale.
Indeed, unless the appreciation which we have just made ofthe findings and the conclusions of law deduced therefrom be correct, it would cause the findings of fact to be absolutely silent on the issue of simulation, although that issue was the controlling one in the cause, an issue indeed so essential that it is impossible to conceive that the cause could have been disposed of on its merits without a finding on the subject. But if the findings could be thus envisaged the inquiry would be at once suggested whether they were not so manifestly irresponsive to the case as made by the pleadings and to the facts necessarily involved in the decision rendered as to cause them to.be no findings at all, and therefore to require at our hands an affirmance of the judgment because of the substantial absence of any finding to enable us to review. Gray v. Smith, 108 U. S. 12. Concerning this suggestion, however, we express no opinion, since we do not consider that the findings are of the unsubstantial and irrelevant character which would result from attributing to them the construction contended for by the appellants.

WILL v. TORNABELLS.

217 U. S.

Opinioa of the Court.

Our conclusion that the findings of fact exclude the contention concerning the simulated character of the assailed contracts renders it unnecessary to review the authorities cited in argument to*establish the proposition, which is not challenged, that under the law of Porto Rico creditors possess the right to set aside mere fraudulent and simulated contracts or conveyances made by their debtor to or in favor of an interposed person, in order to place the!property of the debtor apparently in the name or under the control of such person for the purpose of defeating creditors.
The substantial foundation upon which the cause was.based, that is, the issue as to the simulation of the conveyance to Aran y Lanci and the mortgage to Duran y Cat and the firm of Duran & Coil being disposed of, the remaining contentions are free from difficulty. We say this because, although it is elaborately insisted that putting the question of simulation out of view, the court was wrong in its second legal conclusion, to the effect that the law of Porto Rico did not avoid a real and. otherwise valid contract merely because its result was to prefer one or more creditors of the debtor making the contract, we think such contention is shown by the record to be an afterthought, or if not is unsupported by the provisions of law which are cited to maintain it. An afterthought because the entire theory of the bill was opposed to the conception that the assailed transactions merely embodied preferences giving rise to a revocatory action that is merely to have an otherwise valid contract revoked. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine that the action in any aspect was considered as but revocatory in character when it is. borne in mind that although the mortgage in favor of Duran. y Cat' covered fifteen pieces of real estate securing 130,000 pesos, he was not served with process, and after his death, on motion of the complainants,, the cause was dismissed as to his heirs, upon the theory that they had no interest in the result. We say that the contention as to preference, if not an afterthought, is unsupported by, the provisions of law relied upon,

since those which are referred to plainly relate to cases of simulation, and even if applicable to a question of preference, tend to support the view stated by the court in its second conclusion of law. Forinstance, the military order of Match 5, 1899, deals but with simulated transfers, and when its context is considered we think also concerns alone sales made seemingly for cash, and therefore, for a twofold reason, is) inapposite to the question of mere preference arising from a contract for a legal consideration, although not immediately payable in cash. So also the general provisions of article 1101 of the Civil Code, providing that those who fraudulently neglect to fulfill their obligations are liable in damages, those of article 1275, declaring that contracts without a consideration or with an illicit consideration can have no legal effect, and the terms of article 1276, providing that the statement of a false consideration in contracts shall render them void unless it be proven that they were based on another and licit consideration, may be put out of view, since they simply announce undisputed propositions of law which are not involved in the case before us, and which are not disputed by any one. And a like reason is also adequate to dispose of the contention based upon the third paragraph of article 1291 of the Civil Code, which embraces in the enumeration of contracts which may be rescinded "those executed in fraud of creditors when the latter cannot recover in any other manner what is due them." We say this, since this provision clearly limits the right of the creditor to rescind to cases where he cannot otherwise recover his debt without resorting to an action for rescission, and even in such case only confers such right where
the contract sought to be rescinded is one which is in fraud of his rights. To contend, as is in effect done in the argument at bar, that the article gives to a creditor a right to sue to rescind any contract made by his insolvent debtor, simply because without rescission the creditor cannot otherwise recover his debt, is to distort the elause..by misconceiving its obvious meaning. The power to seek rescission being thus

limited to contracts which are in fraud of the rights of the creditor, the question is, Did the court below err in holding *that under the law of Porto Rico contracts made by an insolvent debtor which were not fraudulent simulations, because made upon adequate consideration, are not susceptible of being rescinded merely because their execution operated a preference in favor of a creditor? We are cited to no express provision of the local law, or referred to any decision so interpreting that la*, and we think an analysis of the provisions of the local law .relied upon for the purpose of inferentially showing that the court below erred, clearly not only do not support but refute the contention we are considering. Thus the provision expressly authorizing the right to rescind payments made by an insolvent debtor on account tohfeobdleigbatotironcsouwldhich, at the time of making the payments,
not be compelled to makq (Civil Code, art. 1292), plainly import the validity of such a payment under other circumstances. So, also, the provision creating a presumption of fraud as to alienations for valuable consideration made by an insolvent debtor against whom a condemnatory judgment has been rendered or a writ of seizure of property has been issued (Civil Code, art. 1297), also gives rise to the inference thatwhere these circumstances do not exist the contrary rule would apply. And the inferences which are deducible from the text of the code are cogently fortified by a consideration of the mortgage law. Thus, while the law contains an enumeration of the suits which may be brought for the rescission of conveyances made for the purpose of defrauding creditors, and includes those made without consideration when the third person was a iarty to the fraud (Mortgage Law, arts. 36 and 37), it does not mention the case of a mere preference resulting from a contract made for an otherwise valuable consideration. So, also, in article 39, the conveyance without consideration to defraud creditors is expressly limited to those where "there was no price or its equivalent, or any preexisting obligation which had fallen

due," an affirmative prohibition which would seem necessarily to exclude a right to rescind a contract because of mere preference where there was a price or its equivalent, or where the consideration was a preexisting obligation which had fallen due.
The foregoing considerations cause it to be unnecessary to pass on the error which it is alleged was committed in maintaining the plea of prescription of one year. It remains thercfore only to dispose of the errdrs based upon the action of the court in disposing of objections to testimony. They relate to two subjects, the first to objections made to the admissibility of the testimony of Mr. Cornwell, one of the attorneys of record of the.. complainants, concerning statements made to him by members of the firm of Tornabells & Co. in reference to their intention to dispose of or mortgage their property, and the other to the testimony'of the same witness concerning statements made to him by the widow of Tornabells after the death of her husband, and during the pendency of the cause, as to alleged conversations had by her with her husband tending to show the simulation of the contracts which were assailed. To pass upon the contentions on these subjepts a statement of what transpired at the time the. evidence in question was proffered and of the action of the court thereon is essential. While testimony was being taken in open court Mr. Cornwell,
one. of the attorneys for he complainants, was offered as a witness on their behalf. It developing at once from the:questions put to him that the purpose was to draw from the witness statements made to him by the meifabers of the firm of Tornabells & Co. shortly before the assailed conveyance and mortgage were executed, objection was made that such statementswere incompetent, because at the time they were made Cornwell was the attorney for the firm and its members, and therefore the statements were not admissible because privileged communications. Thereupon the examining counsel, while not denying that at the time the statements were made the relation of attorney and client existed, insisted that the

217 U. .

Opinion of the Court.

statements. were admissible, because their character was such as to cause them to be outside of the privilege. The court declaring that it would reserve its ruling on the objection until it had an opportunity to examine the subject during the noon recess, the examination of the witness proceeded for the purpose of showing his professional relation to the firm of Tornabells & Co. at the time of the making of the statements. When the court convened after the recess the subject of the admissibility of the offered testimony was at once taken up. The court intimating doubt on the subject, the counsel making the objection declared that. he had witnesses present by whon he expected to prove that Mr. Corn-
well not only was the confidential legal adviser of Tornabells & Co. at the time the statements were made to him concerning which it Was desired to question him, but that he continued to act for that firm as their attorney after the assailed contracts were made up to the time of the bringing of this suit.
Answering this statement, the counsel for complainants declared that his position was that the offered proof was irrelevant in view of the ruling in Dent v. Ferguson, 132 U. S. 50, to the effect that the privilege did not extend to statements made by a client to his attorney of the intention of the
cient'to commit a fraud. -The court then announced as follows: "I am going to.permit Mr. Cornwell to testify, reserving the right to see what it is, giving to all the counsel a right to extept." Upon this announcement counsel for the defendants insisted upon being permitted' to call witnesses to establish the existence of the professional relation of the witness with the firm as previously stated and proceeded to do so. After testimony had been given and documentary evidence introduced without objection, tending to show the existence of the relation of attorney and. client between the witness and the firm of Tornabells & Co., in accordance with the previous declaration as to what was proposed to be proven on that subject, the court interrupted the taking of the testimony
as follows:
VOL. CCXvI--5

OCTOBER TERM, 1909.

Opinion of the Court.

217"U. S.

The Court: It doesn't change the court's mind as to admitting the testimony in the way it intimates. It will let it in.
"Mr. Dexter: I desire to except against that ruling. "The Court: Give an exception to, all counsel that wish it.
"Mr. Dexter: I want my objection to clearly appear: (1) It is incompetent because of the relation of attorney and client; (2) It is incompetent under the United State statute; and (3) Because of the party being dead.
"Mt . Boerman: I want an exception to every question given."
The witness Cornwell was then recalled and was fully
examined and cross-examined, not only in regard to'the. alleged statements, but as to his professional relations with the firm of Tornabells & Co. when the statements as to which he testified were made, and thereafter up to or nearly about the time of the bringing of this suit.
Beyond question, the testimony established that: the witness had been the confidential legal adviser of the firm of Tornabells & Co. up to and at the time when the statements as to which he t'estified were made. Without reproducing the testimony as to the statements, we think it suffices to say that on the examination-in-chief of the witness he repeated a conversation had with both members of Toma-
bells & Co. a short while before the making of the conveyance to Aran y Lanci and the mortgage by the latter of the prop-
erty, which conversation was odcasioned by the fact that the members of the firm called upon the witness as their legal adviser, either to consult him or to state to him the purpose of the firm to convey or mortgage its property, and that the witness, on his examination, stated that hb construed the statements made to him by his clients as unfblding a purpose
on their part to make a simulated transfer of their property to defraud their creditors,,and that he, the witness, declared he could not represent tnem in the matter or have anything
to do*with it. The second statement testified to a conversation had with Doitteau, one of the members of the firm, after

WILL v. TORNABELIS.

217 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

the assailed conveyance and mortgage had been put upon the record, which the witness considered was an admission by Doitteau of the fraud and an explanation on the ground that he consented to it because of the influence of his partner Tornabells. It is also true, however, that the statements made by the witness on cross-examination tended to qualify the impression -as to the conversation resulting from his statements-in-chief, and to indicate that the purpose of the members of the firm, as disclosed by them in the conversation, was either to sell o r mortgage their property in order to raise money to apply to their debts, and that the witness thought that .this purpose was illegal, because it was intended with the funds which might be raised to prefer particular creditors. It was established that at the time of the first conversation the witness, although the attorney of the firm, had to its knowledge the claim of one of its creditors in bis hands professionally. It was also stated that after the conversations
above referred to and after the witness had knowledge of the existence of! the assailed conveyance and mortgage, he continued both to have personal and professional relations with the firm. He brought a number of suits in its behalf during the two years which elapsed between the making of the assailed conveyance and mortgage and the bringing of this suit. In fact, the claim which was in the witness' hands at the time of the conversation with the members of the firm was some time afterwards merged to judgment by a confession by the'members of the firm, *whichwas written in the
office of the witness by one of his associates. Precisely when the witness became the counsel for all the complainants does not exactly appear, but. certain is it that he stated in his testimony that he was to receive a large contingent fee, amounting in several of the cases to fifty per cent of the amount recovered. The case, as we have at the outset said, was decided some months after its. submission, and six months therbafter the-statement of facts to which we have referred, accompanied with extracts from the evidence, was

certified by the court. After reproducing in the statement the extracts frOm the testimony the court said:
"As appears from the above the court tentatively allowed the foregoing evidence of said witness Cornwell to be admitted, but subsequently, upon the consideration of the testimony as a whole and upon making its findings of fact and law and rendering its decision herein, the court did determine and rule that defendants' objections to the testimony of said witness, Cornwell, in so far as same related to conversations between said witness and Joaquin Tornabells, Carlos Doitteau and Luis Aran, should be sustained and said testimony excluded, because the plan outlined by. said Tornabells during said conversation did not constitute a fraud upon creditors under the laws of Porto Rico at that time in force, hence the privilege existing as to confidential communications between attorney and client was applicable thereto, and further, because such testimony- involved admissions of a dead man against the interests of his own heirs, who are parties to the suit."
It is upon this statement that the contention is based that the court illegally rejected the testimony of the witness Cornwell. But, when the statement is accurately considered, it -appears that instead of rejecting the testimony the court weighed and considered it, and but declared that on its face it did not tend to establish a fraud within the meaning of the Porto Rico law, and hence that the statements were privileged. As the fraud on the part of the firm of Tornabells & Co. which was charged in the bill, -and the fraud which it was insisted
was demonstrated by the statements made to the witness were in substance one and the same, it necessarily follows that the finding of the court, that the statements .testified to did not tend to show the fraud which it was asserted they did show, was but an expression of the conclusion of the court upon the facts involved in the merits of the controversy, .and therefore is embraced in its finding of fact which we may not review. If, however, we could otherwise consider the action of the court, we are constrained to say, upon an examination of the

WILL v. TORNABELLS.

217 U.S.

Opinion of the Court.

testimony of the witness, made part of the certificate, that we think the court was right in concluding that the testimony did not establish a sufficient foundation to relieve the witness from the obligation resting upon him as the result of his professional relations.
The error which it is insisted the court committed as to the statements of the widow of*Tornabells need only be briefly noticed. In the course of his examination the witness Cornwell was asked concerning statements made to him by Mrs. Tornabells of conversations which she 'stated she had with her husband, tending to show that the assailed contracts were simulated, the statements to the witness having been made after the death of Mr. Tornabells. In reference to the motives which induced Mrs. Tornabells to make to him the statements about which the witness was asked, he said that she represented herself to be ingreat pecuniary distress and was desirous of ascertaining whether she and her children could not in some way be benefited if the pending suit assailing the conveyance and mortgage of the property was successful. Indeed, on cross-examination, the witness said:
"Q.* Is it a fact, Mr. Cornwell, that a contract was made
between your firm and this woman to give her either money or property?
"A. If it was, it was made afterwards by Judge Pettingill and Mr. Horton.
"Q. I am asking you if it was. "A. I don't know. I am out at the mill the most of the time." On objection being made to the witness testifying to the statements of Mrs. Tornabells as to the conversations with her deceased husband, the court declared that the objection would be overruled pro forma, with a right to sustain it later, and gave counsel for the defendants an exception. Thereupon the counsel for the complainants declared as follows: "I want to get on the record that it is not claimed by the
complainants that this statement, whatever it may be, made

OCTOBER TERM, 1909.

by the widow of Tomabells as a defendant in this case, binds any defendant or is admissible against any defendant except herself and the minor children whom she represents."
After this declaration the witness testified as to the statements made to him by Mrs. Tornabells concerning conversations with her husband, the substance of which tended to show that the assailed contracts were fraudulent simulations. Although the testimony was thus in the case when it was submitted to the court for decision, in its certificate appended to the statement of facts to which we have already referred the court said that in disposing of the case it, in effect, concluded that the statement by Mrs. Tornabells as to the conversations with her husband were inadmissible, because they were hearsay, Mrs. Tornabells not having been called as a witness, and because, in any event, it was incompetent to establish the want of good faith in written contracts .made by a deceased person by repeating conversations had with him during his lifetime. Conceding that the action of the court can be. construed. as indicating thiat it rejected the testimony instead of simply weighing it, and found it insufficient to prove the alleged fraud, we think it suffices to say, without further elaboration, that the reasons stated by the court are, on their face, adequate to sustain its conclusion. Besides, as the testimony of the witness Cornwell concerning the statements made by the widow Tornabells was offered only as against her and her children and not against the other defendants, it clearly results that no prejudicial error could in any event have resulted from the ruling, even on the hypothesis that the administratrix was competent by a mere admission to injuriously affect the estate of her minor children, which the court made, in view of its finding as to the rights of the other defendants.
Affirmed.
