YUMA COUNTY WATER USERS' ASSOCIATION ET AL. v. SCHLECHT ET.AL.

APPEAL

FROM

THE

CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS NINTH CIRCUIT.

FOR THE

No. 268. Argued February 28, 1923.-Decided April 30, 1923.

1. Preliminary, tentative opinions of the cost of constructing projected irrigation works, expressed by government engineers and officials in official correspondence and in statements at a meeting of prospective water-users, do not constitute the estimate of cost, or the public notice, required by § 4 of the Reclamation Act, and, though relied upon by the water-users in subjecting their lands to the project, do not bind or estop the Government from afterwards ficing the construction charges against the lands pursuant to the statute, in accordance with a higher estimate arrived at in the light
of further investigation and experience. P. 143. 2. The Reclamation Act, § 4, contemplates a precise and formal pub-
lic notice, stating the lands irrigable under a project, the limit of
area for each entry, the charges per acre, the number of annual instalments, and the time when payments shall commence. P. 144. 3. The determination by the Secretary of the Interior of the practicability of a project and the making of the construction contracts are conditions precedent to the estimate of cost and the public notice, under § 4 of the act. P. 145. 4. The time within which the notice shall be given, after the occurrence of these conditions, is left to the sound discretion of the Secretary; and he may delay the notice while the question of cost remains in doubt. P. 145.

Opinion of the Court.

5. A contract between the Government and a water-users' association provided for payment of the first instalment of charges at the time of completion of proposed works, and reserved the right of the Secretary of the Interior to make such changes of the plans "as further investigations and circumstances" might "dictate to be requisite for the public welfare ". Held, that the works were not to be deemed incomplete either (a) because a small part of the drainage system was unfinished, the effectiveness of the system not being thereby detracted from, or (b) because two of three tracts which the Government undertook to reclaim were eliminated by the Secretary, in the exercise of his discretion, greater areas having been substituted which more than counterbalanced any injury that otherwise might have resulted to complaining water-users in the matter of increased assessments. P. 146.
6. Concurrent findings of fact of the District Court and the Circuit Court ot Appeals, sustaining a determination of the Secretary of the Interior that reclamation works had been completed when public notice was given under § 4 of the Reclamation Act, must be accepted by this Court, in absence of clear error.

OCTOBER TERM, 1922.

Opinion of the Court.

262 U. S.

On April 8, 1904, the Secretary of the Interior received the report of a board of consulting engineers, made at his request, giving alternative estimates of the cost of the project, and recommending that $3,000,000 be set aside for construction. This report was followed by a letter from the Director of the Geological Survey, joining in the recommendation and, among other things, saying:
"In general the reports indicate that by means of construction of a dam across Colorado River and other works, it will be possible to reclaim upwards of 85,000 acres of land at a cost of less than $40 per acre.
"The land is extremely fertile in character, the climate is somewhat tropical, and the products have such value per acre that it is believed that the cost of $40 per acre is not prohibitive.
"There are a large number of alternatives to be considered and difficult problems to be solved, but the matter has developed from the engineering side to a point where it is possible to consider the larger features and to set aside provisionally a sufficient sum of money to carry out the work contingent upon satisfactory arrangements being made with the owners of lands and vested rights and the complete solution of other matters now pending."
The Secretary, on May 10, 1904, replied approving the recommendation. Correspondence ensued between the Water Users' Association and the officials of the Reclamation Service, and on May 28, 1904, a meeting between them was had. It does not seem necessary to give the details of this correspondence or of the meeting. It suffices to say that, throughout, the officials declared that in their opinion the project would cost at the rate of about $35 per acre, and the water users joined in the en-
terprise under that belief. True, it was stated that this sum might be increased or lessened as the work progressed and the opinion was otherwise qualified; but it
was evidently thought that the cost would not depart

Opinion of the Court.

from the figures given to any great extent one way or the other. Thereupon the land owners subscribed for shares in the association, binding themselves to pay the cost of the project in proportion to their interests and pledging their lands as security to that end.
On May 31, 1906, the association, acting for its shareholders, entered into an agreement with the Government by which it was stipulated: that the Secretary should determine the number of acres capable of irrigation under the project; that payments should, be divided into not less than ten equal annual installments, the first payable at the time of the completion of the works, or within a reasonable time thereaftei and after due notice from the Secretary; and that the cost per acre should be equal throughout the district. And the association agrees "that it will promptly collect or require prompt payment in such manner as the Secretary of the Interior may direct, and hereby guarantees the payments for that part of the cost of the irrigation works, which shall be apportioned by the Secretary of the Interior to its shareholders. . ." The contract is silent as to the amount of the cost and nowhere suggests that it had already been fixed.
It does not appear that a definite plan of construction was determined upon until after the meeting in 1904; the report of the engineers contains no estimate in respect of the works as they were finally constructed; and no construction contract was made until June, 1905. In the process of construction, great and unexpected difficulties were encountered. The contractors finding themselves unable to proceed, abandoned their contract and the Government was forced to take upon itself the burden of completing the work. The ultimate cost was more than double what had been anticipated. The project was finally completed, as found by both lower courts, on April 6, 1917, and on that date public notice was given

262 U. S.

by the Secretary, imposing upon the water users a construction charge of $75 per acre. This notice complies with the provisions of § 4 of the Reclamation Act, 32 Stat. 388, 389, c. 1093, printed in the margin.1
Appellants (plaintiffs) brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona to enjoin the defendants , who were officials of the Reclamation Service, from putting into operation the determination of the Secretary so as to exact a greater sum than $35.28 per acre. The court, after a trial, found in favor of the Government and dismissed the bill and its action was affirmed by the Court of Appeals (275 Fed. 885), from whose decree the case comes here by appeal.
The pleadings are voluminous, much testimony was taken at the trial and a large number of errors have been assigned. After eliminating from consideration those matters which are clearly immaterial or without merit, two questions remain. They are:
"Sec. 4. That upon the determination by the Secretary of the
Interior that any irrigation project is practicable, he may cause to be let contracts for the construction -of the same, in such portions or sections as it may be practicable to construct and complete as parts of the whole project, providing the necessary funds for such portions or sections are available in the reclamation fund, and thereupon he shall give public notice of the lands irrigable under such project, and limit of area per entry, which limit shall represent the acreage which, in the opinion of the Secretary, may be reasonably required for the support of a family upon the lands in question; also of the charges which shall be made per acre upon the said entries, and upon lands in private ownership which may be irrigated by the waters of the said irrigation project, and the number of annual installments, not exceeding ten, in which such charges shall be paid and the time when such payments shall commence. The said charges shall be determined with a view of returning to the reclamation fund the estimated cost of construction of the project, and shall be apportioned equitably: Provided, That in all construction work eight hours shall constitute a day's work, and no Mongolian labor shall be employed thereon."

YUMA WATER ASSN. v. SCHLECHT. 143

138

Opinion of the Court.

(1) Whether the report, correspondence and state-
ments made in 1904 constituted an estimate of the cost of the project and a public notice, under the terms of § 4;
and, if not, whether the notice of 1917 may be so regarded?
(2) Whethr the project was completed on April 6, 1917, within the meaning of the contract of 1906?
First. It is contended by appellants that the report of the engineers, the correspondence among the officials and with the Water Users' Association and the statements made at the meeting in 1904, taken together, constitute an estimate of cost binding on the Government, and, though informal, a compliance with § 4 as to public notice. That it was the firm belief of the government officials that the cost of the project would not greatly, if at all, exceed $35 an acre, and that their opinion to that effect was given to the Water Users' Association, by the documents and statements referred to, does not admit of doubt. It seems clear that the water users relied upon these expressions of opinion, and it may be assumed that if they had known in the beginning that the cost was to be as much as $75 per acre they would not have gone forward with the enterprise. But however confidently these opinions were expressed and however much they may have influenced the water users, the attendant circumstances, the language employed and the statutory requirements all preclude the idea that they constituted an estimate of the cost as contemplated by the statute. No element of fraud or bad faith is shown or suggested. The Reclamation Act sets aside all money received from the sale and disposal of public lands in certain States and Territories named for the reclamation of the arid lands therein; and this fund is to be kept intact as nearly as possible by collecting from the water users under each project the estimated cost of the construction thereof. See Swigart v. Baker, 229 U. S. 187, 197. The extent to which the fund will be preserved, obviously, will depend

Opinion of the Court.

262 U. S.

upon the accuracy of the estimate, and this in turn, will depend upon the care exercised in securing information upon which to base it. Investigation as to the feasibility of any project, opinions of experts and collection of data relating to the question of cost must precede such an estimate, and § 4, moreover, requires that the charges against water users shall not be assessed until after construction contracts shall have been made, the evident purpose being to put the Secretary in possession of the data furnished by the contracts themselves before he acts in that respect. Prior to the making .of the construction contracts, opinions expressed by engineers or officials may be estimates in one sense, but they are tentative and preliminary and cannot be regarded as constituting the required statutory estimate, though contributing to the basic facts upon which it is made. See Payette-Boise Water Users' Ass'n. v. Cole, 263 Fed. 734, 738-739. The statute contemplates a precise and formal public notice which must state the lands irrigable under the project, the limit of area for each entry, the charges to be made per acre, the number of annual installments and the time when the payments shall commence. The opinions, correspondence and statements relied upon do not fulfill the statutory requirements and we must hold that the Government is neither bound nor estopped by them. Utah Power & Light Co. v. United States, 243 U. S. 389, 408-409; Pine River Logging Co. v. United States, 186 U. S. 279, 291; Whiteside v. United States, 93 U. S. 247, 256-257; The Floyd Acceptances, 7 Wall. 666, 676; Filor v. United States, 9 Wall. 45, 49; Hart v. United States, 95 U. S. 316; Lee v. Munro, 7 Cranch, 366. Moreover, the contract of 1906, made subsequently, expressly provides for payment on the part of the water users "for that part of the cost of the irrigation works which shall be apportioned by the Secretary of the Interior to its shareholders." Plainly this looked forward to

YUMA WATER ASSN. v. SCHLECHT.

Opinion of the Court.

future action on his.part and did not rest upon any action
already taken. Following the provisions requiring the Secretary to
determine the practicability of the project and to make construction contracts the words are "and thereupon he shall give public notice," etc. The word "thereupon" is construed by appellants as an adverb of time, meaning immediately thereafter. But this is only one of its uses.
It is employed more frequently to express the relation of cause or of condition precedent. It is in the latter sense that it is used here, and its meaning is that the determination as to the practicability of the project and the making
of contracts are precedent conditions to the estimate of cost and public notice. See Porphyry Paving Co. v. Ancker, 104 Cal. 340, 342. The notice must follow the coming into existence of the conditions. The time thereafter within which it shall be given is left, and from the nature of the matter must be left, to the discretion of the Secretary, and whether that discretion has been unreasonably exercised will depend upon the circumstances of ch case. Here it is made plain that performance of the construction contract became impossible and the same was abandoned. Acting upon its judgment, which so far as the record shows was not unreasonable, the Government then itself undertook the completion of the work. Physical conditions not originally foreseen were encountered, presenting difficulties and requiring increased.expenditures of great magnitude. It does not appear that these expenditures were made unnecessarily or improvidently; nor is there anything in the record to indicate that the work was not done with reasonable expedition. The uncertainties arising from the newly discovered conditions, the abandonment of the construction work by the contractors, the changes which were necessitated in the original plans, and the unexpected turn of events in other respects, left the question of cost in such doubt as to justify withholding

the public notice until it could rest on more definite infor-

mation. The delay, it is true, was long continued but,

under all the circumstances, we cannot say as a matter

of law, that it was undue or that the Secretary's discretion

in respect of the time was unreasonably exercised.

Second. The contract of May 31, 1906, provides that

the first installment shall be payable at the time of the

completion of the proposed works, and appellants contend

that in two respects they were not completed on April 6,

1917, when the public notice was given: (1) that complete

drainage for one of the tracts was not provided, and (2)

that only one of three tracts which the Government prom-

ised to reclaim was reclaimed.

As to the first point, it is sufficient to say .that the tes-

timony shows that the contemplated drainage was sub-

stantially completed, and fails to show that the small por-

tion left undone detracted in any way from the effective-

ness of the system.

As to the second point, the original plans disclose that

it was the intention to reclaim the three tracts mentioned,

but the Secretary reserved the right to make such changes "as further investigations and circumstances may dictate

to be requisite for the public welfare." The elimination,

therefore, of the two tracts was within his discretion.

Moreover, while these tracts were not reclaimed, other

lands of greater area were added to the project which

much more than counterbalanced any injury to the water

users here concerned that might otherwise have resulted

from the omission. The Secretary determined that the

project had been completed when the public notice was

given and both lower courts concurred in the same finding.

These findings will be accepted here in the absence of clear

error, which the record before us does not show. Bodkin

is no established rule for the determination of what belongs to the one or the other class. It originated with the courts. Generally it is applied to escape difficulties, in order that injustice may not result from the recognition of technical defenses based upon the governmental character of such corporations.6 But such distinction furnishes no ground for the application of constitutional re-
straints here sought to be invoked by the City of Trenton against the State of New Jersey. They do not apply as against the State in favor of its own municipalities. We hold that the City cannot invoke these provisions of the Federal Constitution against the imposition of the license fee or charge for diversion of water specified in the state law here in question.

ERROR to a judgment 'of the Supreme Court of New Jersey, affirmed by the Court of Errors and Appeals, in favor of the State, in its action to recover license fees from the City of Newark, for water diverted from the Pequannock River.

Mr. George W. Wickersham, with whom Mr. Jerome T. Congleton was on the briefs, for plaintiff in error.

Mr. William Newcorn, Assistant Attorney General, with whom Mr. Thomas F. McCran, Attorney General, of the State of New Jersey, was on the brief, for defendant in error.
MR. JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.
The State of New Jersey recovered judgment against the City of Newark for $18,104.08 and costs, in an action brought in the State Supreme Court. The judgment was affirmed by the Court of Errors and Appeals, and the case is here on writ of error. It is based on a state enactment which is attacked on the sole ground that it violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
The State's right to recover depends upon the validity of an enactment of the State (c. 252, Laws of 1907) which is sufficiently set forth in the decision of this Court in Trenton v. New Jersey, handed down on this day, ante, 182.
In East Jersey Water Co. v. Board of Conservation & Development, 91 N. J. L. 448, 453, it is said:
"The statute requires payment 'for all such water. hereafter diverted in excess of the amount now being legally diverted,' with the proviso that no payment be required until the legal diversion shall exceed one hun-
51826*"-23---18

dred gallons per day per capita. We are of opinion that ' legally diverted' means not a future diversion, but one now being exercised under a legal right, and -that under this statute a legal abstractor may take what he was diverting in 1907, and, if that did not reach the statutory maximum of exemption, as much more as is required to make the total diversion one hundred gallons per day per capita for each of the municipalities supplied, without payment of the license fee.
"If, in 1907, the daily diversion exceeded one hundred gallons per capita, the amount then diverted, if lawful, may be taken without payment, and if it was less, no license fee can be imposed until it exceeds the statutory quantity."
The complaint alleged that under the provisions of this act the City was "permitted to divert . . . an average daily free allowance of water to the amount of 36,241,666 gallons, the said last mentioned amount being the amount of water which was being diverted by said municipality on June 17th, aforesaid, the date vhen the act aforesaid became -effective and operative "; and claimed for each of the years subsequent to July 1, 1914, a license fee of one dollar per million gallons for the excess of the daily average diversion of water over the quantity above specified. The answer alleged that prior to the passage of the Act of 1907, the City had acquired a plant capable of furnishing 50,000,000 gallons of water per day, and set up certain separate defenses. At the trial, the court on motion of the State, struck out the separate defenses; the facts were not in controversy, and judgment Was given for the amount claimed. About the same time, the State also recovered judgment against the City of Trenton foi the license fee imposed by the same act. Both cases were taken to the Court of Errors and Appeals, the highest court of the State, and there by one decision the judgments were affirmed. (117 Atl. 158.) That court said:

NEWARK v. NEW JERSEY.

192

Opinion of the Court.

"The facts are not in dispute. It is conceded that the
city of Trenton, at the time of the enactment of the act of 1907, was taking from the Delaware river daily 14,200,000 gallons of water for local use, and that the city of Newark was daily extracting from the Pequannock river 36,241,666 gallons for local use. These diversions represent the antestatutory flowage, and are considered by the state under the eighth section of the act of 1907 to be nontaxable."
To establish its contention that § 8 of the enactment in question so discriminates between those authorized to divert water that it violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the City says that the highest court has in this case construed the words "now being legally diverted" to mean the amount of water which was actually diverted on the day when the act went into effect, namely, June 17, 1907; that had the City flowed into its mains 50,000,000 gallons that day, the tax would have been levied only upon the excess over that amount, and on the facts shown, in the complaint, there would have been no tax in the years above referred to; that the purely accidental figure of 36,241,666 gallons, the amount actually diverted on that day, will for all time be the basis of the assessment of the tax upon the City. It is suggested that cities less populous by one-half than Newark, but owning plants far in excess of their needs might have diverted on June 17, 1907, twice the amount of water which the City of Newark diverted, and that a city twice as large might have diverted half as much, and the former of such cities would thereby have procured an almost perpetual exemption, and the latter would have brought on itself an insupportable burden of indefinite duration; and that accidents of climate, of conflagrations and of breaks in the mains on the critical date, June 17, 1907, would have resulted in increasing the exemption.

OCTOBER TERM, 1922.

Syllabus.

262 U. S.

The enforcement by the State of the provision of the act imposing upon the City the specified annual payments for such diversion of water does not violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The regulation of municipalities is a matter peculiarly within the domain of the State. In Trenton v. New Jersey, decided this day, ante, 182, it is held that the imposition of the license fee specified in this act is not a taking of property of that city in violation of the Four-
teenth Amendment. The reasons supporting that conclusion apply here. The City cannot invoke t he protection of the Fourteenth Amendment against the State.' Considering the former opinions of this Court, there is no substantial federal question in the case.
The writ of error is dismissed.

Opinion of the Court.

ERRoR to a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Jersey, affirmed by the Court of Errors and Appeals, in favor of the State, in its action to recover license fees from the City of Trenton, for water diverted from the Delaware River.

Mr. A. V. Dawes, with whom Mr. Chas. E. Bird was on the brief, for plaintiff in error.
Mr. William Newcorn, Assistant Attorney General, with whom Mr. Thomas F. McCran, Attorney General, of the State of New Jersey, was on the brief, for defendant in error.
MR. JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.
The State of New Jersey recovered judgment against the City of Trenton for $14,310.00, in an action brought in the State Supreme Court. The judgment was affirmed by the Court of Errors and Appeals, and is here on writ of error.
The State's right to recover depends upon the validity of an act of the legislature (c. 252, Laws of 1907). The City asserts that this act offends against the contract clause of the Constitution of the United States, and that it takes property owned by the City in its private or proprietary capacity for public use without just compensation and without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The act provides that:
"Every municipality, corporation or private person now diverting the waters of streams or lakes with outlets for the purpose of a public water-supply shall make annual payments on the first day of May to the State Treasurer for all such water hereafter diverted in excess of the amount now being legally diverted; provided,however, no payment shall be required until such legal diversion shall exceed a total amount equal to one hundred

(100) gallons daily, per capita for each inhabitant of the municipality or municipalities supplied, as shown by the census of one thousand nine hundred and five."
The City claims the right to take from the Delaware
River all the water that it requires without limitation as to quantity and without license fee for any part thereof, and that such right was acquired by the President and Directors of the Trenton Water Works (hereinafter called the water company) by grant direct from the State March 24, 1852, and that the City acquired this right by purchase from the water company. Briefly, the
basis of the City's claim is as follows: By an Act of February 29, 1804, the President and Directors of the Trenton Water Works were created a body politic and corporate. They and their successors and assigns were made capable of disposing of water to such as might apply for the same for such annual rent and under such restrictions as they might think proper, and they were authorized to lay and extend their water mains through the streets of the City. Certain springs constituted the company's source of supply, and by reason of increase of. population ceased to' be adequate. March 24, 1852, a supplement to the above mentioned act was passed, by which the company was authorized to take the water required either in whole or in part from the Delaware River. Later, March 2, 1855, an act was passed, authorizing the City to purchase the whole or a majority of the shares of the capital stock of the water company, and the City purchased all of the stock. Thereafter, an Act of March 1, 1859, required the company to convey unto " the inhabitants of the city of Trenton " all the real estate, works and property and all the corporate powers, franchises and privileges of the company, and this conveyance was duly made.
If the provision of the Act of 1907 imposing the license fee is valid as against the City, the judgment is right.

TRENTON v. NEW JERSEY.

182

Opinion of the Court.

The Court of Errors and Appeals held that it was valid; that the State under its police power might impose a license fee as specified in the act, and that this does not deprive the City of any contractual or property right.
The State undoubtedly has power, and it is its duty, to control and conserve the use of its water resources for the benefit of all its inhabitants, and the Act of 1907 was passed pursuant to the policy of the State to prevent waste and to economize its water resources. Decision of the Court of Errors and Appeals in this case, 117 Atl. 158; McCarter v. Hudson Water Co., 70 N. J. Eq. 695, 701, 702, affirmed by this Court in 209 U. S. 349, 355; Collingswood v. Water-Supply Commission, 84 N. J. L. 104, 110; Cobb v. Davenport, 32 N. J. L. 369, 378. The only way the City could acquire the right to take the water of the Delaware River was by grant from the State or by authorized purchase or condemnation from one to whom the right had been granted by the State. State v. Jersey City, 94 N. J. L. 431, 433. The power to determine the conditions upon which waters may be so diverted is a legislative function. The State may grant or withhold the privilege as it sees fit. Assuming in favor of the City, that its grantor received a perpetual right,
unburdened by license fee or other charge, to divert all the water required for the use of the City and its inhabi-
tants, does it follow that the State as against the City is bound by contract and is without power to impose a license fee as provided in the act?
The relations existing between the State and the water company were not the same as those between the State and the City. The company was organized and carried on its business for pecuniary profit. Its rights and property were privately owned and therefore safeguarded by the constitutional provisions here sought to be invoked by the City against the legislation of the State. The City is a political subdivision of the State, created as a con-

venient agency for the exercise of such of the governmental powers of the State as may be entrusted to it. The diversion of waters from the sources of supply for the use of the inhabitants of the State is a proper and legitimate function of the State. This function may be left to private enterprise, subject to regulation by the State; it may be performed directly; or it may be delegated to bodies politic created for that purpose, or to the municipalities of the State. Power to own, maintain and operate public utilities, such as waterworks, gas and electric plants, street railway systems, public markets, and the like is frequently conferred by the States upon their cities and other political subdivisions. For the purpose of carrying on such activities, they are given power to hold and manage personal and real property.
As said by this Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Moody, in Hunter v. Pittsburgh,207 U. S.161, 178, 179:
"The number, nature and duration of the powers conferred upon these corporations and the territory over which they shall be exercised rests in the absolute discretion of the State. Neither their charters, nor any law conferring governmental powers, or vesting in them property to be used for governmental purposes, or authorizing them to hold or manage such property, or exempting them from taxation upon it, constitutes a contract with the State within the meaning of the Federal Constitution. The State, therefore, at its pleasure may modify or with-
draw all such powers, may take without compensation such property, hold it itself, or vest it in other agencies, expand or contract the territorial area, unite the whole or a part of it with another municipality, repeal the charter and destroy the corporation. All this may be done, conditionally or unconditionally, with or without the consent of the citizens, or even against their protest. In all these respects the State is supreme, and its legislative body, conforming its action to the state constitu-

tion, may do as it will, unrestrained by any provision of the Constitution of the United States. . The power is in the State and those who legislate for the State are alone responsible for any unjust or oppressive exercise of it."
In New Jersey it has been held that within the limits prescribed by the state constitution, the legislature may delegate to municipalities such portion of political power as they may deem expedient, withholding other powers, and may withdraw any part of that which has been delegated. Van Cleve v. Passaic Valley Sewerage Commissioners, 71 N. J. L. 183, 198.
In the absence of state constitutional provisions safeguarding it to them, municipalities have no inherent right of self government which is beyond the legislative control of the State.1 A municipality is merely a department of the State, and the State may withhold, grant or withdraw powers and privileges as it sees fit. However great or small its sphere of action, it remains the creature of the State exercising and holding powers and privileges subject to the sovereign will. See Barnes v. District of Columbia, 91 U. S,540, 544, 545.
In Mount Pleasantv. Beckwith, 100 U. S.514, 524, 525, it was held that where a municipal corporation is legislated out of existence and its territory annexed to other corporations, the latter, unless the legislature otherwise provides, become entitled to all its property and immunities. In the opinion it is said (pp. 524, 525):
"Institutions of the kind, whether called cities, towns,
or counties, are the auxiliaries of the State in the important business of municipal rule; but they cannot have the least pretension to sustain their privileges or their existence upon anything like a contract between themselves and the legislature of the State, because there is

262 U. S.

not and cannot be any reciprocity of stipulation between the parties, and for the further reason that their objects and duties are utterly incompatible with everything par-
taking of the nature of compact." The power of the State, unrestrained by the contract
clause or the Fourteenth Amendment, over the rights and property of cities held and used for" governmental purposes" cannot be questioned. In Hunter v. Pittsburgh, supra, 179, reference is made to the distinction between property owned by municipal corporations in their public
and governmental capacity and that owned by them in their private or proprietary capacity, and decisions of this Court which mention that distinction are referred to.' In none of these cases was any power, right or property of
a city or other political subdivision held to be protected by the contract clause or the Fourteenth Amendment. This Court has never held that these subdivisions may in-
voke such restraints upon the power of the State.' In East Hartford v. Hartford Bridge Co., 10 How. 511,
533, 534, 536, it appeared that for many years a franchise to operate a ferry over the Connecticut River belonged to the town of Hartford; that upon the incorporation of

Opinion of the Court.

East Hartford, the legislature granted to it one-half of the ferry during the pleasure of the General Assembly, and that subsequently, after the building of a bridge across the river, the legislature discontinued the ferry. It was held that this was not inconsistent with the contract clause of the Federal Constitution. The reasons given in the opinion (pp. 533, 534) support the contention of the State here made that the City cannot possess a contract with the State which may not be changed or regulated by state legislation.
In Worcester v. Worcester ConsolidatedStreet Ry. Co., 196 U. S. 539, 548, it was held that the obligation of the street railway Company to the city to pave and repair streets occupied by it, based on accepted conditions of a municipal ordinance granting right of location, is not private property beyond the legislative control of the State, and that state legislation taxing the company and thereby relieving it from its obligation to the city to pave and repair such streets was not void as violating the contract clause of the Federal Constitution. In the opinion it is said (pp. 548, 549):
"The question then arising is, whether the legislature, in the exercise of its general legislative power, could abrogate the provisions of the contract between the city and the railroad company with the assent of the latter, and provide another and a different method for the paving and repairing of the streets through which the tracks of the railroad company were laid under the permit of their extended location. We have no doubt that the legislature of the Commonwealth had that power. A municipal corporation is simply a political subdivision of the State, and exists by virtue of the exercise of the power of the State through its legislative department. The legislature could at any time terminate the existence of the corporation itself, and provide other and different means for the government of the district comprised within the limits of

93 U. S.108, 114. In Pawhuska v. Pawhuska Oil & Gas Co., 250 U. S. 394,
399, it was held that a legislative grant to a city of the power to regulate rates to be charged to the city and its inhabitants by a gas company might be withdrawn by the State from the city and conferred upon a commission, and that thereby no question was presented under the contract clause of the Federal Constitution. In the opinion, after a statement of the issue, it is said (pp. 397, 398):
"Thus the whole controversy is as to which of two existing agencies or arms of the state government is authorized for the time being to exercise in the public interest a particular power, obviously governmental, subject to which the franchise confessedly was granted. In this no question under the contract clause of the Constitution of the United States is involved, but only a question of local law, the decision of which by the Supreme Court of the State is final. . . . In New Orleans v. New Orleans Water Works Co., 142 U. S.79, where a city, relying on the contract clause, sought a review by this court of a judgment of a state court sustaining a statute so modifying the franchise of a water works company as to require the city to pay for water used for municipal purposes, to which it theretofore was entitled without charge, the writ of error was dismissed on the ground that no question of impairm~ent within the meaning of the contract clause was involved."

182

Opinion of the Court.

The distinction between the municipality as an agent of the State for governmental purposes and as an organization to care for local needs in a private or proprietary capacity has been applied in various branches of the law of municipal corporations. The most numerous illustrations are found in cases involving the question of liability for negligent acts or omissions of its officers and agents. See Harris v. District of Columbia, 256 U. S. 650, and cases cited. It has been held that municipalities are not liable for such acts and omissions in the exercise of the police power, or in the performance of such municipal faculties as the erection and maintenance of a city hall and courthouse, the protection of the city's inhabitants against disease and unsanitary conditions, the care of the sick, the operation of fire departments, the inspection of steam boilers, the promotion of education and the administration of public charities. On the other hand, they have been held liable when such acts or omissions occur in the exercise of the power to build and maintain bridges, streets and highways, and waterworks, construct sewers, collect refuse and care for the dump. where it is deposited.' Recovery is denied where the act or omission occurs in the exercise of what are deemed to be governmental powers, and is permitted if it occurs in a proprietary capacity. The basis of the distinction is difficult to state, and there

is no established rule for the determination of what belongs to the one or the other class. It originated with the courts. Generally it is applied to escape difficulties, in order that injustice may not result from the recognition of technical defenses based upon the governmental character of such corporations.6 But such distinction furnishes no ground for the application of constitutional re-
straints here sought to be invoked by the City of Trenton against the State of New Jersey. They do not apply as against the State in favor of its own municipalities. We hold that the City cannot invoke these provisions of the Federal Constitution against the imposition of the license fee or charge for diversion of water specified in the state law here in question. In view of former opinions of this
Court, no substantial federal question is presented. Pawhuska v. Pawhuska Oil & Gas Co., supra, and cases cited.'

Nos. 219, 220, 221. Argued April 19, 20, 1923.-Decided June 11, 1923.
1.

2. Section 18, c. 1278, Pub.

OCTOBER TERM, 1922.

Opinion of the Court.

262 U. S.

MR. JUSTICE SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.
These are suits in equity-brought by the several plaintiffs in error in the Superior Court of Rhode Island, to enjoin the defendants in error from taking possession of or interfering with their property. The proceedings complained of, were taken under an act of the state legislature, purporting to authorize the City of Providence to obtain a supply of pure water. Public Laws, c. 1278, ap-
proved April 21, 1915. The Water Supply Board, whose inembers are made parties defendant, is directed by the act to investigate and determine whether a part of the north branch of the Pawtuxet River and the tributary watershed would be the most available and desirable source of water supply for the City of Providence and for any territories now supplied, or hereafter supplied under the provisions of the act, by means of the waterworks of said city. The board, if it approve the source, is to make a plan, locating storage reservoirs and an aqueduct to carry water therefrom to the city waterworks. § 3.
Thereupon the board is authorized to purchase for and in the name of the city such lands and interests and water rights as may be necessary, when the city council shall have made provision for the necessary funds. § 4.
The city is authorized to acquire by condemnation any lands and interests included within a definitely limited area, which the city council shall deem necessary for the purposes stated in the act. § 5.
The city is further authorized by condemnation to acquire the waters or any part thereof, included within the area, and any water or flowage rights or privileges appurtenant thereto. § 6.
The owner of any mill upon land taken, may surrender the machinery therein to the city within six months after the taking, whereupon the city shall become liable to pay its fair value at the time of delivery as part of the dam-

ages for such taking; or such special damages as may be suffered as a result of a compulsory removal before the expiration of a reasonable time. If the machinery be not surrendered, the reasonable cost of removing it to a new location within the New England States and setting it up is to be paid by the city as part of the damages. § 12.
The city is also required to pay the fair market value of furniture and building equipment, contained in any
building belonging to the town of Scituate, which may be
surrendered (§ 11); the cost of additional police protec-
tion in any town or city in consequence of carrying on construction work (§ 14); damages for decrease in value of lands not taken but contiguous to lands which are taken (§ 15), and limited damages in certain cases for loss of employment due to the taking of the manufacturing
establishment in which claimant is employed (§ 17).
The owner of any business, on lands within certain localities, established prior to the passage of the act, is given the right to recover for injury thereto. § 16.
Certain municipalities and districts within the drainage areas described, when necessary are allowed to take and receive water from the city waterworks for domestic and municipal purposes upon payment therefor at fair wholesale rates or charges, which, in case of disagreement, are to be determined by arbitration. The city is also authorized, under specified limitations, to furnish water to any incorporated water company, for use in any territory included within the drainage areas where there is no public water supply. § 18.
In case any lands purchased or condemned are not required for waterworks purposes, but are held to protect
and preserve the waters from pollution, the city is authorized to lease them under specified restrictions. § 21.
Whenever the city council shall resolve to condemn any property it is required to have filed, in the office of the clerk of the town or city where any of the lands lie, a

statement giving a description of the property taken. Thereupon the title shall vest in the city in fee simple, except where a less estate is specified. The city is authorized to take possession, but not to do so without the consent of the owner, until after the expiration of a year from the date of filing such statement. Payment for the property taken is to be made forthwith if the city and
the owner agree upon the price. If not, the owner is authorized within one year after notice of the taking, or, if not notified, within two years from the date of filing the statement, to have an assessment of damages by a jury, or at his option, by a commission, upon petition to the Superior Court. Upon the entry of judgment the owner may have execution issued against the city. § 23.
Buildings or improvements on lands actually taken may be sold, disposed of or removed when necessary to prevent obstruction to the work. § 25.
The city is given power to borrow all money necessary to secure such water supply, including lands, etc., either by purchase or condemnation and to issue bonds and notes therefor. § 26.
The plaintiff in error in No. 219 has a number of cotton mills and other property interests within the area sought to be condemned, and is a taxpayer in the City of Providence. The plaintiff in error in- No. 220 has, within the same area, water powers and privileges and numerous parcels of land upon which are power plants, transmission lines, fixtures and machinery, used in the business of generating and distributing electricity for light, heat and power. Plaintiff in error in No. 221 has a residence and numerous buildings and improvements, together with water rights and privileges connected therewith, situated in the same area, and is a taxpayer in the City of Providence.
The Water Supply Board, acting under this statute, prepared a description and plat of the lands proposed to

be taken, which was submitted to the city council for action. The council adopted a resolution asserting a taking of lands and interests within the defined area, in-
cluding property of the plaintiffs in error, the title so taken, so far as material here, being in fee simple.
Plaintiffs in error having challenged the constitutionality of the act, the Superior Court certified the three cases to the State Supreme Court for a determination of the questions, in accordance with the provisions of a state statute. General Laws, c. 298, § 1. The Supreme Court decided that the statute was not in conflict with the Constitution of the United States; and thereupon the record, with its decision certified thereon, was sent back to the Superior Court for further proceedings. The last named court dismissed the bills and from its decree the case comes here on writ of error.
The legislation is assailed as contravening the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution.
First. It is contended that the statute imposes a bur-
den upon the taxpayers of the City of Providence by authorizing an expenditure, which in part is for the benefit of other municipalities or of companies outside the city, that are either not required to contribute to sucii expenditure or whose contributions do not constitute just compensation. The basis of this complaint, in so far as it relates to other municipalities and districts, is that they are given the right to take water upon payment of fair wholesale rates therefor, and that these rates need bear no relation to the additional cost incident to the contingency of their coming in.
That the taxpayers of one municipality may not be taxed arbitrarily for the benefit of another may be assumed; but that is not the case here presented. The communities to be supplied are those within the drainage area of the waters authorized to be taken. These waters

are under the primary control of the State and in allowing the City of Providence to appropriate them, it was entirely just and proper for the legislature to safeguard the necessities of other communities who might be dependent thereon, and to that end to impose upon the City of Providence such reasonable conditions as might be necessary and appropriate. Municipalities are political
subdivisions of the State and are subject to the will of the legislature, Trenton v. New Jersey, ante, 182, and may be compelled not only to recognize their legal .obligations but to discharge obligations of an equitable and moral nature as well. Guthrie National Bank v. Guthrie, 173 U. S. 528, 537. The requirement here in question is
one well within the rule. Specifically, it is objected that the act does not require these other communities to bear a proportionate part of the cost of acquisition, construction and maintenance. The special facts which led the legislature to direct payment at wholesale rates, instead of upon the basis of sharing in the cost of the enterprise, or of some other, we need not consider. It may have been, as suggested, that there were inherent difficulties in the way of making such an apportionment. But it is enough to say that the method selected is one within the scope of legislative discretion and not obnoxious to the Federal Constitution. See County of Mobile v. Kimball, 102 U. S. 691, 703-704; Williams v. Eggleston, 170 U. S. 304; Davidson v. New Orleans, 96 U. S. 97, 106.
The legislature is not precluded from putting a burden upon one municipality because it may result in an incidental benefit to another. County of Mobile v. Kimball, supra, at pp. 703-704. Moreover, we cannot assume that the fair wholesale rates to be paid by these outside communities will be less than just compensation for what they get.
The provision in respect of furnishing water to water companies within the area defined is not compulsory, but

JOSLIN CO. v. PROVIDENCE.

668

Opinion of the Court.

permissive, and leaves the city free to fix terms and conditions. It simply gives the city an opportunity to dispose of water, which for the time being it may not need, for compensation; something that is purely incidental to the main purposes of the legislation. No constitutional objection to it is now perceived. Kaukauna Water Power Co. v. Green Bay & Mississippi Canal Co., 142
U. S. 254, 273; United States v. Chandler-DunbarWater Power Co., 229 U. S. 53, 72, 73; Rochester v. Briggs, 50 N. Y. 553, 563. In any event, it is a separable provision and it will be time enough to consider the question of its
constitutionality when some attempt is made to carry it into effect.
Second. The act, it is asserted, denies the equal protection of the laws, among other things, by permitting the owner of a business established prior to the passage of the act to recover for injury thereto while withholding such compensation from one whose business has been established since; and by allowing a mill owner to recover the cost of removing his machinery to a new location within the New England States, while denying a similar right to one desiring to move to a location elsewhere. It is further asserted by plaintiffs in error, in their capacity as taxpayers, that the effect of allowing these and other consequential damages is to deprive them of their property without due process of law.
Injury to a business carried on upon lands taken for public use, it is generally held, does not constitute an element of just compensation (Cox v. Philadelphia,etc., R. R. Co., 215 Pa. St. 506; 2 Lewis on Eminent Domain, 3d ed., § 727), in the absence of a statute expressly allowing it. Whiting v. Commonwealth, 196 Mass. 468; Oakland v. Pacific Coast Lumber Co., 171 Cal. 392, 398. This statute therefore does not deny a right; it grants one, and limits it to a business already established. We cannot say that such a classification is unreasonable or

arbitrary--and certainly, it is not clearly so. The lawmaking body legislated with reference to an existing situation. One who came after the enactment and estab-
lished a business did so with notice that the extra-constitutional compensation provided for would not apply to him. In the difference between an owner who had established a business without notice that his property would be required for public use and one who proceeds in the face of such notice, the legislature evidently found a sufficient and proper basis for classification, and we are not prepared to say that its conclusion was so palpably arbi-
trary as to fall within the prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment. See Arkansas Natural Gas Co. v. Arkansas Railroad Commission, 261 U. S. 379, and cases cited.
If the geographical limitation upon the liability to pay for the removal of machinery, could be said to bring about a classification, the principles just discussed would control; but, in fact, there is no classification. The right is extended to all mill owners, who choose to avail themselves of it, to recover the cost of removal within the defined territory. Ordinarily, the cost of removing personal property from land taken is not a proper element of damage unless made so by express statute (2 Lewis on Eminent Domain, 3d ed., § 728); and it was not an unconstitutional exercise of power for the legislature, in creating the right, to define its extent. Other provisions of the statute alleged to be discriminatory cannot be differentiated in principle from those just discussed.
In respect of the contention that the statute extends
the right to recover compensation so as to include these and other forms of consequential damages and thus deprives plaintiffs in error, as taxpayers of the city, of their property without due process of law, we need say no more than that, while the legislature was powerless to diminish the constitutional measure of just compensation, we are aware of no rule which stands in the way of an extension

of it, within the limits of equity and justice, so as to include rights otherwise excluded. As stated by the Supreme Court of Massachusetts in Earle v. Commonwealth, 180 Mass. 579, 583, speaking through Mr. Justice Holmes, who was then a member of that court: "Very likely the . . . rights were of a kind that might have been dam-
aged if not destroyed without the constitutional necessity of compensation. But some latitude is allowed to the Legislature. It is not forbidden to be just in some cases where it is not required to be by the letter of paramount
law." Third. We next consider the contention that the act
permits the taking of property and grants the power to lease, sell or dispose of it without an offer to pay compensation therefor or a determination of it in advance. It has long been settled that the taking of property for public use by a State or one of its municipalities need not be accompanied or preceded by payment, but that the re,quirement of just compensation is satisfied when the public faith and credit are pledged to a reasonably prompt ascertainment and payment, and there is adequate provision for enforcing the pledge. Sweet v. Rechel, 159
U. S. 380, 400, 404, 407; Williams v. Parker, 188 U. S. 491, 502-503; Crozier v. Krupp, 224 U. S. 290, 306; Bragg
v. Weaver, 251 U. S. 57, 62; Hays v. Port of Seattle, 251 U. S. 233, 238; Adirondack Ry. Co. v. New York, 176 U. S. 335, 349. Under the provisions of § 23 of the statute, if the owner and the city agree upon the amount, payment is to be made forthwith. If they do not agree, the owner at any time within a year after notice of the taking, or, if not notified, at any time within two years after the public filing of the statement thereof, may proceed in the Superior Court by petition to have the compensation assessed by a jury, or, at his option, by a commission. For a year in the meantime, he may not be deprived of possession without his consent. As an additional guar-

anty that the judgment obtained will be paid-and paid promptly-the owner under the statute may have execution issued against the city. These provisions adequately fulfill the requirement in respect of the ascertainment and payment of just compensation, within the principles established by the decisions of this Court last above cited.
Nor is there anything in the complaint that the city, after taking but before payment, is authorized to lease,
sell or dispose of any lands taken and held to protect the purity of the water supply, and to remove buildings or improvements which interfere with the progress of the work. That these are simply incidents in the administration of the statute and in the management of property, title to which has passed to the city, which are of no concern to plaintiffs in error and which in no manner affect the validity of the act, is too clear to require anything beyond statement. See Sweet v. Rechel, supra, pp. 404,
407. Fourth. Finally, the validity of the act is challenged
as denying due process of law, on the ground that the, question of the necessity for taking the property has not been determined by the legislature itself, but is relegated to the city to decide ex parte, without appeal or opportunity for hearing and decision by an impartial tribunal. That the necessity and expediency of taking property for public use is a legislative and not a judicial question is not open to discussion. Adirondack Ry. Co. v. New York, supra, at p. 349; Shoemaker v. United States, 147 U. S. 282, 298; United States v. Gettysburg Electric Ry. Co., 160 U. S. 668, 685; Boom Co. v. Patterson,98 U. S. 403, 406. Neither is it any longer open to question in this court that the legislature may confer upon a municipality
the authority to determine such necessity for itself. Bragg v. Weaver, supra, at p. 58; Sears v. Akron, 246
U. S. 242, 251. The question is purely political, does not require a
hearing, and is not the subject of judicial inquiry. The

The judgment of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia herein does not declare valid any statute of the State or any authority exercised under the State, which is repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States. The most that can be claimed is that the Commission, acting under lawful authority in reaching the conclusion from a disputed state of facts, found and fixed the value of plaintiff's property for rate making purposes at an amount less than some other tribunal may have fixed and determined from a like state of facts. A judgment based upon such a state of facts does not raise such a federal question as gives a right of review from this Court to the highest court of the State by a writ of error.

BLUEFIELD CO. v. PUB. SERV. COMM. 681

679

Argument for Defendants in Error.

The Public Service Commission and the Supreme Court
of Appeals acted under valid state authority. The authority or law under which these respective tribunals exercised jurisdiction not being repugnant to any federal law, what conclusions they may have reached from a
given state of facts which furnishes the basis for the
judgment complained of herein, does not present a question subject to be reviewed by writ of error. Such ques-
tions can be reviewed only on petition for a writ of certiorari. Zucht v. King, 260 U. S. 174; Stadelman v. Miner, 246 U. S. 544; Philadelphia& Reading Coal Co. v. Gilbert, 245 U. S. 162; Ireland v. Woods, 246 U. S. 323.
It is not here contended that a public utility is not en-
titled to a fair return upon the fair and reasonable value of all of its plant and property then used and useful in the public service, but we submit that the fair and reasonable value of a public utility's plant and property is not to be ascertained by adopting only one method of valuation to the exclusion of all other known methods and elements of value. A valuation of a public utility, such as would be fair to the public as well as the utility, should take into consideration the original cost or investment in the utility; the market value of its stocks or bonds, if any; the probable earning capacity of the property; the various rates it has received and the rate it is receiving;
the amounts necessary to meet operating expenses; the ability of the utility to adequately perform the public service; the history of the operations of the utility; and perhaps other elements; and after taking all bf these into consideration, fix a value that will be fair both to the public and to the utility.

262 U. S.

If by taking one element or method of value a conclusion is reached which is out of all proportion with a conclusion that may be reached by taking other methods, then that measure or method should be adopted which will, after taking into consideration all of the elements of value, make a fair and reasonable value on the utility's property, used and useful in the public service.
The reproduction theory of public utility valuation has been usually resorted to by the public to safeguard itself against values of public utilities, based upon inflated and watered stock investments, purporting to represent original cost. Practically all, if not all, of the decisions of this Court, in which this theory of valuation was even considered, were cases of this character; and even in them this Court has never held that the reproduction new theory at present prices was an exclusive method by which public utility values are to be determined. Smyth v. Ames, supra;Whitten, Valuation Public Service Corporations, c. V, p. 82, et seq.; 2 Wyman, Public Service Corporations, c. 32; Coal & Coke Ry. Co. v. Conley, 67 W. Va. 129; Minnesota Rate Cases, 230 U. S. 352.
If determining public utility values for rate-making purposes is to be accomplished by using the reproduction new theory at present prices, to the exclusion of every other element and method of values, then it may well be seen to what uncertain, as well as unfair, consequences it may lead. If the market is abnormally low and a valuation on this theory is made at such a time, without taking into consideration past costs or other elements of value, it would be manifestly unfair to the utility. Likewise, if this theory of valuation is used at a time of abnormally high prices in the market, such as was produced by the World War, and all other methods and elements of values are excluded, then it would be most unfair to the public, who would be expected to pay rates

MR. JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.
Plaintiff in error is a corporation furnishing water to
the city of Bluefield, West Virginia, and its inhabitants. September 27, 1920, the Public Service Commission of the State being authorized by statute to fix just and reasonable rates, made its order prescribing rates. In accordance with the laws of the State (§ 16, c. 15-0, Code of West Virginia) the company instituted proceedings in the Supreme Court of Appeals to suspend and set aside the order. The petition alleges that the order is repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment, and deprives the company of its property without just compensation and without due process of law and denies it equal protection of the laws. A final judgment was entered denying the company relief and dismissing its petition. The case is here on writ of error.
1. The city moves to dismiss the writ of error for the reason, as it asserts, that there was not drawn in question the validity of a statute or an authority exercised under the State, on the ground of repugnancy to the Federal Constitution.
The validity of the order prescribing the rates was directly challenged on constitutional grounds, and it was held valid by the highest court of the State. The prescribing of rates is a legislative act. The commission is an instrumentality of the State, exercising delegated powers. Its order is of the same force as would be a like enactment by the legislature. If, as alleged, the prescribed rates are confiscatory, the order is void. Plaintiff in error is entitled to bring the case here on writ of error and to have that question decided by this Court. The motion to dismiss will be denied. See Oklahoma Natural Gas Co. v.

Russell, 261 U. S. 290, and cases cited; also Ohio Valley Water Co. v. Ben Avon Borough, 253 U. S. 287.
2. The commission fixed $460,000 as the amount on

which the company is entitled to a return. It found that
under existing rates, assuming some increase of business, gross earnings for 1921 would be $80,000 and operating expenses $53,000, leaving $27,000, the equivalent of 5.87 per cent., or 3.87 per cent. after deducting 2 per cent. allowed for depreciation. It held existing rates insufficient to the extent of $10,000. Its order allowed the company to add 16 per cent. to all bills, excepting those for public and private fire protection. The total of the bills so to be increased amounted to $64,000. That is, 80 per
cent. of the revenue was authorized to be increased 16 per cent., equal to an increase of 12.8 per cent. on the.
total,-amounting to $10,240. As to value. The company claims that the value of the
property is greatly in excess of $460,000. Reference to the evidence is necessary. There was submitted to the commission evidence of value which it summarized sub-

stantially as follows:

a. Estimate by company's engineer on

basis of reproduction new, less depreciation, at prewar prices ....... b. Estimate by company's engineer on

ciation at 1915 prices, plus additions since December 31, 1915, at actual

cost, excluding Bluefield Valley Water Works, water rights and

It was shown that the prices prevailing in 1920 were nearly double those in 1915 and prewar time. The company did not claim value as high as its estimate of cost of construction in 1920. Its valuation engineer testified that in his opinion the value of the property was $900,000,-a figure between the cost of construction in 1920, less depreciation, and the cost of construction in 1915 and before the war, less depreciation.
The commission's application of the evidence may be stated briefly as follows:
As to " a ", supra. The commission deducted $204,000 from the estimate (details printed in the margin),' leaving approximately $421,000 which it contrasted with the estimate of its own engineer, $397,964.38 (see "d", supra). It found that there should be included $25,000 for the Bluefield Valley Water Works plant in Virginia, 10 per cent. for going value, and $10,000 for working capital. If these be added to $421,000 there results $500,600. This may be compared with the commission's final figure, $460,000.

262 U. S.

As to "b" and "c", supra. These were given no weight by the commission in arriving at its final figure, $460,000. It said:
"Applicant's plant was originally constructed more than twenty years ago, and has been added to from time to time as the progress and development of the community required. For this reason, it would be unfair to its consumers to use as a basis for present fair value the abnormal prices prevailing during the recent war period, but when, as in this case, a part of the plant has been constructed or added to during that period, in fairness to the applicant, consideration must be given to the cost of such expenditures made to meet the demands of the public."
As to "d", supra, The commission taking $400,000 (round figures) added $25,000 for Bluefield Valley Water Works plant in Virginia, 10 per cent. for going value, and $10,000 for working capital, making $477,500. This may be compared with its final figure, $460,000.
As to "e", supra. The commission on the report of its statistician found gross investment to be $500,402.53. Its engineer applying the straight line method found 19 per cent. depreciation. It applied 81 per cent. to gross investment and added 10 per cent. for going value and $10,000 for working capital, producing $455,500.2 This may be compared with its final figure, $460,000.
As to "f",supra. It is necessary briefly to explain how this figure, $452,520.53, was arrived at. Case No. 368 was a proceeding initiated by the application of the company for higher rates, April 24, 1915. The commission made a valuation as of January 1, 1915. There were presented two estimates of reproduction cost less depreciation, one by a valuation engineer engaged by the com-
3As to "e". $365,445.13 represents investment cost less deprecia-
tion. The gross investment was found to be $500,402.53, indicating a deduction on account of depreciation of $134,957.40, about 27 per cent. as against 19 per cent. found by the commission's engineer.

BLUEFIELD CO. v. PUB. SERV. COMM. 687

Opinion of the Court.

pany and the other by a valuation engineer engaged by the city, both "using the same method." An inventory made by the company's engineer was accepted as correct by the city and by the commission. The method "was that generally employed by courts and commis-
sions in arriving at the value of public utility properties under this method", and in both estimates "five year average unit prices " were applied. The estimate of the company's engineer was $540,000 and of the city's engineer, $392,000. The principal differences as given by the commission are shown ii the margin.' The commission disregarded both estimates and arrived at $360,000. It held that the best basis of valuation was the net investment, i. e., the total cost of the property less depreciation. It said: "The books of the company show a total gross investment since its organization, of $407,882.00, and that there has been charged off for depreciation from year to year the total sum of $83,445.00, leaving a net investment of $324,427.00. . . . From an examination of the books . . . it appears that the records of the company have been remarkably well kept and preserved. It, therefore, seems that when a plant is developed under these conditions the net investment which of course means the total gross investment less depreciation is the very best basis of valuation for rate making purposes and that the other methods above referred to should

be used only when it is impossible to arrive at the true investment. Therefore, after making due allowance for capital necessary for the conduct of the business and considering the plant as a going concern, it is the opinion of the commission that the fair value for the purpose of
determining reasonable and just rates in this case of the property of the applicant company, used by it in the public service of supplying water to the City of Bluefield and its citizens, is the sum of $360,000.00, which sum is hereby fixed and determined by the Commission to be the fair present value for the said purpose of determining the reasonable and just rates in this case."
In its report in No. 368, the commission did not indicate the amounts respectively allowed for going value or working capital. If 10 per cent. be added for the former, and $10,000 for the latter (as fixed by the commission in the present case) there is produced $366,870, to be compared with $360,000, found by the commission in its valuation as of January 1, 1915. To this it added $92,520.53 expended since, producing $452,520.53. This may be compared with its final figure, $460,000.
The State Supreme Court of Appeals holds that the valuing of the property of a public utility corporation and prescribing rates are purely legislative acts not subject to judicial review except in so far as may be necessary to determine whether such rates are void on constitutional or other grounds; and that findings of fact by the commission based on evidence to support them will not be reviewed by the court. Bluefield v. Water Works Co., 81 W. Va. 201, 204; Coal and Coke Co. v. Public Service Commission, 84 W. Va. 662, 678; Charleston v. Public Service Commission, 86 W. Va. 536.
In this case (89 W. Va. 736) it said (p. 738): "From the written opinion of the commission we find that it ascertained the value of the petitioner's property for rate making [then quoting the commission] 'after

BLUEFIELD CO. v. PUB. SERV. COMM. 689

679

Opinion of the Court.

maturely and carefully considering the various methods presented for the ascertainment of .fair value and giving such weight as seems proper to every element involved and all the facts and circumstances disclosed by the record.'"
The record clearly shows that the commission in arriving at its final figure did not accord proper, if any, weight to the greatly enhanced costs of construction in 1920 over those prevailing about 1915 and before the war, as established by uncontradicted evidence; and the company's detailed estimated cost of reproduction new, less depreciation, at 1920 prices, appears to have been wholly disregarded. This was erroneous. Missouri ex rel. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. PublicService Commission, ante, 276. Plaintiff in error is entitled under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the independent judgment of the court as to both law and facts. Ohio Valley Water Co. v. Ben Avon Borough, 253 U. S. 287, 289, and cases cited.
We quote further from the court's opinion (pp. 739, 740):
"In our opinion the commission was justified by the law and by the facts in finding as a basis for rate making the sum of $460,000.00 . . In our case of Coal & Coke Ry. Co. v. Conley, 67 W. Va. 129, it is said: 'It seems to be generally held that, in the absence of peculiar and extraordinary conditions, such as a more costly plant than the public service of the community requires, or the erection of a plant at an actual, though extravagant, cost, or the purchase of one at an exorbitant or inflated price, the actual amount of money invested is to be taken as the basis, and upon this a return must be allowed equivalent to that which is ordinarily received in the locality in which the business is done, upon capital invested in similar enterprises. In addition to this, consideration must be given to the nature of the investment, a higher rate

being regarded as justified by the risk incident to a hazardous investment.' ·
"That the original cost considered in connection with
the history and growth of the utility and the value of the services rendered constitute the principal elements to be considered in connection with rate making, seems to be supported by nearly all the authorities."
The question in the case is whether the rates prescribed in the commission's order are confiscatory and therefore beyond legislative power. Rates which are not sufficient to yield a reasonable return on the value of the property used at the time it is being used to render the service are unjust, unreasonable and confiscatory, and their enforcement deprives the public utility company of its property in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. This is so well settled by numerous decisions of this Court that citation of the cases is scarcely necessary. "What the company is entitled to ask is a fair return upon the value of that which it employs for the public convenience." Smyth v. Ames, (1898) 169 U. S. 466, 547.
"There must be a fair return upon the reasonable value of the property at the time it is being used for the public. .
"And we concur with the court below in holding that the value of the property is to be determined as of the time when the inquiry is made regarding the rates. If the property, which legally enters into the consideration of the question of rates, has increased in value since it was acquired, the company is entitled to the benefit of such increase." Willcox v. ConsolidatedGas Co., (1909) 212 U. S. 19, 41, 52.
"The ascertainment of that value is not controlled by artificial rules. It is not a matter of formulas, but there must be a reasonable judgment having its basis in a proper consideration of all relevant facts." Minnesota Rate Cases, (1913) 230 U. S. 352, 434.

"And in order to ascertain that value, the original cost of construction, the amount expended in permanent improvements, the amount and market value of its bonds
and stock, the present as compared with the original cost of construction, the probable earning capacity of the
property *underparticular rates prescribed by statute, and the sum required to meet operating expenses, are all matters for consideration, and are to be given such weight
as may be just and right in each case. We do not say that there may not be other matters to be regarded in estimating the value of the property." Smyth v. Ames, supra, 546, 547.
" . ... The making of a just return for the use of
the property involves the recognition of its fair value if it be more than its cost. The property is held in private ownership and it is that property, and not the original cost of it, of which the owner may not be deprived without due process of law." Minnesota Rate Cases,
supra, 454. In Missouri ex rel. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v.
Public Service Commission, supra, applying the principles of the cases above cited and others, this Court said:
"Obviously; the Commission undertook to value the property without according any weight to the greatly
enhanced costs of material, labor, supplies, etc., over those prevailing in 1913, 1914 and 1916. As matter of common knowledge, these increases were large. Competent witnesses estimated them as 45 to 50 per centum
S.It is impossible to ascertain what will amount to a fair return upon properties devoted to public service without giving consideration to the cost of labor, supplies, etc., at the time the investigation is made. An honest and intelligent forecast of probable future values made upon a view of all the relevant circumstances, is essential. If the highly important element of present costs is wholly disregarded such a forecast becomes impossible. Estimates for to-morrow cannot ignore prices of today."

It is clear that the court also failed to give proper consideration to the higher cost of construction in 1920 over that in 1915 and before the war, and failed to give weight to cost of reproduction less depreciation on the basis of 1920 prices, or to the testimony of the company's valua-
tion engineer, based on present and past costs of construction, that the property in his opinion, was worth $900,000. The final figure, $460,000, was arrived at substantially on the basis of actual cost less depreciation plus ten per cent. for going value and $10,000 for working capital. . This resulted in a valuation considerably and materially less than would have been reached by a fair and just consideration of all the facts. The valuation cannot be sustained. Other objections to the valuation need not be considered.
3. Rate of return. The state commission found that
the company's net annual income should be approximately $37,000, in order to enable it to earn 8 per cent. for return and depreciation upon the value of its property as fixed by it. Deducting 2 per cent. for depreciation, there remains 6 per cent. on $460,000, amounting to $27,600 for return. This was approved, by the state
court. The company contends that the rate of return is too
low and confiscatory. What annual rate will constitute just compensation depends upon many circumstances and must be determined by the exercise of a fair and enlightened judgment, having regard to all relevant facts. A public utility is entitled to such rates as will permit it
to earn a return on the value of the property which it employs for the convenience of the public equal to that generally being made at the same time and in the same general part of the country on investments in other business undertakings which are attended by corresponding risks and uncertainties; but it has no constitutional right to profits such as are realized or anticipated in

highly profitable enterprises or speculative ventures. The return should be reasonably sufficient to assure confidence in the financial soundness of the utility and should be adequate, under efficient and economical management, to maintain and support its credit and enable it to raise the money necessary for the proper discharge of its public duties. A rate of return may be reasonable at one time and become too high or too low by changes affecting opportunities for investment, the money market and business conditions generally.
In 1909, this Court, in Willcox v. ConsolidatedGas Co., 212 U. S. 19, 48-50, held that the question whether a rate yields such a return as not to be confiscatory depends upon circumstances, locality and risk, and that no proper rate can be established for all cases; and that, under the circumstances of that case, 6 per cent. was a fair return on the value of the property employed in supplying gas to the City of New York, and that a rate yielding that return was not confiscatory. In that case the investment was held to be safe, returns certain and risk reduced almost to a minimum-as nearly a safe and secure investment as could be imagined in regard to any private manufacturing enterprise.
In 1912, in Cedar Rapids Gas Light Co. v. Cedar Rapids, 223 U. S. 655, 670, this Court declined to reverse the state court where the value of the plant considerably exceeded its cost, and the estimated return was over 6
per cent. In 1915, in Des Moines Gas Co. v. Des Moines, 238
U. S. 153, 172, this Court declined to reverse the United States District Court in refusing an injunction upon the conclusion reached that a return of 6 per cent. per annum upon the value would not be confiscatory.
In 1919, this Court in Lincoln Gas Co. v. Lincoln, 250 U. S. 256, 268, declined on the facts of that case to approve a finding that no rate yielding as much as 6 per

cent. on the invested capital could be regarded as confiscatory. Speaking for the Court, Mr. Justice Pitney said:
"It is a matter of common knowledge that, owing principally to the world war, the costs of labor and supplies of every kind have greatly advanced since the ordinance was adopted, and largely since this cause was last heard in the court below. And it is equally well known that annual returns upon capital and enterprise the world over have materially increased, so that what would have been a proper rate of return for capital invested in gas plants and similar public Utilities a few years ago furnishes no safe criterion for the present or for the future."
In 1921, in Brush Electric Co. v. Galveston, the United States District Court held 8 per cent. a fair rate of return.'
In January, 1923, in Minneapolis v. Rand, the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Eighth Circuit (285 Fed. 818, 830) sustained, as against the attack of the city on the ground that it was excessive, 71/2 per cent., found by a special master and approved by the District Court as a fair and reasonable return on the capital investmentthe value of the property.
Investors take into account the result of past operations, especially in recent years, when determining the terms upon which they will invest in such an undertaking. Low, uncertain or irregular income makes for low prices for the securities of the utility and higher rates of interest to be demanded by investors. The fact that the company may not insist as a matter of constitutional right that past losses be made up by rates to be applied in the present and future tends to weaken credit, and the fact that the utility is protected against being compelled to serve for confiscatory rates tends to support it. In

Syllabus.

this case the record shows that the rate of return has been low through a long period up to the time of the inquiry by the commission here involved. For example, the average rate of return on the total cost of the property from 1895 to 1915, inclusive, was less than 5 per cent.; from 1911 to 1915, inclusive, about 4.4 per cent., without allowance for depreciation. In 1919 the net operating income was approximately $24,700, leaving $15,500, approximately, or 3.4 per cent. on $460,000 fixed by the commission, after deducting 2 per cent. for depreciation. In 1920, the net operating income was approximately $25,465, leaving $16,265 for return, after allowing for depreciation. Under the facts and circumstances indicated by the record, we think that a rate of return of 6 per cent. upon the value of the property is substantially too low to constitute just compensation for the use of the property employed to render the service.
The judgment of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia is reversed.

MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS concurs in the judgment of reversal for the reasons stated by him in Missouri ex rel. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Service Commission of Missouri, supra.
