Decided on authcrity of InternationalTextbook Co. v. Pigg, 217 U. S. 91.
Mr. David C. Harringtonfor plaintiff in error.
No briefs filed for defendants in error.
Per Curiam: Substantially the same question of Federal law involved in these two cases arose under a Kansas statute in International Textbook Co. v. Pigg, 217 U. S. 91;' and the Federal right asserted in that case was sustained. There is no difference in principle between the two cases last named 'and the Pigg case, although the Federal question involved in them arises under the statutes, respectively, of other States-Wisconsin and Vermont. In view of the pleadings and the conceded facts in these cases the judgment in each of them must be reversed on the authority of the Pigg case, and the cases sre severally remanded for such further proceedings as is required by and is not inconsistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

PROCEEDINGS ON THE DEATH OF
SUPREME -COURT OF THE UNITED STATES.
TUESDAY, MAY 31, 1910.
Present: THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, MR. JUSTICE WHITE, MR. JUSTICE MCKENNA, MR. JUSTICE HOLMES, MR. JUSTICE DAY and MR. JUSTICE LUR-
TON.
The Attorney General addressed the court as follows:
May it please the court, at the request of the Bar of this court I present the following resolutions adopted at a meeting held in this court room:
"Resolved, That the Bar of the Supreme Court of the United States deeply deplores the death of the late David J. Brewer, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, and desires to place upon record an expression of the respect and esteem in which JUSTICE BREWER was held and of regret for the loss which the Court, the Bar, and the country have suffered in his untimely death.
"His judicial career was one of exceptional length and of marked distinction and success. Elected judge of the District Court of the First Judicial District of the State of Kansas in 1864; three times elected a justice of the Supreme Court of the State of Kansas; appointed in 1884 judge of the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eighth Circuit; appointed a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States in December, 1889, it will be observed that for nearly fifty years he discharged the high and sacred duties of a judge. In this long service, in the'vast number of opinions which he wrote, the infinite variety of legal principles considered and treated, the learning and wisdom displayed, the consecration and fidelity ever and always evidenced, will be found his only fitting eulogy.

MR. JUSTICE BREWER.
His remarkable grasp of the underlying principles upon which our whole structure of government rests, his unswerving fidelity to the fixed rules of order and stability so esseitial and so often sorely tested, his strong, positive, upright, fearless character, his power of sustained intellectual effort, place him easily among the great judges of his day and time. No one ever doubted his purity of life, his integrity of purpose, and all who read and consider his legal opinions pay homage to his profound intellect. Those who knew him are quick to testify to his tender and considerate nature, and those who must be content to find his character in his opinions scattered through many State, Circuit, and Supreme Court decisions will never doubt his probity or his power as a jurist.
"Resolved, That The Attorney General be asked to present these resolutions to the court with the request that they be entered upon the records and that the chairman of this meeting be directed to send to the family of the late JUSTICE BREWER a copy of the resolutions and an expression of our sympathy for them in the loss which they have sustained."
JUSTICE BREWER'S period of service in this court covered twenty years. These two decades brought before this court some of the most important and farreaching questions which have ever been submitted for its decision, and in the- solution of these great problems JUSTICE BREWER took a leading part. In the. reports of this period there are to be found 719 opinions. written by JUSTICE BREWER, in 157 of which he dissented from the conclusions of the majority of the court. The limitations of this occasion will permit only a brief reference to a few decisions: which illustrate the characteristics of his. mind and the lucidity of his exposition.
One of. the earliest of his recorded opinions was that in the case of the Church of the Holy .Trinity v. United States, 143 U. S. 457, w.here the court was called upon to decide

x

PROCEEDINGS ON THE DEATH OF

whether or not the act prohibiting the importation of foreigners and aliens under contract to perform labor in the United States applied to an English Christian minister who had come to the United States pursuant to an agreement with a Protestant Episcopal Church in the city of New York. The opinion is of especial interest, not merely as a fine discriminating construction of the statute, and the application of the principle that laws must receive a sensible construction, and that where a literal construction leads to an absurd conclusion the letter of the law must give way to the presumed intention of the legislature; but because of the enunciation of the principle that "no purpose of action against religion can be imputed to any legislation, state or national, because this is a religious people."

"If we examine the constitutions of the various States,"

said the learned justice, "we find in them a constant

recognition of religious obligations. Every constitution

of every one of the forty-four States contains language

which either directly or by clear implication recognizes a

profound reverence for religion and an assumption that

its influence in all human affairs is essential to the well-

being of the community.

"There is no dissonance in these declarations. There' is a universal language pervading them all, having one meaning; they affirm and reaffirm that this is a religious nation. These are not individual sayings, declarations of private persons; they are organic utterances; they speak the voiceof the entire people.

"These, and many other matters which might be noticed, add a volume of unofficial declarations to the mass of organic utterances that this is a Christian nation. In the face of all these, shall it be believed that a Congress
t the [thiled States intenled to make it a misdenwaiior

MR. JUSTICE BREWER.
for a church of this country to contract for the services of a Christian mihister residing in another nation?"
In the case of Kansas v. Colorado, 206 U. S. 46, perhaps one of the most important decisions in which MR. JtsTICE BREWER wrote the opinion of the court, he was called upon to deaf with riparian rights and to determine whether or not one State has the right to the continuous flow of the waters of a river flowing to itthrough an adjoining State, or whether the latter State has the right to so appropriate its waters as to prevent such continuous flow; and whether the amount of the flow is subject to the superior authority and supervisory control of the United States.
In considering at theoutget the foundations of the jurisdiction of this court over controversies between States, JUSTICE BREWER laid down the proposition that the judi. cial power of a nation extends to all controversies justiciable in their nature, the parties to which or the property involved in which may be reached by judicial process, and when the judicial power of the United States was vested in the Supreme and other couits .all the judicial power which the nation was capable of exercising was vested in those tribunals, and unless there be some limitations expressed in the Constitution it must be held to embrace all controversies of a justiciable nature arising within the territorial limits of the nation, no matter who may be the parties thereto.
"These considerations," he said, "lead to 'the proposition that when a legislative power is claimed for the National Government the question is whether that power is one of those granted by the Constitution, either in terms of by necessarSy implication, whereas in respect to judicial functions the question is whether there -be any limitations expressed in the Constitution on the general grant of national power."
One of the ablest opinions of MR. JUSTICE BREWER is

xii

PROCEEDINGS ON THE DEATH OF

that iri the case of In re Debs, Petitioner, 158 U. S. 564, in which he expressed the unanimous views of the court in affirming that, the relations of the general government to interstate commerce and the transportation of the mails are such as to authorize a direct interference to prevent
n obstruction thereto, and that a court of equity has jurisdiction to issue an injunction in aid of the performance of such duty.
Perhaps in no other opinion of this court is there a better summary of the principles upon which rests the power of the Federal Government to maintain its sovereignty than that with which JUSTICE BREWER concludes his opinion in this case:

We hold that the Government of the United .States is one having jurisdiction over every foot of.,soil within its territory, and acting directly upon each citizen; tlat while it is a government of enumerated powers, it has within the limits of those powers all the attributes of sovereignty; that to it is committed power over interstate commerce and the transmission of the mail; that the powers thus conferred upon the National Government are not dormant, but have been assumed and put into practical exercise by the legislation of Congress; that in the exercise of those powers it is competent for the nation to remove all obstructions upon highways, natural or artificial, to the passage of interstate commerce or the carrying of the mail; that while it may be competent for the Government (through the executive branch and in the use of the entire executive power of the nation) to forcibly remove all such obstructions, it is equally within iAs competency to appeal to the civil courts for an inquiry and determination as to the existence and character of any alleged obstructions, and if such are found to exist or threaten to occur, to invoke the powers of those courts to removeor restrain such obstructions; that the jurisdiction of courts to interfere in such matters by injunction is one

MR. JUSTICE BREWER.
recognized from ancient times and by indubitable authority."
JusTic, BREWER was always noted as a man of deep religious conviction. * We have seen that one of the first questions which he was called upon to'deal with after his elevation to the Supreme Court involved the relation between religion and the National Government. He was keenly interested in the position of woman in our modern society, and one of the latest of his decisions (Muller v. State of Oregon, 208 U. S. 412) involved the right of a State to regulate the working hours of women. After reviewing the laws of Oregon, he observed:
"It thus appears that, putting to one side the elective franchise, in the matter of personal and contractual rights they stand on the same plane as the other sex. Their rights in these respects can no more be infringed than the equal rights of their brothers."
Yet he held, and in so doing voiced the unanimous opinion of this court-
"That woman's physical structure and the performance .of maternal functions place her at a disadvantage in the struggle for subsistence is obvious. This is especially true when the burdens of motherhood are upon her. Even when they are not, by abundant testimony of the medical fraternity, continuance for a long time on her feet at work, repeating that from day to day, tends to injurious effects upon the body, and as healthy mothers are essential to vigorous offspring the physical well-being of woman becomes an object of public interest and care in order to preserve the strength and vigor of the race.
"Still, again, history discloses the fact that woman has always been dependent upon man. He established his control at the outset bv superior physical strength, and

PROCEEDINGS ON THE DEATH OF
this control, in various forms, with diminishing intensity, has continued to the present. . . . Education was long denied her, and while now the doors of the schoolroom are opened and her opportunities for acquiring knowledge are great, yet even with that and the consequent increase of capacity for business affairs it is still true that in the struggle for subsistence she is not an equal competitor with her brother. Though limitations upon personal and contractual rights may be removed by legislation, there is that in her disposition and habits of life which will operate against a full assertion of those rights. She will still be where some legislation to protect her seems necessary to secure a real equality of right."
Your honors know better than any but his immediate family the personal qualities which endeared JUSTICE BREWER alike to his associates on the Bench, to his friends, and to the Bar. Nothing better can be said of any man, however high his place or great his deeds, than that throughout his life he was not only esteemed, but beloved of all who knew him, and, indeed, that praise is greater in proportion as exalted station and high career tend to isolate from one's fellows. JUSTICE BREWER everywhere and always won affection. It was so in his life at the university. His activities as a judge of his adopted State, Kansas, and then as judge of the United States for the largest circuit in the country, were made easier and more effective by the warm and lasting regard of his Bar; and when advancement to this court widened his contact from the lawyers of the West to the lawyers and, indeed, to the people, of the nation, he soon gained the love of his countrymen generally, and it remained with him to the end. Reasons need not be sought. They would hnot be difficult-to find or to declare, but such continued and ever extending hold upon the hearts of men proves, without analysii, the worth and beauty of the personality that' gains it.

MR. JUSTICE BREWER.
JUSTICE BREWER.Was a son of a Christian missionary, and the son's life, like the father's, was oneiof service. For six and forty years he served the people, hearing causes and judging "righteously between every man- and his brother and the stranger that is with him." And in the discharge of his great office he did ever obey the injunction laid unon the Judges of Israel by their great lawgiver:
"Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall. hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man, for the judgment is Gbd's." (1 Deut. 17.)
THE CHIEF JUSTICE responded as follows:
During the years of my occupancy of a seat upon-this Bench it has been my sad duty to accept for the court tributes of the Bar in memory of many members of this tribunal who have passed to their reward. As .our BROTHER BREWER joins the great procession, there pass before me the forms of Matthews and Miller, of Field and Bradley and Lamar and Blatchford, of Jackson and Gray and of Peckham, whose works follow them now that they rest from their labors. They were air men of marked ability, of untiring industry, and of intense devotion to duty, but .they were not alike. They differed as "one star differeth from another star in glory." Their names will remain illustrious in the annals of jurisprudence. And now we are called on to deplore the departure of one of the most lovable of them all.
He died suddenly, but not the unprepared death from which we pray to be delivered. When the unexpected intelligence was conveyed to me I could not but think of Mrs. Barbauld's poem on "Life," and seemed to hear our dear friend exclaim-
IThese remarks were deivered on the last day that Ma. CHIEF Jus-
T'ck FULLER presided over the court. October Term, 1909, adjourned the same day, and during vacation the Chief Justice (lied at hie summer home in Sorrento, Maine, on July 4, 1910.

MR. JUSTICE BREWER.
"Life! we've been long together, Through pleasant and through cloudy weather; 'Tis hard to part when friends are dear; Perhaps 'twill cost a sigh, a tear; Then steal away, give little warning, Choose thine own time; Say not, Good night, but in some brighter clime .Bid me, Good morning."
The resolutiops of our Bar and the discriminating remarks of the Attorney General adequately cover the magnificent judicial labors of MR. JUSTICE BREWER, but it is the ineffable sweetness of his disposition that chiefly impresses itself upon me and is indicated by the serenity of the verse I have quoted.
He was a truly eloquent man. The fountain of tears and the fountain of laughter ran close together and carried the hearer away upon the mingled current of their waters. And like Mr. Lincoln, he evidently found great comfort from the inevitable trials and tribulations of the world in the humorous anecdotes which brought the relief of merriment.
But I cannot prolong these remarks. The resolutions and the observations of the Attorney General will be spread upon our records.

"SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED bTATES,
"Washington, D. C., November 23, 1910. "DEAR BROTHER MOODY: We can not let you leave us without an expression of our deep regret. The too few years during which we sat together on the bench already had confirmed the prophecy of your arguments at the bar. They had proved that your unusual powers would be applied as faithfully and impartially to dispassionate decision as, when you were Attorney General, they had been devoted to an always lofty presentation of a side. We grieve that the country so soon should lose services that it ill can spare and we companionship in which affection was joined to respect. But you have left a sample of your work in the reports, and, we believe, have earned the

APPEAL AND ERROR. 1. Appeal; sufficiency of statement of facts. Where the trial court makes findings of fact and states conclusions of
law thereon but certifies no rulings in respect of evidence, and the Supreme Court of the Territory enters a general judgment of affirmance, manifestly based upon the correctness of such findings of fact, they furnish a sufficient statement for the appeal; and, in this court, the question is whether they are sufficient to support the decree. (Stringfellow v. Cain, 99 U. S. 610.) Montezuma Canal Co. v. Smithville Canal Co., 371.

Where the trustee in bankruptcy brings a bill in equity in the Circuit Court to set aside a transfer made by the bankrupt, the appeal is not governed by § 25 of the Bankruptcy Act but by the Court of Appeals Act of March 3,18911 c. 517, § 6, 26 Stat. 828. (Knapp v. Milwaukee Trust Co., 216 U. S. 545.) Thomas v. Sugarman, 129.
2. Ratification of bankrupt's act and election of remedy by trustee; what amounts to.
The fact that a trustee in bankruptcy obtained a money judgment against one to whom the bankrupt transferred certain assets to delay and defraud creditors, held, in this case, not to have amounted to ratificatibn of the bankrupt's act or to an election not to pursue the assets transferred, but the bankrupt was entitled to also maintain a bill in equity to set aside the transfer. 1b.

Jennings v. Phila.,Balto. & Wash. Ry. Co., 255.
2. Allowance; implicationof consent. Grave matters of procedure such as the allowance of a bill of excep-
tions after close of the term should not rest on mere implication of consent. Ib.

CLAIMS AGAINST THE UNITED STATES. 1. Assignment of-What claims within prohibition of § 8477, Rev. Stat. The prohibition of § 3477, Rev. Stat., against assignment of claims
against the United States which have not been allowed and warrant issued therefor is of universal application. It covers all unallowed claims and all voluntary assignments thereof, including assignments made in good faith, as security for advances in course of business, of undisputed claims on contracts being performed by the assignor; and held, that assignments of such claims so made by a bankrupt are null and void, not only as against the United States but also as against other creditors, and the claims pass by operation of law to the trustee in bankruptcy. National Bank of Commerce v. Downie, 345.
2. Assignment of; claims not within prohibitionof § 3477, Rev. Stat. Section 3477, Rev. Stat., does not embrace the transfer of unallowed
claims against the United States when the transfer is by operation of law and not voluntary. Ib.
3. Assignment of; effect of xempting certain claims from operation of § 3477, Rev. Stat.
To hold that an act making all assignments of claims against the Government null and void does not embrace claims and assignments of the nature of those involved in this action would effect a repeal of the statute by judicial iegislation in disregard of its plain intent. 1b.

4. Right of executive officer to bind Government in excess of appropriation. Heads of departments cannot by express or implied contract render
the Government liable for an amount in excess of that expressly appropriated by Congress for the subject-matter of the contract. Hooe v. United States, 322.
5. Unauthorized claims not founded on Constitution. A claim against the United States for a specific amount of money
which is not expressly or by necessary implication authorized by a valid enactment of Congress cannot be said to be founded on the Constitution. lb.
6. Liability'ofGovernment for use of private property made without authority of law.
When an officer of the United States takes or uses private property without authority of law he creates no condition under which the Government is liable by reason of its constitutional duty to make compensation. If private property has been taken or used by an officer of the United States without authority of law the remedy is not with the courts but with Congress alone. lb.
7. Jurisdictionof Court of Claims of such claim. A claim for such compensation does not rest on the Constitution, and
as an unauthorized act of the officer *does not create a claim against the United States, the Court of Claims has no jurisdiction thereof under the Tucker Act of March 3, i887, d. 359, 24 Stat. 505. lb.
8. Right of lessor of building to recover amount in excess of appropriation made for use thereof.
One renting a building to a department of the Government and receiring the entire appropriation for rent for such department has no claim against the Government for any amount in excess of the appropriation, even though he demands more and though he expressly excepts a part of the building from the lease and the department actually occupies the part reserved, nor has the Court of Claims jurisdiction of such a claim as one arising under the provision of the Constitution that private property shall not be taken without compensation. lb.

CLERKS OF COURT. 1. Embezzlement by; act of March 8, 1875, and §§ 5490, 5497, Rev. Stat.,
not applicable as respects fees of. Clerks of the Federal courts are not controlled in respect to their fees
and emoluments and accounting therefor by the provisions of the act of March 3, 1875, c. 144, 18 Stat. 479, or of Rev. Stat., §§ 5490 and 5497, relating to embezzlement of moneys and property of the United States by officers and other persons charged with the safekeeping thereof. United States v. Mason, 517.
2. Fees of, as property of the United States; nature offees. There is a separate system with respect to the fees and emoluments of
clerks, and the amounts *hich the clerk receives are not moneys or property of the United States but a fund from which he receives his compensation and expenses, and as to the surplus for which hd must account to the United States he is not trustee but debtor. lb.

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW. 1. Commerce clause; inseparfible incidents of interstate commerce within. The protection of the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution
extends beyond the strict lines of contract, and inseparable incidents of a transaction of interstate commerce based on contract are also interstate commerce. Dozier-v. Aiabama, 124.
2. Commerce clause; incident of contract within provisionof. Where, under the contract to purchase a picture, the purchaser has
the option to take at a specified price the frame in which the picture shall be delivered, and both picture and frame are manufactured in'and delivered from another State and remain the property of the vendor until paid for, the sale of the frame is a part of the original transaction and protected by the commerce clause of the Constitution. Ib.
3. Commerce clause; imposition of license tax as burden on inter8tate commerce; repugnancyof Alabama statute of March 7, 1907, §17.
The imposition of a license tax for soliciting orders for enlargements of photographs and frames on persons not having a permanent place of business in the.State and keeping such articles as stock in trade is a regulation of commerce between the States and void under'the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution, both as to the orders for the picture itself and as to an optional right to take, at a price specified in the contract, the frama in which the picture is delivered, and so held as to the license tax imposed under § 17 of the statute of March 7, 1907, of Alabama. lb.
4. Commerce clause; burden on interstate commerce; stoppage of trains constituting.
Where a railroad company has already provided adequate accommodation at any point, a state regulation requiring interstate trains to stop at such point is an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce and void under. the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution, and..this rule equally applies to junction, as to other, points; and so held as to the act 3f March 19, 1907, amending

5. Commerce clause; what constitutes burden on interstatecommerce. While a state statute which imposes positive duties and regulates the
performance of business of a telegraph company is void as a direct regulation of interstate commerce as decided in Western Un. Tel. Co. v. Pendleton, 122 U. S. 347, a statute which imposes no additional duty but gives sanction only to an inherent duty and declares, as to a public service, the public policy of the State, does not entail any burden on interstate commerce and is not void under the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States. Western Union Tel. Co. Y. Commercial Milling Co., 406.
6. Commerce clause;validity of prohibitionaffecting; materialityof source of prohibition.
Whether a prohibition affecting interstate commerce as construed by the highest court of a State rests on the common-law liability or on a statute of that State makes no difference ia determining its validity under the Constitution of the United,States. lb.
7. Commerce clause-Validity of Michigan law of 1893 fixing liability of telegraph companies.
The statute of Michigan of 1893, fixing the liability of telegraph companies for non-delivery of messages at the damages sustained by the sender, is not, as applied to interstate messages, unconstitutional as a burden on, or regulation of, interstate commerce, or as depriving telegraph companies of their property without due process of law or denying them the equal protection of the laws. Ib.
8. Contractclause; contractswithin. The contract clause of the Federal Constitution does not give validity
to contracts that are properly prohibited by statute. Griffith v. Connecticut, 563.
9. Contract impairment; effect of exemption from taxation on previous contractfor taxationin aid of railroad.
Even if the vote by a parish acting under a state statute in Louisiana to aid a railroad company by an annual tax constituted a contract and the company became entitled to its benefit, a provision in a subsequently enacted constitution exempting certain property

INDEX.
then taxable from all taxation does not impair the obligation of the original contract and the special tax cannot be imposed on the property so exempted. Arkansas Southern Ry. Co. v. Louisiana & Arkansas Ry. Co., 431.

Double jeopardy. See post, 14, 15.
10. Due processof law as appliedto criminal procedure;definition. As applied to criminal procedure, if the accused has been heard in a
court of competent jurisdiction and proceeded against under the orderly processes of law, and only punished after inquiry and investigation on notice with opportunity to be heard, and judgment awarded within the authority of a constitutional law, he has not been denied due process of law. Ong Chang Wing v. United States, 272.
11. Due processof law; effect of refusal of continuanceas denial. The granting and denial of continuances are matters within the dis-
cretion of the trial'court and are not ordinarily reviewable; in this case the refusal to grant a continuance did not amount to a denial of due process of law to the accused. Franklinv. South Carolina, 161.
12. Due process of law; effect to deny, of refusal of peremptory instruction of dismissal in criminal prosecution for homicide committed in resisting arrest under statute violative of Thirteenth Amendment.
Where one about to be arrested by an officer of the law under process issued under a law which is unconstitutional shoots the officer upon his entering the room, the question of right of resistance to arrest is for the jury and the accused is not entitled to a peremptory instruction of dismissal, nor is he denied due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment by the refusal of the court to give such instruction because the process was issued under a statute violative of the Thirteenth Amendment, to wit, § 357 of the Criminal Code of South Carolina in regard to agricultural contracts. Ib.
13. Due process of law; punishment without regard to intent. The mere fact that a state police'power punishes an offense actually
committed without regard to intent does not render the statute unconstitutional under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Shevlin-CarpenterCo. v. Minnesota, 57.

INDEX.
14. Due proces of law; validity of Minnesota law punishing eutting of timber on state lands.
The statute of Minnesota punishing the cutting and removal of timber on state lands and imposing double or triple damages and fine and imprisonment for violation, whether the offense be wilful or not, is not unconstitutional under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment either as putting one violating it in second jeopardy or because inflicting the penalties upon him regardless of his intent. lb.
15. Due process of law; quwre as to double jeopardy. Quwre, whether a state statute which inflicts two punishments in sepa-
rate proceedings for the same act is unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment. lb.
16. Due process of law; right of appeal as essential of; effect of Criminal Appeals Act of 1907 to deny.
A right of appeal is not essential to due process of law, Reetz v. Michigan, 188 U. S. 505, and neither due process of law nor equal protection of the law is denied to the accused by the act of March 2, 1907, c. 2564, 34 Stat. 1246, giving the Government an appeal to this court' under certain conditions from judgments sustaining demurrers to, or motions to quash, indictments because the same appeal is not allowed to the accused in case the demurrer or motion to quash is overruled. United States v. Heinze, 532.
17. Due process and equal protection of the law; effect of assessment by memoranda to deny.
The fact that the assessment is made by memoranda on the assessment envelope or jacket, does not render it ineffectual as lacking in due process of law because not recorded in a permanent book, and wheN the state court has held that an assessment so made is good under the law of the State, this court will not hold that it denied the party assessed due process of law or equal protection of the law. Illinois Central R. R. Co. v. Kentucky, 551.
18. Due process of law; effect of construction by state court that assessnent cannot enter into arrangementwith parties contemplating nonpayment of tax.
A construction by the state court that an assessment made by the board of assessors cannot enter into an arrangement with the parties assessed contemplating the non-payment of the tax based thereon does not deprive those parties of any constitutional rights .where no ground is shown for impugning the assessment so made. lb

INDEX.
19. Due process of law; deprivation of property; right of State to require other than owner of franchise to pay tax thereon.
The Federal Constitution does not preclude a State from requiring a corporation actually controlling and exercising a franchise to pay the tax legally assessed thereon, although not the actual owner of the franchise. lb.
20. Due process of law; deprivationof property;effect of state law against limitation of liability by public service corporation.
Public service corporations are subject to police regulation, and while the police power is not unlimited it does include provisions, in pursuance of the public policy of the State, against such a corporation limiting its liability for its own negligence, and a statute to that effect does not deprive the public service corporation affected thereby of its property without due process of law. Western Union Tel. Co. v. Commercial Milling Co., 406.
21. Due process of law; effect to deny to railroad,by non-compensationfor structure made necessary by street opening through its right of way.
A railway company is not deprived of its property without due process of law either under the Fifth or the Fourteenth Amendment because in a street opening proceeding it is not awarded, in addition to the value of the land taken, the cost of the new structure which must necessarily be erected to carry its right of way over the street, as required for the safety and convenience of the public. Cincinnati,I. & W. Ry. Co. v. Connersville, 336.
22. Due process of law; deprivation of woperty without; regulation of coinage as.
The quality of legal tender of coin is an attribute of law aside from its bullion value and renders such coin as the Government has made legal tender subject to such reasonable regulations by the police power as public policy may require including prohibition against exportation, and the exercise of such power does not deprive the owner of his property without due process of law even if the bullion value in a foreign country exceeds the legal tender value in the country of coinage. Ling Su Fan v. United States, 302. See ante, 7; post, 45, 46; DUE PROCESS OF LAW; PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE, 17.
23. Equalprotectionof the laws; power of State to fix basis of classification. A State does not offend the equality clause of the Fourteenth Amend-
ment by taking as a basis of classification the ways by which a law may be defeated. (St. John v. New York, 201 U. S. 633,) Shevlin-. CarpenterCo. v. Minnesota, 57.

INDEX.
24. Equal protection of the law; power of States to classify. The equal protection provision of the Fourteenth Amendment did not
deprive the States of the power to classify, but only of the abuse of such power; nor is the clause offended against because some inequality may be occasioned by a classification in legislation properly enacted under the police power. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Mellon, 36.
25. Equal protectionof the law; validity-of classificationby State. A classification in a state police statute proper as to a general class is
not unconstitutional under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it ignores inequalities as to some persons embraced within the general class. Ib
26. Equal protection of the law; validity of Employers' Liability Statute of Indiana of 1893.
The Employers' Liability Statute of Indiana of 1893 is not unconstitutional under the equal -protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it subjects railroad employ&s to a special rule as to the doctrine of fellow servant, Tullis v. Lake Erie & Western R. R. Co., 175 U. S.348; PittsburgRy. Co. v. Martin, 212 U. S. 560; nor is it unconstitutional under that clause as to such employds of railroads, such as bridge carpenters, as are not subject to the hazards peculiarly resulting from the operation of a railroad. Ib.
27. Equal protection of the law; validity of classification by State under police power.
Classification will not render a state police statute unconstitutional as denying equal protection of the law so long as there is a reasonable basis for such classification; nor will exceptions of specified classes render the law unconstitutional unless there is no fair reason for the law that would not equally require its extension to the excepted class. (Williams v. Arkansas, 217 U. S. 79.) Watson v. Maryland, 173.
28. Equal protectionof the law; classificationunder police power; validity of Marylandmedical registrationlaw.
The medical registration law of Maryland (art. 43, § 83, Code of 1904) is not unconstitutional as denying equal protection of the law because its provisions do not apply to those who practiced prior to a specified date and treated at least twelve persons within a year prior thereto, or because it does not apply to gratuitous services, or to physicians in hospitals, none of the exceptions being unreasonable.' 1b.

INDEX.
29. Equal protection of the law; classificationwithin police power of Stage. Classification, on a reasonable basis of subjects, within the police power,
is within legislative discretion and a reasonable selection which is not merely arbitrary and without real difference does not deny equal protection of the laws within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. Griffith v. Connecticut, 563.
30. Equal protectionof the law; classifcationof carriersfor regulation. A classification of teleraph companies in a statute prohibiting limi-
tation of liability isreasonable and does not deny equal protection of the law to telegraph companies because it does not apply to common carriers. Western Union Tel. Co. v. Commercial Milling Co., 406.
31. Equal protection of the law-Validity of Connecticut statute of 1907, limiting interest on loans.
The statute of Connecticut of 1907, limiting interest on loans, is not unconstitutional as denying equal protection of the laws because it excepts loans made by national and state banks and trust companies and bona fide mortgages, on real and personal property; the classification is a reasonable one. Griffith v. Connecticut, 563.
32. Equal protection of the laws; exclusion of negroes from grandjury. Where the state court has held that under the state jury law the com-
missioners are only required to select men of good moral character and that competent negroes are equally eligible with others, this court cannot hold that a negro is denied equal protection of the law by reason of the statute because the commissioners have not selected any negroes for the grand jury which indicted him; and so held as to the jury law of 1902 of South Carolina. Franklinv. South Carolina, 161.
33. Equal protection of the law; taxation. When the record does not show that others similarly situated escaped
the taxation imposed on the plaintiff in error, and the state court has declared that if any escaped they are still liable, this court regards the contention of denial of equal protection of the law as without merit. Illinois Central R. R. Co. v. Kentucky, 551.
34. Equal protection of the law; quwre as to application of provision to United States--Power of Congress to classify.
Even if, and not now decided, the equal protection provision of the Fourteenth Amendment apply to the United States, it can have no broader meaning when so applied than when applied to the

INDEX.
States; and even if Congress may not discriminate in legislation, it has the power to classify and the classification in the act of March 2,1907, is well within such power. United State8 v. Heinze, -532.
See ante, 7, 16, 17; post, 45, 46.
35. Full faith and credit clause; past due znstaUments of judgment for future alimony within.
Past due installments of a judgment for future alimony rendered in one State are within the protection of the full faith and credit clause of the Federal Constitution unless the right, to receive the alimony is so discretionary with the court rendering the decree that, even in the absence of application to modify-the decree, no vested right exists. Sistare v. Sistare, 1.
36. Full faith and credit clause; when judgment for alimony not within. Unless a decision of this court in terms overrules a former decision, it
will, if possible, be so construed as to harmonize with, and not overrule such prior decision;.and so held that Barberv. Barber, 21 How. 582, establishing the general rule that a judgment for alimony as to past installments was within the full faith and credit clause was not overruled by Lynde v. Lynde, 181 U. S. 187, but the latter case established the exceptikn as to such judgments where the alimony is so discretionary with the court that a vested right to receive the same does not exist. Ib.
37. Full faith and credit clause; when judgment for alimony absolute and therefore within.
The settled doctrine in New York in 1899 was that no power existed to modify a judgment for alimony absolute in terms unless conferred by statute, and a judgment for future alimony entered in 1899 under §§ 1762-1773, Code of 'Civil Procedure, is absolute until modified by the court rendering it; such a judgment, therefore, as to past due installments, falls under the general rule that it is entitled to full faith and credit in the courts of another State. Barber v. Barber, 21 How. 582, followed; Lynde v. Lynde, 181 U. S. 187, distinguished. Ib.
38. Fullfaith and credit clause; effect of difference in modes of procedure to enforce judgment.
Although the full faith and credit clause may not extend to mere modes of procedure) a judgrent absolute in terms and enforcible in the State where rendered must, under the full faith and credit clause of the Federal Constitution, be enforced by the courts of another

INDEX.
State, even though the modes of procedure to enforce its collection may not be the same in both States. Ib
39. Fullfaith and credit clause;judgment againstcorporation after withdrawal from State in which rendered, not entitled to.
A power of attorney to a state officer to accept process required by statute to be given by a foreign corporation as a condition for doing business in the State although irrevocable in form, may be revocable, on the withdrawal of such corporation from the State, as to matters not connected with business transacted in such State or with residents thereof; and the courts of one State are not required to give full faith and credit, under the Federal Constitution, to a judgment of another State against a corporation based on service on a state officer of that State, in which said corporation had done business but from which it had in good faith withdrawn after revoking the power of attorney which it had given to such officer as a condition fbr doing business in the State, and where the cause of action did not arise in, or was not con-. nected with a transaction arising in such State, or in favor of a citizen thereof. Hunter v. Mutual Reserve Life Ins. Co., 573. ' See FEDERAL QUESTION, 2.
40. Judicialpower of the United States; action againstState; suit to enjoin state officers not within prohibition.
Ex parte Young, 209 U. .. 1, and West. Un. Tel. Co. v. Andrews, 216 U. S. 165, followed, to effect that an action brought to enjoin state officers charged with the execution of a state statute from enforcing the same on the ground that such statute violates the Federal Constitution is not an action against the State within the prohibltion of the Eleventh Amendment. Herndon v. Chicago, R. I. & Pac. Ry. Co., 135; Roach v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co., 159.
41. Judicialpower of the UnitedStates;right of resort to courts; invalidity of stoe statute abridgingright.
While the right to do local business within a State may not be derived fgom the Federal Constitution, the right to resort to Federal courts is one created by that Constitution; and, as against a foreign corporation already established within its borders, a State cannot forfeit the right to do business because of the bringing of an action in the Federal court, and so held that the act of March 13, 1907, of Missouri, imposing such a penalty, is unconstitutional and void as to a foreign corporation already in the State at that time. lb.

42. Public welfare; exclusiveness of declared principle. The Constitution declares the principle upon which the public welfare
is to be promoted and opposing ones cannot be substituted. (Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co., 184 U. S. 540, 558.) ShevlinCarpenterCo. v. Minnesota, 57.
43. Self-incrimination-Prohibitionof FifthAmendment defined; body of accused as evidence.
The prohibition of the Fifth Amendment against compelling a man to give evidence against himself is a prohibition of the use of physical or moral compulsion to extort. communications from him and not an exclusion of his body as evidence when it is material; and so held that testimony of a witness that the accused put on a garment and it fitted him is admissible, whether the accused had put on the garment voluntarily or under duress. Holt v. United States, 245.
44. States; power to select and classify subjects for taxation. The Constitution of the United States does not, as a general rule, con-
trol the power of the States to select and classify subjects for taxation; and vested rights which cannot be impaired by subsequent legislation may still be classified for, and subjected to, taxation. Moffitt v. Kelly, 400.
I
45. States;taxation of community property on death of husband,not denial to surviving wife of constitutionalright.
A State may classify for taxation estates passing by will or intestacy and include therein property held as community property by husband and wife at the time of the death of the husband and becoming completely vested in the wife, without violating either the contract, due process, or equal protection provision of the Constitution; the mere fact that the wife had a prefxisting right of property creates no exemption from taxation if the selection of that class of estates is legal. lb.
46. States; validity of Californiainheritancetax law of 1905. The law of California of 1905, taxing all property passing by will or
intestacy, having been construed by the highest court of that State as applying to the surviving wife's share of the community property, this court holds that such tax is not in conflict with either the contract, due process or equal protection clause of the Constitution of the United States. lb.

tain possession of vessels in course of construction and seized by judicial proceedings under state law should not, under §§ 3753, 3754, Rev. Stat., be construed as depriving the United States of any rights asserted under the contracts for constructing such vessels. United States v. Ansonia Brass & Copper C6, 452.
2. Government; construction as.to vesting of title to uncompleted vessels. Construing the three contracts for construction of vessels involved in
this case, the court construes one contract as vesting title in the United States as the work progressed and the others as not giving the United States a superior lien on the uncompleted vessel as work progressed; in regard to the one contract, the state lien law does not, and in regard to the other contract such law does, apply. lb.

A transaction of great magnitude such as the purchase by a city of a water supply system will not be defeated because of minor obstacles; and if the deed tendered includes a few properties to which title is not perfect or if there are incumbrances on the properties, the court can bring the proper parties in and the deed can be modified and interests protected so as to carry out, and not defeat, the transaction. Omaha v. Omaha Water Co., 180.

5. Power to appointcommissioner to carryjudgment into execution.

As the laws of Arizona authorize the Supreme Court to cause its judg-

common use is awarded and in apportioning the expense pro rata

between them. Montezuma Canal Co. v. Smithville CanalCo., 371.

three years before the finding of the indictment, will be open under

the general issue and unaffected by this decision. lb.

act defining offense on punishmentfor.act committed before repeal." The lawmaking power in the Philippine Islands has power to preserve
by statutory enactment the right to prosecute and punish offenses committed prior to the repeal of an act defining and punishing the offense; and a decision of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands holding that one who committed the offense before the repeal of the act can be punished after the repeal, does not amount to a denial of due process of law within the meaning of the due process clause of the act of July 1, 1902.

2. Philippine Islands; what constitutes due process under organic act of 1902-Validity of act prohibitingexportationof silver coin.
Sections 1 and 2 of law No. 1411 of the Philippine Commission, prohibiting exportation of Philippine silver coin from the Philippine Islands, is not void as depriving the owner of such coin of his property therein without due process of laWlwithin the meaning of the due process provision of the organic act of 1902. Congress, by the act of March 2, 1903, c. 980, 32 Stat. 952, authorized the government of the Philippine Islands to adopt such measures as it deemed proper and not inconsistent with the organic act to maintain parity of gold and silver coinage.

EQUITY. 1. Powers of court of equity over infants. The inherent power of a court of equity of general jurisdiction over the
persons and estates of infants is very wide. Its errors in regard to a sale of real estate of infants are reversible by appellate procedure, but until so corrected its judgment is not a nullity. Hine v. Morse, 493.
2. Power of court of equity to requireconditions, including giving of bond, on suspending decree after filing of cross bill.
Where the filing of a cross bill would tie up property pending the determination of title, the court does not-err in requiring the party filing it, to apply for an injunction and give a bond as required by the rules of the court; nor Will this court assume that the amount of the-bond was too large when such party did not invoke further action, but took an appeal before the expiration of the time allowed for complying with the provisions of the decree. Moore PrintingCo. v. National Say. & Trust Co., 422.
3. Rescission of contract for breach-Enforced. Where the contractor under a municipal water supply contract wholly
fails to furnish an adequate supply of pure water according to the contract, the municipality has no adequate remedy at law; it may treat the contract as ended and a court of equity may enforce such rescission. Columbus v. Mercantile Trust Co., 645.
4. Application of maxim that he who seeks equity must do equity. The maxim that he who seeks equity nmust do equity applies to one
affirmatively seeking relief. It does not vest a court of equity with power to impose on a defendant terms as a condition for dismissing the bill where plaintiff wholly fails to prove his case, even if defendant has filed a cross bill for defensive relief. lb.
5. Power to'compel municipality seeking to erect own water supply plant, to purchase part of plant of defaulting contractorfor water supply.
Where a water company has wholly failed' to live up to its contract and the municipality has determined by ordinance to erect its own plant, a court of equity cannot, in a suit brought by the water company to restrain the municipality on the ground of impairment of contract, require the municipality to purchase any part of the plaintiff's plant as a condition for dismissing the bill. lb.

EVIDENCE. 1.Admissibility in civil action of judgment in criminalproceeding. The general rule of the common law is that a judgment in a criminal
proceeding cannot be read in evidence in a civil action to establish any fact there determined. The parties are not the same and different rules of evidence are applicable. Chantangco v. Abaroa, 476.
2. Same. Identity of parties will not always operate to make a judgment in a
criminal action admissible in a civil action; there must be identity of issue, Stone v. United States, 167 U. S. 178, although as held in Coffey v. United States, 116 U. S. 436, when the facts are ascertained in a criminal case as between the United States and the defendant they cannot be again litigated as between him and the United States as the basis of any statutory punishment denounced as a consequence of the existence of the facts. lb.
3. Same-Considerationsin case coming from PhilippineIslands. In a case coming from the Philippine Islands, however, this court will
not apply the common-law rule as to effect to be given in a subsequent civil case to a judgment in a criminal case, but will consider only whether the local law of the Philippine Islands has been rightly applied. lb.
4. Identificationof military reservation;competency of evidence. In this case the objections to evidence identifying the military reserva-
tion on whiqh a capital crime was alleged to have been committed, including introduction of deeds and condemnation proceedings, were properly overruled, and quwre whether the United States is called on to try title to a reservation where it'is in de facto exercise of exclusive jurisdiction.

2. When construction by state court of statute of another State raises. A question under the Federal Constitution does not necessarily, arise
in every case in which the courts of one State are called upon to

3. When question as to whether State has violated act of 1868 relative to qualificationsof jurorsand electors, consideredat instance of one convicted of crime.
Whether provisions as to qualifications of jurors and electors-in subsequently adopted constitution and subsequently enacted laws of one of the States enumerated in the act of Congress of June 25, 1868, c. 70, 15 Stat. 73, providing that the constitution of such States should never be amended so as to deprive citizens of the United States of their rights as electors, violate such act will not be determined at the instance of a person convicted of crime unless it appears that persons qualified under the Federal act were disqualified and thereby prevented from serving on the jury by the constitution and laws the validity whereof is attacked.

1. Assault; sufficiency of indictmentfor. Where the acts constituting the assault are alleged to have been made
feloniously and with malice aforethought, it is not necessary to make such allegations in the preliminary averment of assault. Holt v. Unied States, 245.

2. Evidenc before grandjury; effect of considerationof incompetent. Indictments should not be upset because some evidence, in its nature
competent, but rendered incompetent by circumstances, was considered along with other evidence. lb.

3. Sufficiency of indictment under § 52o9, Rev. Stat. Where the indictment charges an officer-of a national -bankwith willful
misapplication of funds of the bank, induced by, and resulting in, his advantage, with the illegal intent to injure and defraud the bank by receiving and discounting with its moneys an absolutely unsecured promissory note of a named party whereby the proceeds of the discount of the note were Wholly lost to the bank, it sufficiently charges a violation of §'5209, Rev. Stat. It is not necessary to allege conversion by the officer of the bank and also by the recipient of the proceeds of the discount. United States v.
Heinze, 532, 547.

4. Same-Equivalentof allegation that loss was caused by discountingof note.

A charge that a note for an amount was received for discount which

was wholly unsecured and which sum was lost to the bank amounts

to a direct allegation that'the loss was caused by the discount-

INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION.
1. Rate regulation; intent of order, reducing rates between Mississippi River points and MissouriRiver cities.
The Interstate Commerce Commission having made an order reducing rates between Mississippi River points and Missouri River cities, the railroad companies brought suit to enjoin the enforcement of the order, claiming that it was made not for the mere purpose of fixing just rates but for the purpose of artificially apportioning the country into zones tributary to trade centers, which was beyond the power of the Commission. The claim was made that the rates as reduced were confiscatory within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment. The Circuit Court so held and enjoined the rate. On appeal to this court held that the Interstate Commerce Commission did not base its order on an effort to apportion the country into zones tributary to trade centers and to build up new trade centers. Interstate Commerce Comm. v. Chicago, R. I. & Pac. Ry. Co., 88; Same v. Chicago, B. & Q. R.. R. Co., 113.
2. Comprehensiveness of powers. The outlook of the Interstate Commerce Commission and its powers
are greater than the interests of the railroads, and are as comprehensive as the interests of the entire country. lb.
3. Purpose of; powers as to rates. The Interstate Commerce Commission was instituted to prevent dis-
crimination between persons and places. Rates may not only be investigated and pronounced unreasonable or discriminatory but other rates may be prescribed. I.
4. Power to regulate rates. The power of the Interstate Commerce Commission extends to the
regulation of rates whether the same be old or new, notwithstand-

INDEX.
ing that interests attached to the rates may have to be changed in case the Commission exercises its power. lb.
5. Ordersof; ground an which railroadsmay complain of rate reduction. Railroad companies may complain of an order of the Commission re-
ducing rates so far as it affects their revenue. They cannot complain of it simply because it affects shippers or places. Ib.
6. Rate regulation;jurisdiction of Commission and of reviewing court. The primary jurisdiction as to fixing rates under the Interstate Com-
merce Act is with the Commission and the power of the court is confined to a review of questions of constitutional power exercised by the Commission. Ib.
7. Court review of orders of. In this case .theonly question being as.to power and the rates not being
confiscatory and the Commission having acted within its power, .the case is remanded with instructions to dismiss the bill. Ib.

JOINT RESOLUTIONS OF CONGRESS. See LIENS.
JUDGMENTS AND DECREES. 1. Power of court after end of term at which decree was entered. A court cannot deal with a decree other than for correction of clerical
error or inadvertance after the termination of the term at which it was entered. In re Metropolitan Trust Co., 312.
2. Vacation of judgment after term at which entered. After the Circuit Court has refused to remand, has tried the.issues and
entered judgment dismissing the-complaint as to certain defendants, it cannot, after the Circuit Court of Appeals*has, on an appeal to which such defendants were not made parties, reversed the order refusing to remand, vacate 'the judgment dismissing the complaint- as to the defendants nqt parties after the expiration of the term at which such judgment was entered. Ib.
3. Nullification of reversed judgment isto parties not appaling;want of power in CircuitCourt.
A decree of the Circuit Court, t0fusing to remand a cause cannot, even if error and subsequen*y reversed on appeal.by the Circuit Court

INDEX.

of Appeals, be treated as a nullity; and proceedings of the Circuit
Court while it retained jurisdiction as to defendants- not parties to such appeal remain in full force. lb.

4. Parties bound by. All parties to the record who appear to have any interest in the chal-
lenged ruling must be given an opportunity to be heard on an appeal, and the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals reversing a decree of the Circuit Court applies only to the parties brought before that court. Ib.

5. Collateral attack on decree where bill does not clearly state case within jurisdictionof court.
Even if the bill seeking a sale of infant's property for reinvestinent does not clearly state a case within the authority of the court, the decree of sale, appointment of trustee and execution of his bond are not mere nullities subject to collateral attack. Hine v. Morse, 493.

6. Res judicataof judgment determining rightsof appropriatorsof water. Notwithstanding there may have been a prior appropriation of water,
if the rights of appropriators were adjudicated in a suit of which the parties had notice, the judgment in that suit may be pleaded as res judicata in a subsequent suit to determine the rights of appropriators, and the amount awarded to an appropriator by judgment in the first suit cannot be reduced. Montezuma Canal Co. v. Smithville Canal Co., 371.

7. Validity of decree not affected by provisionfor machinery to enforce it.

The fact that it is within the legislative power to provide adminis-

trative machinery to supervise the common use of water, does

not render invalid the decree of a court providing such machinery

to carry out a particular decree if the court deems it necemsary

and proper so:to do. Ib. See ADMIRALTY, 3, 4;

1. Of congressionalelections. This court judicially knows that the members of Congress elected at
the regular congressional election of November, 1908, have taken their beats, served their terms, and that their successors have been elected. Richardson v. McChesney, 487.

JURISDICTION.
A. OF THIS COURT.
1. Appeals from Circuit Court ofAppeals underBankruptcyLaw; finality of decision.
Section 25b of the Bankruptcy Law only gives a right of appeal to this court from a decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals affirming or reversing the order of the District Court, allowing or rejecting a claim when the decision is final, whether there is a certificate under § 25b, 2 or not. A decision simply allowing or disallowing a claim for voting purposes without prejudice to its subsequent presentation is not final but provisional. Duryea Power Co. v. Sternbergh, 299.

2. Appeals from Circuit Courts of Appeals in bankruptcy matters No appeal lies to this court from a decision of the Circuit Court of
Appeals in the exercise of supervisory jurisdiction in bankruptcy matters. Nor can a petition for revision to that court be turned into an appeal. Ib.

3. On certificate from Circuit Court of Appeals; sufficiency of certificate.

Where, as in this case, the certificate sufficiently states both the qlies-

tion,and the desire of the Circuit Court of Appeals for instructions

so that it may make a proper decision, it conforms in substance to

the provisions of § 6 of the act of March 3, 1891, c.- 517, 26 Stat.

The rightof.the Circuit Court to take jprisdieti#n,of a case as one aris-

INDEX.
distinctly appear in the allegations of the bill; but this court may take jurisdiction of direct appeal from the Circuit Court under § 5 of the Court of Appeals Act if it properly appears that a right under the Constitution and laws of the United States was duly claimed during the case. (Loeb v. Columbia Township, 179 U. S: 472.) Memphis v. Cumberland Telephone Co., 624.
5. Of direct appealfrom CircuitCourt; what constitutes case arisingunder Constitutionand laws of United States.
Where diverse citizenship exists and the bill alleges, and the Circuit Court holds, that the defendant municipality had no authority to pass the ordinance complained of, the case is not one arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States; and, although the judge may have declared in his opinion that the ordinance violated complainant's Federal rights, this court has not jurisdiction on a direct appeal under § 5 of the Court of Appeals Act. lb.
,. 6. Under § 709, Rev. Stat.; what amounts to assertionof Federalright. Where the United States claimed in an action in the state court to determine liens on vessels in course of construction, that, under the contract, title had vested in the United States, or that liens had been specially reserved thereon, and also claimed that the rights of the United States were superior to all others and could not be retarded or impeded by the state lien law, assertions are made of rights and immunities which are the creation of Federal authority, and, if denied by the state court, this court has jurisdiction under § 709, Rev. Stat., to review the judgment. United. States v. Ansonia Brass & Copper Co., 452.·
7. Under act of March 2, 1907, CriminalAppeals Act. Where the Circuit Court held the indictment insufficient because the
facts alleged did not constitute a crime under the statute as it held that the latter should be construed, this court has jurisdiction of an appeal by the Government under the act of March 2 1907, c. 2564, 34 Stat. 1246. United States v. Heinze, 532.
8. Under CriminalAppeals Act of 1907 where quashing of indictment an exercise of judicialdiscretion.
If the decision of the Circuit Court quashing an indictment is based upon invalidity or construction of the statute upon which the indictment is founded, an appeal lies to this court under the act of March 2, 1907, even if the motion to quash be granted as an exercise of the discretion of the court. United States v. Heinze, No. 2, 547.

INDEX.
9. Under contract clause of Constitution. The jurisdiction of this court, under the contract clause of the Federal
Constitution, extends to doing away with the interference of a later law impairing the contract,-but not to remedying erroneous construction of the original contract or to seeing that it is carried out according to-the interpretation of this court, apart from it. There is nothing in this case that takes it out of the general rule above stated. Fisher v. New Orleans, 438.
10. Where fads as to existence of constitutional question must be ascertained.
This court must satisfy itself whether or not the party claiming the benefit of a contract which it claims was impaired by subsequent legislation had acquired rights under the original contract and therefore has jurisdiction. Arkansas Southern Ry. Co. v. Louisiana & Arkansas Ry. Co., 431.
11. Under TerritorialPracticeAct of 1874. Under the Territorial Practice Act- of April 7, 1874, c. 80, 18 Stat. .27,
the jurisdiction of this court on appeals is limited to the inquiry whether the findings of fact support the judgment and to a review of duly taken exceptions and rulings on admission or rejection of evidence. Eagle Mining Co. v. Hamilton, 513.
12. Where jurisdictionof Admiralty Court denied. Where the decree of the lower court is founded on denial of jurisdic-
tion of the Admiralty Court, this court has jurisdiction of the appeal. The Ira M. Hedges, 264.
13. To review decision of state court on local question. The nature and character of the right of a wife in community property
for the purpose of taxation is a peculiarly local question, and the determination of the state court in regard thereto is not reviewable by this court. Moffit v. Kelly, 400.
14. Amount in iontroversy; ascertainment of. Jurisdiction as to amount in controversy' sustained on the facts dis-
closed in affidavits filed in this court, there being none filed in rebuttal. Roura v. Philippine Islands, 386.
15. Errorswithin the power of this court to notice. On writ of error to review a judgment of conviction of the state covrt
this court has no jurisdiction to notice errors other than those which involve alleged violations of Federal.rights.. The States

have the right to administer their own laws for the prosecutioi if crime so long as fundamental rights secured by Federal law arc not denied. Frantklin v. South Carolina, 161.
B. OF CIRCUIT COURT. 1. Diversity of citizenship to confer. Effect of want of residence by any of
the parties in district where suit brought. Plaintiffs, citizens of States other than that of the defendant, brought
suit against the defendants in the Circuit Court of the United States for a district of which neither plaintiff nor this defendant were inhabitants to compel defendants to abate a nuisance carried on in the district in which the court was located and which was causing damage to property of the plaintiffs in another State and in which they nor the defendant resided; the Circuit Court dismissed as to this defendant for want of jurisdiction, neither it nor the plaintiff being inhabitant of that district. In affirming judgment held that diversity of citizenship-nothing more appearing-will not give the Circuit Court jurisdiction to render judgment in personam where neither plaintiff nor defendant is an inhabitant of the district in which the suit is brought and the defendant appears specially and objects to the jurisdiction. Ladew v. Tennessee Copper Co., 357; Wetmore v. Tennessee Copper Co., 369.
2. Under act of March 3, 1875. Suit to abate nuisance maintained on real property not within jurisdiction.
The jurisdiction given to the Circuit Court by § 8 of the act of March 3, 1875, .c. 137, 18 Stat. 470, of suits to enforce legal or equitable claims to real or personal property within the district, even if the parties are not inhabitants of the district, does not extend to suits to compel the owner of real estate in the district to abate a nuisance maintained thereon. Such a cause of action is not a claim or lien upon the property. b.
3. Congressionalaction necessary to confer jurisdiction. The jurisdiction of the Circuit Courts is determined by acts of Con-
gress enacted in pursuance of the Constitution, and even if the jurisdiction already granted caA be extended by Congress, those courts cannot, until such legislation is enacted, exercise jurisdiction not yet conferred upon them. lb.
See ante, A 4.
C. OF FEDERAL COURTS GENERALLY. 1. A moutit in controrer.sy;tr nis-fer of stock for purpose of. Jurisdiction does not depend on motive. Although shares of stock

INDEX.
may have been transferred to a non-resident to enable himi to bring suit in the Federal court., if it appears from the record that he is the absolute owner of properly issued shares, exceeding ,2,000 in value, jurisdiction exists. In re Cleland, 120.
2. Defcat of jurisdiction; denials as to jurisdictionalfacts in ex parte affidavits impotent to effect.
Jurisdiction of a suit to wind up a corporation having once properly -attached, a receiver appointed, and creditors, as between whom and the corporation diverse citizenship exists and the requisite amount is involved, joined as parties, the jurisdiction cannot be subsequently defeated by denials in ex parte affidavits of the jurisdictional facts. Ib.
3. Unauthorizedmunicipal legislationas foundation of-When reference in pleading deemed to be to state, and not Federal, constitution.
Municipal legislation passed without authority of the State does not lay the foundation of Federal jurisdiction; and statements in the bill to the effect that the ordinances complained of were unauthorized and illegal will be held to refer to the state, rather than to the Federal, constitution, in the absence of distinct references to the latter. Memphis v. Cumberland Telephone Co., 624
D. OF TERRITORIAL COURTS. Of District Court of Arizona bf action by grantee of Mexican Govern-
Inent to quiet title. Notwithstanding the contention of appellant in this case, the decision
of this court in Ainsa v. New Mexico & Arizona R. R. Co., No. 2, 175 U. S. 91, that the District Court of Arizona had jurisdiction of an action to quiet title brought by a grantee of the Mexican Governnment of land in the territory included in the Gadsden Purchase, did not proceed upon a mistake in fact and is not inconsistent with the reasoning of the decision of Ainsa v. New Mexico & Arizona R. R. Co., No. 1, 175 U. S: 76. Richardson v. Ainsa, 289.
E. SUPREME COURT OF THE DISTRICT ,Or COLUMBIA.
Jurisdiction defined. The Supreme Court of the District of Columbiais one of. general juris-
diction possessing all powers conferred on- Ciuit ahd District Courts of the United States--in fact, the usual powers incident to a court of equity at the date of the Revolution, not incompatible with the changed forms and principles of government or affected by subsequent legislation.

JURY AND JURORS.
1. Exclusion during discussion of admissibility of confession; discretion
of court.
Although the more conservative course is to exclude the jury during discussions of admissibility of confessions,. in the absence of statutory provision it is within the discretion of the trial judge to allow the jury to remain; and where, as in this case, he cautions the jury that the preliminary evidence has no bearing on the question to be decided, it is not error to do so. Holt v. United States, 245.

2. Challengefor cause; refusal to sustain; when reversibleerror.

Unless the error is manifest the reviewing court should not set aside the finding of the trial court refusing to sustain a challenge of a
juryman for cause on the ground of partiality or expressed opin-

ions. Ir.

Although restitution of property obtained under a contract which is illegal because ultra vires, cannot be adjudged by force of the illegal contract, the courts will compel restitution of property of another obtained without authority of law; and, although the contract under which a national bank obtains money from an innocent third party may be ultra ires under Rev. Stat., §§ 5133-5136, the bank may be required to return the money so received to the party entitled thereto. (Citizens' National Bank v. Arnpleton, Receiver, 216 U. S. 196.) Rankin v. Emigh, 27.

predicate error asto matters which should be, and are not, pleaded or proved. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Melton, 36.
7. Sope of review; concern with state court's construction of statute of another State.
This court is not concerned with the construction given by a state court to the statute of another State unless such construction offends a properly asserted Federal right. b.
8. Scope of review; effect of construction of statute by highest court of State enacting it on'duty of this court in reviewing decision of court of anotherState construingit.
The fact that since the decision of a state court under review construing a police statute of another State as including certain elements of a class, the highest court of the enacting State has construed the statute as excluding such elements does not necessarily enlarge the duty of this court in determining the validity of the decision under review. b.
9. Scope of inquiryas to power to repealcharterof corporation. This court does not inquire into the knowledge, negligence, methods
or motives of the legislation if, as in this case, the statute is passed in due form; and where the statute repeals the charter of a corporation under the reserved power of repeal, the only question here is whether the statute goes beyond the power expressly reserved.. Calder v. Michigan, 591.
10. Sope of review; denialof motionfor new trial not reviewed. In considering a motion for new trial in a capital case on the ground
that the jury was allowed to separate during the trial and that duriAg the separation they saw newspaper articles bearing on the case, the court may, if it is going to deny the motion, assume that the jurors did read the articles, and the discretion of the trial court in denying the motion will not be reviewed in the absence of any conclusive ground that he was wrong, notwithstanding the more conservative -course is not to allow the jury to separate in such cases. Holt v. United States, 245.
11. Scope of review; findings of fact by state court not reviewable. On writ of error to review the judgment of a state court holding that,
a deed to Anational bank was not void under the Federal statute,. this court will not review findings of the state court of fact as to the acceptance of the deed. Kefoot v. Farmers' & Merchants' Bank, 281.

12. Scope -f inquiry in determining validity of law of Philippiiw.(0tnmissjirn.
In determihing wheiher a law of the Philippihe Commission is iivalid as inconsistent with theorgonic act this; court puts, aside sIll qpes-. tions of the wisdomi off the&law, even if enacted! in, the! face. off axioms of commemre, anl! considers only whether power exists, to) enacb under;. andt whether the enactment, is inconsistent, with,,; thtt organic ant..

13. Scope-of review-i dLtemni4iig constitutionaliy,of state,twar.. In determining whether a tax imposed by a State is+constitutiona', this,
court is not concernedi with the designation of the tax or whether the thing,taxed may, or may not, have been mistakenly brought wi'thii the, lakw it is confined solely to determining whether the State has power to tevy a tax on the subjiect taxed. Moffitt v. Kellyr 4QO
14. Scope of'review; plea to answer other than one demurredto and made suject of appealiwt considered.
Where all that this court has before it is the demurrer on one plea to the answer which was overruled below, it reverses the judgment and sustains the demurrer, and other pleas in defense remain at issue and this court will not consider them on this appeal. Hine v. Morse, 493..
15. Scope of inquiry as to validity of an indictment. Quwre, and not necessary to be decided in this case, how far, if at all,
the court is warranted in inquiring into the nature of the evidence on which the grand jury acts, and how far in case of such inquiry the discretion of the trial court is subject to review. Holt v. United Stales, 245..
16. Facts; binding effect of finding of state court. On error to a state court of last resort in a case involving the liability
of a national bank under a contract, the findings of fact of the state court are binding on this court, and only the Federal question as to the effect of the facts found can be passed on. Rankin v. Emigh, 27.
17. Conclusiveness of state court's construction of state statute. The decision of the state court that an offense under a statute did not
depend on conditions as to notice contained in another statute is conclusive on this court; and one convicted in a state court is not denied due process of law by reason of such construction. Watson v. Maryland, 173.

INDEX.
18. Following state court's construction of state constitution. This court follows the state court, in determining the extent of a spe-
cial inunnity from taxation granted by the constitution of the State. Arkansas Southern Ry. Co. v. Louisiana & Arkansas Ry. Co., 431.
19. Affirmance without opinion, when. It is the practice of this court to affirm without opinion where the
judgment under review is not decided to be erroneous by a majority of the court sitting in the cause. Hertz v. Woodman, 205.
20. Motions to dismiss or affirm. Frivolous questions. When motion to aoffirm prevails.
If the validity of the particular subject of classification assailed has not been so foreclosed by prior decisions as to render discussion frivolous the motion to dismiss will be denied, but if, as in this case, it is manifest that the contention is, in view of prior decisions, without merit, the motion to affirm will prevail. Griffith v. Connecticut, 563.
21. Reference to opinion of CircuitCourt;for what purpose permitted. While the opinion of the Circuit Court may not be examined to ascer-
tain what should, under proper practice, appear in the pleadings or bill of exceptions, it may be looked to, when annexed and forming part of the record, to ascertain whether either party claimed, and was denied, a Federal right. Memphis v. Cumberland Telephone Co., 624.
22. Rulings on questions of evidence; when not considered. Rulings on questions of evidence are not properly before this court
when the exceptions thereto do not appear in the record, and, even though objections to testimony may have been noted, if it does not appear what the rulings were and whether the testimony was or was not excluded, this court is confined to determining whether the findings support the judgment; and in this case the facts found by the court below unquestionably support the judgment. Eagle Mining Co. v. Hamilton, 513.
23. Parties;question of, not open. In this case, held that the question of parties is not open in this court.

Cost of duplication, less depreciation, of a water system, is less than the commercial value of the system as a going concern; and, even though the value of the unexpired franchise be expressly excluded from the appraisal, where the parties contemplate the purchase of a complete water system in operation, a reasonable amount should be included in the appraisal for the."going value" over the value of the physical properties.

PUBLIC LANDS.
1. Character of lands; conclusiveness of decision of Commissioner of Land Office as to.
A decision of the Commissioner of the Land Office, on notice to all

INDEX.
parties and after hearing, that lands claimed as swamp or overflowed under the Swamp Land Act of 1850, are not swamp or overflowed, or of a character embraced by the act, and which has never been appealed from, modified or reversed, but has been relied on by purchasers for value and in good faith, should not, after a lapse of twenty-five years, be disturbed by the courts where it does not appear that the lands were actually swamp or overflowed, when the decision was made. United States v. Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co., 233.
2. Railway grants; when effective. The grant made by the act of May 12, 1864, c. 84, 13 Stat. 72, was
one in prsenti. lb.
3. Railway grants; rights of beneficiary of grant in prwsenti. Where a railway land grant is one in prarsenti the beneficiary is en-
titled to all the lands granted within place limits which had not been appropriated or reserved by the United States for any purpose, or to which a homestead or preemption right had not attached, prior to the definite location of the road proposed to be aided. lb.
4. State appropriationof swamp or overflowed lands; what amounts to. A claim by a State that it is entitled to lands as swamp or overflowed
under the Swamp Land Act of September 28, 1850, c. 84, 9 Stat. 519, is not an appropriation or reservation if the land is not in fact swamp or overflowed and the claim sustained by a decision or ruling to that effect of competent authority. lb.
5. Swamp lands; identificationof; in whom duty reposed. Under the Swamp Land Act power to identify lands as swamp or over-
flowed within the meaning of the act is conferred solely on the Secretary of the Interior. (French v. Fyan, 93 U. S.169.) lb.
6. Mexican titles; effect of Gadsden Purchase Treaty; rights and duty of claimant.
Under the Gadsden Purchase Treaty with Mexico of December 30, 1853, 10 Stat. 1031, the good faith of the United States was pleaded to respect Mexican titles, and one whose title was absolutely perfected prior to the treaty was not bound to present his title for confirmation to the Court of Private Land Claims under the act of March 3, 1891; nor did the fact that he prayed for confirmation, in a suit brought by the United States against him in that court to declare the patent void or to determine boundaries if valid, limit

his claim to the recovery of the price specified in the act for land included within the grant but patented to others by the United States. Richardson v. Ainsa, 289.
7. Mexican titles; effect on claimant of appearance in Court of Private Land Claims.
While under § 14 of the act of March 3, 1891, where the claimant-of a Mexican land grant himself presented his claim to g, Mexican grant in the Gadsden Purchase to the Court of Private Land Claims he rmight be limited to recovery in the case of lands within his grant sold by the United States to the price specified in the act, where he is brought into the court by the United States in a suit attempting to set aside a grant title to which was perfected before the treaty, he is not so limited and patents issued by the United States to lands within the boundaries of his grant are mere usurpations and void. lb.

INDEMr
RAILROADS. I. Segregation of races; right to make rules and regulations as to. As held by the Court of Appeals of Kentucky, a railroad company has
the right, in that State, to establish rules and regulations which require white and colored passengers, even though they be interstate, to occupy separate apartments upon the train provided there is no discrimination in the accommodations. Chiles v. Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co., 71.
2. Same. In this case held that an interstate colored passenger was not com-
pelled to occupy a separate apartment on a train in Kentucky from that occupied by white passengers under a state statute but under rules and regulations of the railroad conpany. lb.
3. Same. Whether interstate passengers of different races, must have different
apartments or share the same apartment is a question of interstate commerce to be determined by Congress alone, Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Mississippi, 133 U. S. 587, and the inaction of Congress in that regard is equivalent to the declaration that carriers can by reasonable regulations separate colored and white passengers. lb.
4. Reasonableness of regulations based on sentiment of community. Regulations which are induced by the general sentiment of the com-
munity for whom they are made and upon whom they operate cannot be said to be unreasonable. Ib.
5. Acceptance of franchise; conditions imposed thereby. A railway corporation accepts its franchise from the State subject to
the condition that it will conform at its own expense to any regulations as to the opening or use of streets which are reasonable and proper and have for their object public safety and convenience and which may, from time to time, be established by the municipality, within whose limits the company operates, proceeding, under legislative authority. Cincinnati, I. & W. Ry. Co. v. Connersville, 336.

STARE DECISIS. 1. Flexibility of rule. The rule of stare decisis tends to uniformity and consistency of dedision
but it is not inflexible, and it is within the discrdtion of a court to follow or depart from its prior decisions. Hertzsv. Woodman, 205.
2. Effect of affirmance by divided court. While, the affirmance of a judgment by this court by a divided court
is a conclusive adjudication between the parties, it is not an authority on the principles of law involved for the determination of other cases in this or in inferior courts; and this, although a different rule has been sanctioned in England. Ib.

STATES. 1. Police power to fix rates of interest on money loaned. Fixing maximum rates of interest on money loaned within the, State
by persons subject to its jurisdiction is clearly within the police power of the State, and the details are within legislative discretion if not unreasonably land arbitrarily exercised. - Griffith v. Connecticut, 563.
2. Police power to regulate tradesandcallings concerning public health. The police power of the State particularly extends to regulating trades
and callings concerning public health, and practitioners of medicine are properly subject to police regulation, the Aetails of which are primarily with the legislature and: are not to be interfered with by the Federal courts so long as fundamental constitutional rights are 'not violated. (Dent v. West Virginia, 129 U. S.114.) Watson v. Maryland, 173.
3. Restridionsupon;,effect df act~of June 5,,_1868. Quwxre, whether the act of.June.25, 1868, c70,, 15SWtat..3, does restrict

4. Power to regulatethe miative ights and duties of sersons and corpmv tions within jurisdiction.
The power, whether called p1 e, 'governmental or legindive, exists in each State, by appropriate legislation not forbiddem bly its own, or the Federal, constitution to regulate the relative rights and duties of all persons and corporatiom within its jurisdiefian, And, there-

fore, to provide for the public good and convenience. (Lake Shore & Michigan Southern Ry. Co. v. Ohio, 173 U. S. 285, 298.) Cincinnati,I. & W. Ry. Co. v. Connersville, 336.
5. Taxation; limitation by State of power to determine property taxable by municipality.
A State by authorizing a municipality to levy taxes in the future on taxable property within its jurisdiction does not thereby limit its own power to determine what property shall be taxable when the levy shall be made. Arkansas Southern Ry. Co. v. Louisiana & Arkansas Ry. Co., 431.

6. Subserviency of subordinatebody in making contracts.

A subordinate body of the State, in the absence of the State distinctly

limiting its control thereover, contracts subject, and not para-

STATUTES.
A. CONSTRUCTION OF.
1. Repeals; effect of-Effect of § 13, Rev. Stat., as general saving clause. While an unqualified repeal of a law operates to destroy inchoate rights
as a release of imperfect obligations and as a remission of penalties and forfeitures dependent upon the destroyed statute, § 13, Rev. Stat., based on § 4 of the act of February 25, 1871, c. 71, 16 Stat. 431, operates, unless the repealing act does not expressly or by implication exclude such operation, as a general saving clause for all repealing statutes and extends not only to penalties and forfeitures but to liabilities under the repealed statute. (Great Northern Railway Co. v. United'States, 208 U. S. 452.) Hert 'v. Woodman, 205.
2. Separable provisions; when provisions construed as independent. Where the purpose of a state statute does not depend upon the in-
separableness of its punishments the fact that a statute providea both double damages and fine and imprisonment does not'neeessarily prevent a construction that the provisions are independent. Shevlin-CarpenterCo. v. Minnesota, 57.

INDEX.
3. When 8sate statute construed as regulation of commerce and not police measure.
A statute requiring interstate trains to stop at junction points for the convenience of passengers should be construed as a regulation of commerce and not as a police statute for the protection of life and limb. Herndon v. Chicago, R. I. & Pac. Ry. Co., 135; Roach v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co., 159.
4. Presumption againstintent to dismember water system. There is a presumption against an intent to dismember a complete
wate~rworks system, and an ordinance to purchase such a system will not be construed as requiring such dismemberment, even if the city had no power to use certain portions of the system. Omaha v. Omaha Water Co., 180.
5. Of statutes affecting relationof husband and ufe. Statutes passed in pursuance of a more liberal and general policy of
emancipation of the wife from the husband's control differ in terms and each must be construed with a view to effectuate the legislative intent leading to its enactment. Thompson v. Thompson, 611.
6. Influence of old law in construingone effecting change therein. In construing a statute the courts must have in mind the old law and
the change intended to be effected by the passage of the new. Ib. See FEDERAL QUESTION, 2; PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE, 2, 7, 8, 9, 12, 17, 18; TAXES AND TAXATION, 2.

TAXES AND TAXATION. I. Inheritancetax; liabilityunder War Revenue Act of 1898. Upon the passing by death of a vested right to the immediate posses-
sion or enjoyment of a legacy or distributive share there was imposed by the inheritance tax provisions of the War Revenue Act of 1898 the tax or duty exacted upon every such right of succession which was saved by the saving clause of the repealing act of April 12, 1902. Mason v. Sargent, 104 U. S. 689, distinguished. Hertz v. Woodman, 205.
2. Same. The fact that the testator died within one year immediately prior to
the taking effect of the repealing act of April 12, 1902, c. 500, 32 Stat. 96, does not relieve from taxation legacies otherwise taxable under §§29 and 30 of the War RevenueAct of June 13, 1898, c. 448, 30 Stat. 448, as amended by the act of March 2, 1901, c. 803, 31 Stat. 895. b.
3. Inheritancetax; applicationof limitation,as to payment. Although in the statute a time-limit as to payment of a tax upon dis-
tributive shares and legacies may refer to the death of the testator, it may be construed as applying to shares in intestate estates as well as to legacies from testators, the omission being supplied by necessary implication. Ib.
4. Effect of delay on validity of assessment. If the law of the State permits it, the fact that the making of an assess-

INDEX.

ment is delayed does not detract from the authority or the duty of

the assessing power to make it. Illinois Central"R.R. Co. v. Ken-
