No. 869. TINKOFF ET AL. V. GOLD, TRUSTEE, ET AL. On petition for writ of certiorari to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. May 12, 1941. PerCuriam: The motion to proceed in forma pauperis is granted. It appears that on a motion to vacate an order approving a supersedeas bond given on the appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals, the appeal was dismissed for failure of appellants to produce the surety on the bond as required by the court, and later the Circuit Court of Appeals denied appellants' motion to vacate that order of dismissal. The petition for certiorari is granted and the order of dismissal is reversed upon the ground that while the failure to produce the surety for examination was an adequate reason for vacating the approval of the supersedeas bond, it did not justify the dismissal of the appeal.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES,
Washington,D. C., June 2, 1941.

DEAR CHIEF JUSTICE: The announcement of your de-
cision to retire from the active duties of your office brings to us a deep sense of regret that our association with you in the daily work of the Court must end. In all the years of that association you have been tireless in carrying the heavy burden which unavoidably rests on the Chief Justice. With single-minded devotion to the high purpose of the Court you have brought to your leadership there all the resources gained from many years of eminent public and professional service, wide knowledge of the law, and that unflagging energy and painstaking care with which you have guided our deliberations with thoroughness and dispatch.
At this moment of parting we wish to assure you of the high regard and esteem in which we hold you and your distinguished services to the Court and to the country. We wish for you in the years to come unabated vigor and good health and the full enjoyment of the opportunity to continue to employ your talents in agreeable and useful accomplishment.
Faithfully yours,
HARLAN F. STONE.
OWEN J. RoBERs. HUGO L. BLACK.

I keenly regret the necessity of giving up the privilege of our daily association and I shall carry into my retirement an abiding and precious memory of the good will and friendly consideration you have invariably shown me in the intimacy of our common endeavor. Despite my withdrawal from active service, I trust that our companionship may still continue and I extend to each of you the assurance of my high esteem and my earnest wish for your health and happiness.
Faithfully yours, CHARLES E. HUGHES.
MR. JUSTICE STOWE. MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS. MR. JUSTICE BLACK.
