closely examined by Courts of Equity, and set aside if there be any ground to suppose that lie has abused the confidence reposed in him. When the proof is conflicting upon the point of undue influence exerted upon one making provision by deed in favor of the person alleged to have exerted the influence, and it appears that the contestant, having full knowledge of all the circumstances, made no averment in his original bill of the incapacity of the grantor, and did not raise that issue until an amended bill was filed a year later, that fact is entitled to weight in determining the case. When incapacity caused by drunkenness is alleged as a cause for annulling a deed, the vital inquiry is as to the capacity of the grantor when the deeds were executed, and not as to his capacity when drunk. Section 2666 of the Code of Georgia, relating to gifts made to a guardian by a minor just after arriving at majority does not apply to the case of a deed or will in favor of his guardian made by a person some years after arriving at his majority but even if it did apply such a deed would be good if made with a full knowledge of the facts, and without any misrepresentation or suppression of material facts by the guardian. As the record in this case discloses nothing impeaching the final settlement made betweeil the guardian and his ward, § 1847 of the Code of Georgia does not apply to it. Section 3177 of the Code of Georgia, relating to gifts from one party to another where, there are confidential relations arising from nature, or created by law or resulting from contracts where one party is so situated as to exercise a controlling influence over the other, is only a statement of a general rule, governing all courts of equity.

M. JusTIcE HAN delivered the opinion of the court.
This suit was brought by the widow of the late James A. Ralston, Jr., to obtain a decree cancelling certain deeds of gift of real estate, executed by her husband to the appellee, George B. Turpin, as trustee for his children. The original bill, filed August 7, 1883, sought this relief upon the ground that Turpin obtained the execution of the deeds by undue influence exercised by him over the grantor while the latter was in declining health, with a constitutlgn seriously impaired by dis-

Opinion of the Court.
sipation, and by the suppression of facts that were within his knowledge, and which, in view of his relations to the grantor, he was under obligation to disclose. In an amended bill, filed May 6, 1884, the grounds for cancellation were enlarged by an averment that at the time of signing the deeds the grantor was mentally incapable of comprehending and did not comprehend what he was doing, and that plaintiff gave her apparent consent to their execution, because, knowing Turpin's power "over her husband, she feared to offend him lest he might either work a separation between her and her said husband, or render their relations with each other insecure and unhappy," and that "she and her husband were both overreached and deceived by the said Turpin, and yielded because they were in effect powerless to resist." By a subsequent amendment, made May 29, 1885, the plaintiff alleged as to the first deed that neither she nor her husband knew, at the time of its execution, whether it was a will or a deed, or what its legal effect was, and that both of them were so completely under Turpin's influence, and so anxious to conciliate and gratify him, that they did not stop to consider its character or effect, and had no opportunity to consult counsel with reference thereto. The answer put in issue all the material averments of the bill and amended bills.
The Circuit Court dismissed the suit, placing its decision upon two grounds first, that when the deeds were made the grantor was capable of disposing of his property as he thought proper; second, that its disposition was in conformity with the long settled and cherished purpose of his life, and was not brought about by a betrayal of trust or any improper influence upon the part of the grantee. 25 Fed.

The relations between the grantor and Turpin will appear from the following facts, some of which are conceded, while the others are established by a clear preponderance of edence.
James A. Ralston, Sr.. died in 1864, possessed of considerable property, principally real estate in Macon, Georgia, which passed, in equal parts, to his widow, and sole surviving child, James A. Ralston, Jr. During the lifetime of the father, Tur-

pin attended to a large part of his business, and held towards him relations of close friendship and confidence. After his death the management of the estate was committed by the legal representative of the father to Turpin, who collected rents, leased property and directed necessary repairs. In 186'r, the son, then about nineteen years of age, and having the right, under the laws of Georgia, to select his guardian, chose Turpin, without his solicitation, for that position. The latter qualified on the 2d of August, 1867. In the same year Mrs. Ralston, the mother, intermarried with Dr. Bozeman of New York.
On the 3d of May, 1869, Turpin, having made a final settlement of his accounts as guardian before the proper court, and turned over to his ward, who had then reached his majority, the property and assets belonging to the latter, received from that court a formal letter discharging him from the guardianship. Immediately after the relations of guardian and ward were thus severed, Turpin and his partner Ogden, composing the firm of Turpin & Ogden, were employed by young Ralston to take charge of his real estate, and to collect rents, make repairs, etc. In addition to the relations between him and Turpin, arising out of this employment, there existed between them a warm personal affection.
In 1873 the mother of Ralston died, leaving a will by which a considerable part of her estate was devised to him, and this, also, was committed by him to the management of Turpin & Ogden. By her will Turpin was made executor. He qualified, and, in 1878, having fully administered her estate, was discharged as executor. In this connection it may be stated that Mrs. Bozeman told Turpin that he was not remembered in her will, because "Jimmie had or would do so in his," she observing, at the time, that he had been a good friend to the family This is stated by Turpin, in his deposition, and there is no reason to doubt the truth of his statement.
On the 11th of May, 1874 Ralston, being about twenty-six years of age and then competent to dispose of his property, and having an estate yielding him an annual income of about $15,000, made, at Macon, Georgia, and without suggestion by

RALSTON v. TURPIN.
Opinion of the Court.
Turpin, his will and testament whereby he directed that a monument, suitable to his condition and circumstances of life, be erected over his grave, and requested that his "friend, George B. Turpm, and his children after him," would see to it that his "monument and grave shall always during their lives be suitably kept and cared for." By that will he also directed, that after the payment of his debts his entire estate be divided into two equal parts, one part to go to George B. Turpin, in trust for the sole benefit and use of the testator's aunt, Mrs. Laura B. Smith, and her children, James, Annie, Daisy and Charles, during her natural life, and after her death, for the joint and sole use and benefit of those children, and their respective descendants, during the life of the child longest surviving, and upon the death of the last survivor, to the heirs at law of his aunt. The other part was devised to Turpm for the sole benefit and use of himself and children (born, and to be born) for and during his life, the trust to cease at his death and the property to vest in his children then in life, the descendants of any deceased child to share in the division per stzrpe. Turpin and Ogden were constituted his executors.
On the 15th of December, 1879, Ralston, then nearly thirtytwo years of age, made, at the city of Nfew York, a second will, revoking all other wills, and devising to Turpin, "Im trust for his children, William C. Turpin, Frank M. Turpin, George R. Turpin, Lizzie Turpin and Walter H. Turpin," the building at the corner of Cherry and Third Streets, in Macon, known as Ralston Hall, together with the adjoining lots, 66, 68 and 70, subject only to such liens and incumbrances as might be created thereon during his lifetime. This property is variously estimated to have been worth between $40,000 and $50,000, and constituted, at that time, according to the weight of the evidence, less than one half in value of his estate. He then devised to "Ida Blanchard, by which name she is now known, and whose original name was Sarah or Sally J Harten, formerly of Philadelphia, Pa.," four stores in Macon, and all the watches and jewelry of which he should die possessed. To his aunt Mrs. Smith, during her natural life, and at her death to her children in fee simple, he bequeathed his undivided one

half interest in the Ralston mansion house in Macon. To his grandmother, during her natural life, he devised all of the family pictures of which he should die possessed, and at her death "to my friend, George B. Turpm, of Macon, Ga., having enjoyed his friendship for a long course of years. I feel that they will be safe and kept intact in his hands." To Qgden he devised all of the household furniture in the Ralston mansion house.
It is here necessary to state that the plaintiff, under the name of Ida Blanchard3 went to Macon in 1869, and lived continuously in houses of public prostitution. While prosecuting that mode of life, young Ralston made her acquaintance, and for several years, without intermission, and much to the grief of relatives and friends, held improper relations with her. They often quarrelled and had drunken broils with each other in different places of bad repute where they met. Durmg her residence in Macon, Turpin used every effort to induce Ralston to abandon the reckless and immoral life he was leading, and to cease the use of strong drink. But his efforts and warnings were unattended with success, except for brief intervals. No change occurred in the relations of Ralston and the plaintiff while in M acon. She states that he intended to marry her as far back as 1876. In the fall of 1879 they went to New York, and on the 23d of January, 1880, within less than three weeks after the will of 1879 was made, they were married. The fact of their marriage was not known in Macon until some months afterwards. In April, 1880, they removed to Stamford, Conn. In the summer of that year, Turpin, while at Saratoga Springs, received information of the marriage, and that they were living in Stamford. He went to the latter place in August, 1880, to ascertain if such were the fact, and, if it were, to inform Ralston that his marriage had, by the laws of Georgia, revoked the will made in favor of Turpin's children, and to suggest the propriety, if he still desired to do something for them, of making a formal deed for their benefit. There is some conflict between the statements of the plaintiff and Turpin as to what occurred at Stamford. But it is evident that nothing was said or done by Turpin, on that occasion, calculated to influence

RALSTON v. TURPIN.
Opinion of the Court.
Ralston or his wife to take any course not entirely in accordance with their wishes. Nor is there any ground to suppose that the plaintiff acquiesced in what her husband did from fear that Turpin might expose her course of life, or effect a separation between herself and husband. It does not appear that she stood in fear of anybody It is clearly shown that, as the result of the interview at Stamford, Ralston and wife went to New York, and, before a commissioner of the State of Georgia, freely and voluntarily executed and acknowledged a deed, in fee simple, dated August 26, 1880, conveying to Turpin, as trustee for his children, William, Frank, George, Lizzie and Walter the identical property devised to him as trustee by the will of 1879, subject, however, to the condition that Ralston should receive annually its rents, uses and profits, after deducting taxes and insurance thereon, and expenses for collecting the rents and making 'repairs, and subject to a mortgage of $ 5000 made by Ralston to Ross, on one of the stores conveyed to Turpin as trustee. Two days afterwards, August 28, 1880, another deed, covering the same property and containing the same conditions, was executed and acknowledged by Ralston, the first deed having been discovered, or being supposed, to be informal in. some respects. On the day of the execution of each of these deeds the plaintiff executed and acknowledged, before the same commissioner, a separate instrument in writlug, stating that she freely and voluntarily ratified and confirmed the deed made by her husband.
In the year 1881, Turpin, having been advised by counsel that the former deeds for the benefit of his children were defective, in that their clauses, or some of them, were of a testamentary character, enclosed another deed for Ralston to execute, which the latter did on the 19th of April, 1881; the plaintiff executing on the same day a separate writing ratifying and confirming that deed, and renouncing and conveying to the trustee for the uses therein named all her right of dower and other interests in the property conveyed. This deed conveyed to Turpmn in trust for his children named in those instruments the same property as that described in the will of 1879, and in the deeds of August 26, 1880, and August 28, 1880.

OCTOBER TERM, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.
In this connection it may be stated that prior to the making of the will of 1879, Ralston became unfriendly tc the husband of one of the daughters of Turpin, and, for that reason, she was omitted from that will as well as from -all the deeds subsequently executed. He died at Montclair, New Jersey, on the 4th of July, 1883.
We must examine each -of the principal grounds upon which the plaintiff bases her claim for relief, for, if, as contended, IRalston was in such condition, mentally and physically, when the deeds of 1880 and 1881 were executed, that he could not or did not comprehend the nature of the transactions, or if their execution was obtained by means of undue influence exercised over him by Turpin, in either case, the plaintiff would be entitled to relief. It would be granted upon the principle laid down in Hardingv Bandy, 11 Wheat. 103, 125, which was a suit by heirs at law to set aside conveyances obtained from their ancestor. Chief Justice Marshall there said "If these deeds were obtained by the exercise of undue influence over a man whose mind had ceased to be the safe guide of his actions, it is against conscience for him who has obtained them to derive any advantage from them. It is the peculiar province of a courtof conscience to set them aside." Allore v Jewell, 94 T S. 506, 511. On the contrary, if it does not appear that he was incapable, by reason of physical or mental debility, of exercising a discriminating judgment in respect to the disposition of his property, or was driven to make the gifts in question against his own wishes, and under some influence that he was unable, no matter from what cause, to resist, the relief asked must be denied. "The undue influence for which a will or deed will be annulled," this court said in Conley v -Nailor1,18 U. S. 127, 134, "must be such as that the party making it has no free will, but stands s2fn-
In a case of conflicting proof, as here, it is a circumstance not without weight, that the plaintiff, who, more than any one else, was cognizant of the grantor's condition during the entire period in question, makes no averment in the original bill of the husband's want of capacity to dispose of his prop-

RALSTON v. TURPIN.
Opinion of the Court.
erty The averment was that when the deeds were made he was in a declining state of health, and his constitution greatly weakened by dissipation. Such a condition does not, however, necessarily imply an absence of sufficient capacity to dispose of property, by gift or otherwise. Nearly a year passed after the institution of this suit, before she distinctly made the issue that the deeds were void for the want of capacity upon the part of her husband to make them. The proof does show, beyond question-indeed, it is admitted-that for many years prior to the execution of the deeds, and thenceforward until his death in 1883, he was intemperate in his use of ardent spirits. He was often intoxicated, and, when in that condition, was incapacitated to transact business. But for many years prior to Ins death there were intervals, some of them quite long, during which he avoided excessive indulgence in strong drink. His capacity, when sober, to transact business is abundantly shown. The vital inquiry is as to his capacity, not when he was intoxicated, but when the deeds were executed. Conley v .ftailor, 118 U. S. 127, 131. The evidence leaves no room to doubt that, at those particular dates he fully comprehended the character of those instruments. If it satisfactorily appeared that, from habitual dissipation or other cause, he was in such enfeebled condition of mind or body, immediately before or immediately after their execution, as to render him incompetent to transact business, the presumption might arise that he was unable, at the time, to understand what he was doing, and thus the burden of proof, as to his capacity, at those particular dates, to dispose of his property, be imposed upon the grantee. Even in that view, the plaintiff would not be entitled to a decree cancelling the deeds, on the ground of the grantor's mental incapacity, for it appears that, on each occasion when the respective deeds were executed, he was perfectly sober, and possessed sufficient capacity to dispose of his property with an intelligent understanding of what he was doing. He knew, at the time, that each deed conveyed certain property to Turpin in trust for the children named, and that they were substantially in execution of his settled purpose to make provision

OCTOBER TERM, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.
out of his estate for the children of the man who had been for years the fast friend and confidential adviser of his parents and of himself. That purpose was based upon motives entirely creditable to him, and, so far as the record discloses was originally formed without any suggestion by Turpin or his children. Prior to his leaving Macon in 1879, and before making the will of that year, he often said to companions or acquaintances that he intended to make, or had made, such provision out of his estate.
If he executed the deeds of 1880 without knowing what be was doing, he would, naturally, at some subsequent time, have expressed dissatisfaction with what he had done, and taken steps to have them set aside. But no expression of dissatisfaction was ever made by him. On the contrary, upon receiving the deed of 1881, accompanied by the request that he would execute it, he promptly complied with that request, and returned the deed duly acknowledged by himself and wife to Turpin. His correspondence with the latter during 1880 and 1881 furnishes persuasive, if not conclusive, evidence that he had accurate knowledge of the condition of his property and its management by Turpin & Ogden, under the direction of Turpin, and was in the enjoyment of good health. On July 28, 1880, within less than a month before making the first deed of gift, he wrote to Turpin from Stamford, Connecticut, stating, among other things, that he was "enjoying good health." On April 18, 1881, the day preceding the last deed of gift, he wrote from the same place to Turpin, "my health is splendid, but Ida has been ill all winter and is so still." The body of each of these letters isin the handwriting of the complainant. They are inconsistent with her present contention that, not only at the time, but both before and after, the deeds of gift were executed, her husband's mind and body had been so wrecked by dissipation that he did not intelligently comprehend what be did, or possess sufficient will to resist the importunities or persuasion of others. To these considerations we may add the significant fact that in no one of the letters that passed between Turpin and the plaintiff, after the latter left Macon, is there any intimation that she disapproved of the

provision made for Turpin's children. We concur entirely with the conclusion reached upon this issue by the court below
It remains to consider whether the deeds of gift were the result of undue influence exercised by Turpin over Ralston. In discussing this question counsel for the plaintiff call attention to § 2666 of the Code of Georgia, which provides that "a gift by any person just arrived at majority, or otherwise peculiarly subject to be affected by such influences, to his parent, guardian, trustee, attorney, or other person standing in a similar relationship of confidence, shall be scrutinized with great
jealousy, and upon the slightest evidence of persuasion or influence towards this object, shall be declared void, at the instance of the donor or his legal representative, at any time within five years after the making of such gift." We do not perceive that this provision has any direct bearing upon this case. There was here no gift by the ward just after he arrived at his majority If the deeds in question had been made immediately upon Ralston's arriving at full age, or shortly after he came into possession of his estate, they would, in view of the then recent relation of guardian and ward, have been more difficult to sustain. Still they would have been sustained if it had appeared that they were freely and voluntarily made, upon full knowledge of the facts, without misrepresentation or suppression of material facts by the guardian. In _Myltom v Hylton, 2 Yes. Sen. 5,17, 549, Lord Chancellor Hardwicke said. "Undoubtedly, if after the ward or cestut que trust comes of age, and after actually put into possession of the estate, he thinks fit, when suz jurw, and at liberty, to grant that or any
other reasonable grant by way of reward for care and trouble, when done with eyes open, the court could never set that aside, but the court guards against doing it at the. very time of accounting and delivering up the estate, as the terms, for the court will not suffer them to make that the terms of doing
their duty" In the case before us more than eleven years elapsed after Ralston attained full age, and after Turpin finally settled his accounts as guardian,. before the first of the deeds of gift was made.
In respect to that settlement it may be observed that by
VOL. cxxix-43

OCTOBER TERMI, 1888.
Oplon of the Court.
§ 1847 of the Georgia Code it is declared that "no final set-
tlement made between the guardian and ward shall bar the ward, at any time within four years thereafter, from calling the guardian to a settlement of his accounts, unless it is made to appear that the same was made after a full exhibit of all the guardian's accounts, and with a full knowledge by the ward of his legal rights." Nothing is disclosed by the record that impeaches the entire accuracy of the guardian's final settlement, nothing that suggests any -want of intelligence or integrity in his administration of the ward's estate, nothing to show that he ever realized anything from the position of guardian, except such compensation as the law permitted him to receive. When, therefore, the relation of guardian and ward was severed, Ralston had every reason to confide in Tur pin's integrity, and to feel grateful, not only for his uniform kindness, but for faithful devotion to his interests.
But it is contended that the relations subsequently existing between them were such as are described in § 3177 of the Georgia Code, which declares that "any relations shall be deemed confidential arising from nature or created by law, or resulting from contracts, where one party is so situated as to exercise a controlling influence over the will, conduct and interest of another; or where, from similar relations of mutual confidence the law requires the utmost good faith, such as partners, principal and agent, etc." Undoubtedly, the relation of principal and agent existed between Ralston and Turpin after the relation of guardian and ward had been severed, and up to the death of Ralston. The section of the Georgia Code quoted is an expression of a general rule that has always governed courts of equity The agent is bound to act with absolute good faith toward the principal in respect to every matter entrusted to his care and management. In accepting a gift from his principal he is under an obligation to withhold no information in his possession respecting the subject of the gift, or the condition of the estate in his hands, which good faith requires to be disclosed, or that may reasonably influence the judgment of the principal in making the gift. All transactions between them whereby the agent derives advantages beyond

Opinion of the Court.
legitimate compensation for his services will be closely examined by courts of equity, and set aside if there be any ground to suppose that he has abused the confidence reposed in him. It is for the common security of mankind, Mr. Justice Story well says, "that gifts procured by agents, and purchases made by them, from their principals, should be scrutinized with a close and vigilant suspicion." 1 Story's Eq. Jur. § 315. _An instructive case upon this point is Harrm v Temenheere, 15 Yes. 3M, 38, which was a suit to cancel leases to a party who, at the time, held the relation of steward, agent, and attorney to the lessor. Some of the leases were pure gifts by the employer. Lord Chancellor Eldon disclaimed any jurisdiction-to annul such gifts, when based upon the generosity of the donor, or to weigh the value or amount of the consideration, as if it had been the subject of barter, but said, that if lie could find "in the answer or the evidence the slightest hint" that the defendant had laid before his employer an account of the value of the premises that was not perfectly accurate, he would set aside such leases. He would do this, he said, without regard to the intention of the parties, "upon the general ground that the principal would never be safe if the agent could take a gift from him upon a representation that was not most accurate and precise."
We do not intend to qualify or weaken, in any degree, these salutary doctrines. Their recognition, however, does not determine the present case, unless it be held that a principal cannot, under any circumstances whatever, make a valid gift to his agent of property committed to the latter's care or management. No such doctrine has ever been established, nor could it be, without impairingthe natural right of an owner to make such disposition of his property as he may think would best subserve his interest and comfort or gratify his feelings. That Turpin held such relations, personal and otherwise, to young IRalston, as would enable him to exercise great influence over the latter in respect to the mode in which his property should be managed for purposes of revenue, that Ralston trusted Turpin's judgment as to matters of business more than the judgment of any other man, and that he had an abiding con-

OCTOBER TERM, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.
fidence in Turpi's integrity, as well as in his desire to protect his interests, are conceded. But we are satisfied that Turpin did not improperly use the influence he had over, or abuse the confidence reposed in him by, young Ralston. It was the latters own thought, induced, no doubt, by his friendly feeling for Turpin and gratitude for the latter's fidelity to his interests, to make some provision for Turpm's family This thought was first formally expressed in the will of 1874, when he was capable of making a disposition of his property It was substantially repeated in the will of 1879, drawn in precise conformity with his directions. The circumstances detailed by the plaintiff's counsel to show that the deeds of 1880 and 1881 were procured by undue influence upon the part of Turpm, lose most of their force in view of the fact that they covered the same property and name the same beneficiaries that are described in the will of 1879. That Turpin caused the first deed to be prepared, and requested Ralston to execute it, are facts of but little weight. Turpin had been informed of the will of 1879, and it was his right, if not his duty to his children, to irforin Ralston that his marriage had revoked that will, and to suggest that, if he was so minded, the execution of a deed was an appropriate mode to give effect to his intention in respect to those children. Nor was the presence in Stamford, when the deeds of 1880 were executed, of Ogden, the partner of Turpin, a suspicious circumstance. The correspondence between Ralston and Turpin, prior to that time, shows that the former was aware of Ogden's purpose to visit the North during the summer of 1880, and desired Ogden to visit him at Stamford.
Upon a careful examination of the record, we concur with the court below in holding that the plaintiff has failed to show that the deeds of 1880 and 1881 were obtained by undue influence. On the contrary, it appears, by the great preponderance of evidence, (to state the case made by the defendants in no stronger language,) that, although their execution may have been induced, not unnaturally, by feelings of friendship for, and gratitude to, the defendant Turpin, the grantor acted upon his own independent, deliberate judgment, with full

knowledge of the nature and effect of the deeds. It was for the donor, who had sufficient capacity to take a survey of his estate, and to dispose of it according to an intelligent, fixed purpose of his own, regardless of the wishes of others, to determine how far such feelings should control him when selecting the objects of his bounty
In respect to the allegation that Turpm suppressed facts touching the condition of Ralston's estate, as affected by the claim of Mrs. Smith, it is sufficient to say that it is not sustained by the proof.
Other facts than those we have mentioned are disclosed by the record, and other questions were discussed at the bar, but as they do not, in our judgment, materially affect the decision of the case, we need not specially refer to them.

In a suit in equity in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia it is competent, under the acts of Congress, for a married woman, who is a party thereto, to disclose, as a witness, directions given by her to her husband respecting the investment of her separate property, though she could not be compelled to make such disclosure against her wishes. Rev. Stat. Dist. Col. §§ 876, 877.
There is no higher presumption that a married woman in the District of Columbia intends, by placing her separate money in the hands of her husband, thereby to make a gift of it to him, than there is that a third person has such intent when he in like manner deposits money with him. 16 Stat. 45, c. 23.
In the District of Columbia, whenever a husband acquires possession of the separate property of his wife, whether with or without her consent, he must be deemed to hold it in trust for her benefit, in the absence of any direct evidence that she intended to make a gift of it to him.
THE court, in its opinion, stated the case as follows:
This suit was brought by the complainant below, appellee here, Jeannie K. Stickney, widow of William Stickney, who died in October, 1881, against certain of his heirs, to establish ,her claim as creditor for the sum of about seventy-nine thousand dollars against the estate, real and personal, held in the name of her husband at the time of his death, and to obtain a decree that said estate be applied to its payment, except so far as may be necessary to discharge his just debts. Her conten-

tion is, that all that estate was acquired by her husband with her moneys received by her as legatee under the will of her deceased father, Amos Kendall, and which were delivered to him to invest for her benefit and in her name, but which without her knowledge, and contrary to her directions, he used and invested in his own name.
Complainant intermarried with William Stickney in January, 1852, and continued his wife until his death in October, 1881. They resided in the District of Columbia, and their married life was one of mutual confidence and affection, nothing ever occurring to mar its happiness. From his marriage to 1857 he was, the greater part of the time, a clerk in the government service. In that year he became secretary of Mr. Kendall, and continuet so until the latter's death in November, 1869, receiving a monthly salary of $100, or, as supposed by one of his brothers, a yearly salary of $1500, himself and wife living with and receiving their board from M r. Kendall. Whilst secretary of M r. Kendall he received no salary from any other source. He had, however, accumulated a small amount of property, chiefly in lands, but it appears to have been acquired from moneys or proceeds of property given to his wife by her father, or from moneys furnished by him. It is not, however, important for the disposition of the present case to determine whether he had, previous to the death of Mr. Kendall, property in his own right, and if so, the extent of it. The question is, did he receive moneys of his wife to invest for her benefit, which he used and invested in his own name, and, if so, whether the estate which he left standing in his name can be subjected to the payment of the amount thus received.
Mr. Kendall left at his death an estate worth nearly half a million of dollars. By his will he made his four daughters residuary legatees, and provided that payment of any debts which might be due to him from any of theni should not be required in money, but should be adjusted in the distribution to them of certain specified bonds. He appointed as executors 'Mr. Stickney and Mr. Robert C. Fox, his sons-in-law. His will was admitted to probate, and letters testamentary were issued to them. The distributive share which came to Mrs.

STICKNEY v. STICKNEY.
Statement of the Case.
Stickney from her father's estate amounted to nearly eighty thousand dollars in money or its equivalent. Mr. and Mrs. Stickney had one son and to him Mrs. Stickney desired in 1879 to make a Christmas present of $1000. At her request Mr. Stickney sent her the money for that purpose. It appears also that Mrs. Stickney received from him at different times checks amounting to $600. No other sum except these is shown to have been paid by him to her of the means she received from her father. The whole went into his hands under directions, and with the understanding, as she asserts, that it was to be invested by him for her benefit and in her name. When she wanted the $1000 mentioned, she wrote to him the following letter : -
"December 23, 1879. "DPAn WILL: I wish ' Will' to have $1000 of the Chicago payment for his Christmas gift. Please bring check for the amount, and the balance invest in my name, as I have asked you to do with all other moneys accruing from my inheritance.
"JEANIE."
The evidence that Mrs. Stickney expected that her husband would invest her money for her benefit in her name, and that he understood that to make such investment was his duty, consists not merely in her declarations, but in the statements of Stickney himself, made at different times to parties with whom he was dealing. The instances of this kind are numerous, and in their combined force, considered with the presumption attendant on the receipt of money where there is no relation of debtor and creditor between the parties, that the receiver is to hold it subject to the other's order or to invest it for his use, remove all reasonable doubt on the subject. How far the presumptions thus raised are to be deemed rebutted by the fact that there is no proof of any express promise on Stickney's part to comply with her request, and by her failure to call for any account from him or statement as to the investments made, will be hereafter considered. It would seem that the confidence in her husband prevented any suspicion that

OCTOBER TERAI, 1888.
Statement of the Case.
her wishes as to the investment of her moneys had not been respected.
The illness of which Mr. Stickney died created no apprehension 'until within a few hours before his death. He then handed to his wife the keys to his box in the Safe Deposit Company, with instructions to retain them and examine his papers. . Upon their examination after his funeral, none were found showing any property in her name; all the property which he held stood in his own name. He died intestate, leaving as his sole heirs and next of kin three brothers and four children of a deceased brother, two of whom were minors. She was appointed administratrix of his estate. The three brothers, upon being acquainted with the situation of affairs, and the fact that the moneys received by her from her father had been used and invested by the deceased in his own name, immediately relinquished to her all their claims to his estate, by a conveyance reciting that he had left in his individual name real and personal property acquired from the proceeds of her sole and separate estate, and formally recognizing her beneficial interest therein. By this conveyance Mrs. Stickney became the owner in her own right of three-fourths of her husband's estate absolutely, with a right of dower in the remaining fourth of the real estate, and her distributive share in the personalty. She thereupon, to avoid any litigation over the property with the relatives of her husband, offered to recognize the claims of the infant children of the deceased brother, and to make reasonable compensation to the adult children, provided they would execute a release to her of their claims. The adults declined to execute such a release upon those terms, and the infants were incompetent to do so. Mrs. Stickney accordingly filed the present bill against the four children to determine the controversy, and the justice of her claim to be paid out of the estate of her husband as its creditor, the amount received by him from her separate property, after deducting the $1600 mentioned, which she had received" from him.
The adult children answered the bill denying the equities claimed, and pleading the statute of limitations against their

STICKNEY v. STICKNEY.
Statement of the Case.
assertion. The minor children, by their guardians ad litem, also answered the bill, claiming such interest in the premises as they might be entitled to, and submitting themselves to the protection of the court.
In October, 1882, on motion of the complainant and with the consent of the solitors of the adult defendants and of the guardians ad litegn of the infant defendants, the case was referred to the auditor of the court to ascertain and report, upon the evidence to be produced before him, among other things, whether the complainant was a creditor of, or entitled to repayment out of, the estate of her deceased husband, and if so, to what amount, liberty being given to state any special circumstances.
Much testimony was taken by the auditor, and the books of account of the executors of the estate of Amos Kendall and also of William Stickney were produced before him. He reported that the proceeds of the estate of Amos Kendall which came into the hands of his executors were from time to time divided among the legatees, and upon the receipts of the complainant to the executors her share was delivered to her husband, who used and invested the same in his own name without the knowledge of the complainant and in contravention of her express directions; that the books of William Stickney, deceased, showed in most instances the specific use made by him of the moneys which were the share of the complainant, derived from her father's estate; that the complainant never assented to or acquiesced in the use or investment of the property by her husband in his own name; that she intended to retain the apparent as well as the real ownership, the nominal as well as the equitable right; and that he considered himself as her trustee and proclaimed himself as such. The auditor, in applying the act of Congress passed on the 10th of April, 1869, commonly known as the Married Woman's Act, to the facts of the case, held that Mr. Stickney received the moneys as her agent and trustee, and was liable to account to her as such. and that no appropriation or investment by him without authority from her relieved him from such accountability. He reported also that the amount which Mr. Stickney

Argument for Appellants.

had received of the moneys belonging to her from her father's estate was $79,971.13, from which he deducted the $1600 mentioned, and found a balance due to her of $78,371.13.
To the plea of the statute of limitations, which was urged by the defendants in bar of the complainant's claim, the auditor replied that there were several answers: first, the complainant's disability by reason of her coverture; second, the character of the indebtedness, which had its origin in a relation of trust; and, third, that not until the death of her husband did she discover that her property was not invested or held in her own name. He, therefore, reported that the complainant was a creditor, and entitled to repayment, out of the estate of her deceased husband, of the amount found to be due to her for moneys received by him which came to her from the estate of her father.
Exceptions were taken to this report, which were heard at a special term of the court, and overruled, and a decree was entcred thereon for the complainant, that William Stickney, her husband, was justly indebted to her at the time of his death in the sum of $78,371.13 ; that no portion of it had been paid or satisfied; that, as administratrix of the personal estate of her deceased husband, she was entitled, in the regular course of her administration, to devote to the reduction of the said indebtedness, as against the defendants, and each of them, the undistributed balance of the personal estate in her hands, ascertained by the report of the auditor to be $32,202.08 ; that she be permitted to withdraw from the register of the court $2650.26, previously paid into it by her, after deducting the clerk's fees; and that the real estate of the said William Stickney at the time of his death, or so much thereof as might be necessary, be sold for the payment of the commutation of her dower therein, and the balance of said indebtedness. On appeal to the court in general term this decree was affirmed. To review that decree the case is brought by appeal here.

cluded on the ground of public policy, 1 Greenl. Ev. 254, 334, 343; and that disability is not removed by §§ 876 and 877 of the Revised Statutes of the District of Columbia. Eoltzrn v. Wagner, 5 Mackey, 15; Lucas v. Brooks, 18 Wall. 436, 452.
In Jacobs v. Hesler, 113 Mass. 157, a wife testified before the auditor that she gave money of her separate estate to her husband, to invest for her in United States bonds, which he promised to do, but did not do, but used the money in his business. The auditor reported the facts as above, if her testimony as to conversations between her husband and herself was competent; if not, then he found the fact to be that she placed the money in her husband's hands without any agreement, and that he used it in his business. The Supreme Court of Massachusetts held the conversations incompetent. Mr. Justice Gray said: "It must be deemed incompetent evidence as a conversation between husband and wife."
II. The essential facts establishedby the evidence do not make Mrs. Stickney a creditor of her husband's estate.
At common law all the personal property and money of the wife which was reduced to possession by the husband became bsolutely his. Tower v. lfagner, 3 Whart. 48; .eser v. Trigg, 98 U. S. 50. In equity, however, the wife might have a separateestate which was not subject to the control of the husband and of which she had the absolutejus disponendi as if she were feme sole. Caton v. 1ideout, 1 McN. and G. 599. This separate estate was usually settled upon trustees for her use, but might be vested in herself without the intervention of trustees. Hardy v. Fan Harlinge4,7 Ohio St. 208; Jones v. Clttan, 101 U. S. 225. As to the control and dis"posalof the income of her separateestate she was as independent of the control of her husband as though she were feme sole. .Muller v. Bayley, 21 Gratt. 521; Hardy et al. v. Van Harlingen,uli supra. She might loan the income of her separate estate to her husband and take his note or bond for it, or she might give it to him. She might be a creditor of her husband, as to this, and enforce the obligation.
The Married Woman's Act of the District of Columbia is contained in §§ 727 to 730 inclusive, Rev. Stat. Dist. Col.

OCTOBER TERM, 1888.
Argument for Appellants.
By this act the wife becomes the absolute owner of all her property, real and personal by operation of law, and her separate estate is no longer confined to the estate which was settled to her use by deed or devise, and she now has the jus disponendi of the principal as well as the income. She may deal as to her separate property with all the world, including her husband, she may loan it, or give to her husband or anybody else without limit or restraint. So far the construction of these modern enabling acts is uniform.
As to what acts or facts will be construed into a gift or loan from the wife to the husband, there is some diversity in the decisions of the courts in the different States where these acts have been adopted. The only cases cited by the auditor to sustain his conclusion that the use by the husband of his wife's money by her consent, without more, made him her trustee for the money, and made him or his estate liable to her as a debtor, are J-ohnston v. Joknston, 31 Penn. St. 450; Go cenauer's Estate,23 Penn. St. 460; Grabillv. .Moyer, 45 Penn. St. 530.
It will not be controverted but that the weight of authority in Pennsylvania sustains the auditor; but there are even there cases which do not. See .[Vagle v. Ingersoll, 7 Penn. St. 204.
This Pennsylvania doctrine is opposed to the line of decisions in Maryland, from which the District of Columbia derives its jurisprudence. Grover & Baker Sewing 1fachine Co. v. Padelif,63 Maryland, 496; Farmers' and .Merochints' -Bank v. Jenkins, 65 Maryland, 245.
In Jenkins v. -Middleton, 68 Maryland, 540, decided in 1888, the Court of Appeals said: "It is settled upon the soundest reasons, that if a man uses the money of his wife with her* acquiescence, she does not acquire a claim against him or his estate, unless at the time of the receiving or using of the money he made her an express promise to repay it." "It is useless to agitate the question because it is the settled law of the court. Not to speak of former decisions, it has recently been declared in Grover & Baker Sewing .Machine Co. v. Radcli , 63 Maryland, 496; Farmers' and Jtechanics' Bank v. Jenkins, 65 Maryland, 24:5. It is vain to argue that M1id-

dleton loaned the money to himself and his partner jointly. He could not become a sole debtor or a joint debtor to his wife without an eapresspomise.'
This doctrine prevails in the other States and in England. .onroe v. May, 9 Kansas, 466; Logan v. Hill, 19 Iowa, 491; ,acobs v. Hesler, 113 Mass. 157; Caton v. Rideout, 1 McN. & G. 597; fAfuller v. Bayley, 21 Grattan, 529; Hardy v. 'Fan Hfarlingen, 7 Ohio St. 209.
The circumstances of this case show that Mr. Stickney used the money of his wife as husband, and not as trustee. Consequently he, in his lifetime, was not responsible to her for it, nor is his estate since his decease.
III. Since the enabling statutes, the wife is sui juris as to her separate property, and may sue in her own name any one who interferes with it, even her husband. She may loan her separate money to her husband and enforce payment as against a stranger. Emerson v. Clayton, 32 Illinois, 493; .Monroe v. 3fay, ubi supra; -Druryv. Briscoe,42 Maryland, 151.
IV. The disability of a married woman being removed, the statute of limitations so far as her separate property is concerned, applies to her as well as to any other person. Castner v. Walrod, 83 Illinois, 171; Wilson v. Wilson, 36 California, 450; S. C. 95 Am. Dec. 194.
-M'.John Selden for appellee.
M. JUSTICE FIELD, after stating the case as above reported, delivered the opinion of the court.
The exceptions to the auditor's report, calling for consideration, are founded upon two grounds: one, the supposed incompetency of the complainant to testify as to directions given to her husband to invest moneys of her separate estate for her benefit and in her name; and the other, the supposed conclusiveness of the presumption that moneys belonging to the separate estate of the wife, when she allows her husband to use them, become gifts to him.

OCTOBER TERiM, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.
The general rule of the common law is, that neither husband nor wife is admissible as a witness for or against each other in any case, civil or criminal. This exclusion, as Greenleaf says, is founded partly upon the identity of their legal rights and interests, and partly on principles of public policy, that the confidence existing between them shall be sacredly protected and cherished to the utmost extent, as being essential to the happiness of social life. But this doctrine has been modified in several States, in many particulars, by direct legislation upon the subject, such as that neither husband nor wife shall be compellable to disclose any communication made to him or her during the marriage, as in New York. A voluntary" statement is receivable under such a statute. Southwick v. Southwick, 2 Sweeny (N. Y.) 231. In some States the6statutes include only private conversations in the privilege, but not such as take place in the presence of others. Fay v. Guynon, 131 Mass. 31. The Revised Statutes of the United States relating to the District of Columbia, on the subject of witnesses, provide as follows:
"SEC. 876. On the trial of any issue joined, or of any matter or question, or on any inquiry arising in any suit, action or other proceeding in any court of justice in the District, or before any person having by law or by consent of parties, authority to hear, receive and examine evidence within the District, the parties thereto, and the.persons in whose behalf any such action or proceeding may be brought or defended, and all persons interested in the same, shall, except as provided in the following section, be competent and compellable to give evidence, either viva voce or by deposition, according to the practice of the court, on behalf of any of the parties to the action or other proceeding.
"SEc. 877. Nothing in the preceding section shall render any person who is charged with an offence in any criminal proceeding competent or compellable to give evidence for or gainst himself; Or render any person compellable to answer any question tending to criminate himself; Or render a husband competent or compellable to give evidence for or against his wife, or a wife competent or compellable to give evidence

STICKNEY v. STICKNEY.
Opinion of the Court.
for or against her husband, in any criminal proceeding or in any proceeding instituted in consequence of adultery; Nor shall a husband be compellable to disclose any communication made to him by his wife during the marriage, nor shall a wife be compellable to disclose any communication made to her by her husband during the marriage."
These provisions dispose of the objection of counsel. Mrs. Stickney was at liberty, though not compellable, to state the directions given by her to her husband respecting the investment of her money. And without this qualification of the rule of the common law we are inclined to think that the changed law respecting her separate property, created by the Married Woman's Act of April 10, 1869, c. 23, 16 Stat. 45, would require for its successful enforcement some modification of the common law rule as to a husband or wife being -a witness where a controversy arises between them relating to the disposition of her separate personal property. That property no longer, as at common law, vests in her husband by the marriage. That act provides as follows:
"SEc. 1. That, in the District of Columbia, the right of any married woman to any property, personal or real, belonging to her at the time of marriage, or acquired during marriage in any other way than by gift or conveyance from her husband, shall be as absolute as if she were fene sole, and shall not be subject to the disposal of her husband, nor be liable for his debts; but such married woman may convey, devise and bequeath the same, or any interest therein, in the same manner and with like effect as if she were unmarried.
"SEc. 2. That any married woman may contract, and sue and be sued, in her own name, in all matters having relation to her sole and separate property in the same manner as if she were unmarried; but neither her husband nor his property shall be bound by any such contract nor liable for any recovery against her in any such suit, but judgment may be enforced by execution against her sole and separate estate in the same manner as if she were sole."
So far as her separate property is concerned, a married woman thus becomes as absolute owner as though she were

OCTOBER TERM, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.
unmarried, and it would seem should also have the same protection, through her own evidence, as a feme sole. We do not think, therefore, that the exception of the defendants is well taken. With the testimony of Mrs. Stickney, "corroborated as it is in many particulars by statements of others and by the books of her husband and those of the executors of the estate of Amos Kendall, there can be no serious contention as to the correctness of the conclusions reached by the auditor as to matters of fact involved, upon the evidence presented to him.
This view of the admissibility of Mrs. Stickney's testimony disposes also of the supposed presumption, arising from her allowing her husband to use the moneys of her separate estate, that she intended them as a gift to him. Any presumption of that kind, if it would otherwise arise in the case, was entirely rebutted by her repeated and express directions to invest the moneys for her benefit in her own name. But we are of opinion that, in the absence of her testimony, there would be no presumption, since the passage of the farried Woman's Act, that she intended to give to her husband the moneys she placed in his hands, any more than a gift 'would be inferred from a third person who in like manner deposited money with him. If there be no proof of indebtedness to the party receiving the moneys, the. presumption would naturally be that they were placed with him to be held subject to the order of the other party, or to be invested for the latter's benefit. We think that whenever a husband acquires possession of the separate property of his wife, whether with or without her consent, he must be deemed to hold it in trust for her benefit, in the absence of any 'direct evidence that she intended to make a gift of it to him. In Grabill v. Moyer, 45 Penn. St. 530, 533, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, in speaking of the effect of an act of that State, passed on the 11th of April, 1848, confaining provisions similar to the Married Woman's Act of the District of Columbia, said: "When the act of assembly declares, as it does, that all property, real, personal and mixed, which shall accrue to any married woman during coverture, by will, descent, deed of conveyance, or

STICKNEY v. STICK IEY.
Opinion of the Court.
otherwise, shall be owned, used, and enjoyed by such married woman, as her own separate property; when the leading purpose of the act is to protect the wife's estate by excluding the husband, it is impossible for us to declare that the mere possession of it by the husband is proof that the title has passed from the wife to him. After it has been shown, as it was in this case, that the property accrued to the wife by descent from her father's and brother's estates, the presumption necessarily is that it continued hers. In such a case it lies upon one who asserts it to be the property of the husband to prove a transmission of the title, either by gift or contract for value, for the law does not transmit it without the act of the parties. If mere possession were sufficient evidence of a gift, the act of 1848 would be useless to the wife. Nothing is more easy than for the husband to obtain possession, even against the consent of the wife. And where he obtains it with her consent, it can be at most but slight evidence of a gift."
The case of Bergey's Ap2)eal, 60 Penn. St. 408, cited by the auditor in his report, is in point here. Bergey received money belonging to his wife, being her patrimonial portion, in her presence, and both united in a receipt for it. Not a word was spoken by the wife when her husband took up the money to count it, and put it in his pocket; nor was a word ever heard afterwards to the effect that the wife had made a gift of it. The husband appropriated it to the purchase of a farm, and the Supreme Court of the State held that no inference could arise of a gift from the transaction as detailed, observing that "she was not bound to attempt a rescue of it from him, or proclaim that it was not a gift. She might rest on the idea that his receipt, in her presence, was with the intent to take care of it for her. In Johnston,v. Johnston's A(rninistrator,31 Penn. St. 450, this court said, in a case of the nature of this, 'as the law made it (the money) hers, it presumes it to have been received for her by her husband.' That case contrasts the presumptions arising from the receipt of money by husbands, prior and subsequent to the act of 11th of April, 1848. In the first period, the presumption is that he has received it under and' by virtue of his marital

the notes when due, (if he did not elect to keep the notes,) to retake the cattle and sell them; but if there was no such agreement, and if the notes were given and accepted as absolute payment, without any reservation of a lien, that Babb, in order to enforce payment, would have no right to retake the cattle from the possession of the plaintiff or of his agent. And that there might be no confusion in the mind of the jury as to the right of Babb to resume possession of the cattle, they were instructed to find for the defendants, if they believed from the evidence that Carter, in whose possession they were when retaken, had authority from Crabtree to settle his debts and to sell and dispose of his cattle, and that he delivered them, under authority from Crabtree, in payment of the notes. In all this we do not perceive any error to the prejudice of the substantial rights of the defendants.
There are no other questions presented that we deem it necessary to notice, and the judgment must be

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE NORTHERNT DISTRICT OF GEORGIA.
flo. 208. Argued March 15, 18, 1889.-Decided May 13, 1889.
The judgments of Courts of Ordinary in Georgia in respect to subject matter within their jurisdiction are no more open to collateral attack than those of any other court.
The judgment of the Court of Ordinary allowing the resignation of one of two administrators upon proceedings had pursuant to statute, and discharging him after he had accounted to his co-administrator, and the latter had given a new bond, operated to exonerate the sureties upon the joint bond of both from liability for a devastavit committed after such order of discharge.
Cross-bills are necessary where certain defendants seek affirmative relief against their codefendants.
Where the Ordinary takes an administrator's bond in good faith, and it appears after liability has been incurred, that the names of some of the supposed sureties were signed thereto without authority, the mere fact

that the latter cannot be held, will not constitute a defence as to those who executed the bond without being misled or having relied upon the others being bound.
TME court, in its opinion, stated the case as follows:
James L. Rice and his wife, Ada S. Rice, citizens of the State of Tennessee, filed their bill of complaint, July 12th, 1881, in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Northern District of Georgia, against Frank P. Gray and his wife, Cora M., and also against said Gray as administrator of the estate of Lewis Tumlin, deceased, and also as guardian of the said Cora M., Napoleon B. Tumlin, George H.

Howard, A. W. Mitchell, Mary L. Spencer, Francis M. Ford, Noah King, Thomas W. Leake, Henry C. Ramsauer, administrator, and others, all citizens of the State of Georgia, alleging that on the 2d day of June, 1875, one Lewis Tumlin, of the county of Bartow, Georgia, died intestate, leaving as his heirs-at-law, his wife Mary L. Tumlin, now Mary L. Spencer; his sons, Napoleon B. Tumlin and George H. Tumlin; his daughters, the'said Ada S. Rice, formerly Ada S. Tumlin, .Lula T. Lyon, formerly Lula T. Tumlin, Cora M. Gray, formerly Cora M. Tumlin; and one Lewis T. Erwin, the son of a deceased daughter, who has sold and conveyed his interest in said estate to John S. Leake, each of whom upon his death was entitled to one seventh part of his estate, his wife having elected to take a child's part in lieu of dower; that the estate was of the aggregate value of about $300,000; that Frank P. Gray and Napoleon B. Tumlin obtained temporary letters of administration on said estate on the 11th day of June, 1875, giving bond in the sum of $200,000, with Abda Johnson, William T. Wofford, John W. Gray, James M. Veach and Edwin M,. Price as sureties; that on the second day of August, 1875, said Frank P. Gray and one John A.

Erwin had since that time removed from the State of Georgia to the State of Tennessee, and the said Thomas Tumlin had removed to Alabama; that Stakley had died intestate and no letters of administration had been granted on his estate until within less than twelve months before the filing of this bill; that said Abda Johnson died July 10, 1881, and his estate is now unrepresented, and for these reasons said Erwin, Tumlin, Stakley and Johnson are not made parties; that said Lewis R. lRamsauer died intestate, and Henry C. Ramsauer has qualified as his administrator, and as such is made a party, and "that the joint administration of said Frank P. Gray and John A. Erwin continued from the second day of August, 1875, until the second day of May, 1876, when the said John A. Erwin resigned, and his resignation was accepted by the Court of Ordinary of the county of Bartow." Complainants are informed and believe that Erwin resigned to avoid "the consequences of said Gray's waste and mismanagement," and thereupon "said Gray became sole administrator, against the consent and at the protest of all the heirs except Cora A. Gray and Mary L. Spencer, and gave bond as sole administrator in the sum of $140,000, with the said Abda Johnson, William T. Wofford, Edwin -M.Price, Noah King, William W. Rich, John W. Gray, Nelson Gilreath, James 0. Wofford, John S. Leake and Thomas W. Leake as sureties;" that on the 18th day of October, 1877, said William T. Wofford, James C. Wofford and William W. Rich applied to be relieved from their suretyship on the bond aforesaid on account of their want of confidence in the said Gray, and were so relieved, and said Gray gave a new bond as such administrator for the same sum, "with the said Abda Johnson, Nelson Gilreath, Noah King, John S. Leake, Thomas W. Leake,

Thomas Tumlin, John W. Gray, Absalom P. Wofford and Francis M. Ford as sureties ;" "that on the sixth day of May, 1878, said Noah King applied to be relieved on his bond last aforesaid, and was so relieved, and the said Frank P. Gray gave another bond as administrator in the sum of $140,000, with the said Abda Johnson, iNelson Gilreath, John W. Gray, Absalom P. Wofford, John S. Leake, Thomas W. Leake and Francis K. Ford as sureties;" and "that since that time said Gray has continued to act as administrator under the bond last aforesaid and is still in possession of the effects of said estate not heretofore disposed of."
Complainants show that Lewis Tumlin had made some advancements to some of his children, and on the second day of October, 1875, a distribution of property in kind was made, each of the heirs receiving $211,000, including the advancements; that since that time there has been no distribution, but some amounts have been received by some of the heirs; that Tumlin's estate was abundantly solvent and his liabilities should have been long since discharged and the estate wound up and the balance distributed, "which said Gray undertook and promised to do by his several bonds aforesaid," but he has not done it, and has refused to account or to pay over to complainants their distributive share; that Gray has been guilty of negligence, waste and fraud, which complainants proceed to charge in detail; and that said Lula T. Lyon heretofore filed her bill against said Gray as administrator, in the Superior Court of Bartow County, Georgia, seeking an account of her distributive share in said estate, and praying for an injunction to restrain said Gray from selling the real estate of said Tumlin, which he was, on or about the first day of January last, seeking to do, which injunction "had been granted by ihe judge of said court and had duly issued." After charging further acts 'of fraud and waste, the bill proceeds: "Complainants are un:able to state in many instances the date at which the waste of said estate was committed by said Gray, but they are informed and believe that most of, it occurred after the resignation of said Erwin, and after his ipresent bond was given, to wit, the one bearing date the 6th of May, 1878;" that Gray is insol-

vent; that A. P. Wofford, John W. Gray and Nelson Gilreath are insolvent; that Abda Johnson left considerable property, but his affairs are embarrassed; that John S. and Thomas W. Leake and Francis M. Ford are not worth exceeding $20,300; that large sums are due Tumlin's estate, which also owns several thousand dollars' worth of real estate; that many suits are pending in favor of the estate for the recovery of money and property, and also many suits against the estate, all of which should have been tried and disposed of long since; that the estate is solvent and Gray has ample means in his hands to pay off any recovery against it, but Gray has purposely delayed bringing the suits to trial in order to postpone the final settle'ment of the estate; that Gray has for several years been absent from Georgia, much of his time in Mississippi, and has declared his purpose to remove to that State; that on the 18th day of June, 1881, he filed in the office of the Ordinary of said county his resignation as administrator; that the heirs will be forced to suggest some other person as his successor, and whoever may be appointed the decision may be appealed from, and pending that, "a temporary administrator with limited powers would be the only representative of said estate;" and "that unless they can have the immediate aid of a court of equity by such suitable injunction and restraining order, and the early appointment of a receiver, the interests of said estate will suffer great and immediate loss, and complainants and the other heirs-at-law of Lewis Tumlin will be injured beyond remedy." They pray for answer but not upon oath, and for an injunction and an account, "and that complainants may have a decree for their distributive share in said estate against the said Frank P. Gray and his sureties on his administration bonds aforesaid, and that the respective liabilities of said several securities may be ascertained and fixed by said decree;" and for general relief.
Copies of the various bonds were filed as exhibits with the bill and also a copy of Gray's petition to resign as administrator, with citation to the heirs of Tumlin to ,appear before the Ordinary on the first Monday in July, 1881, to show cause why the resignation should not be allowed and James 0.

ford appointed administrator in Gray's stead, with return of service on several of the heirs and on Wofford. *
September 5th, 1881, defendants Napoleon B. Tumlin, George H. Tumlin, Mary L. Spencer, and Lula T. Lyon filed their answer, admitting the allegations of complainants' bill, and saying that they have a common interest with complainants in Tumlin's estate, and join in the charges and allegations of the bill against their codefendants, and unite in the prayers in said bill contained, and pray an account and for a decree against Gray and his securities.
October 3d, 1881, Gray and "his securities" answered, denying waste or maladministration by Gray; and on the same day, "the securities upon the alleged administration bond of John A. Erwin and Frank P. Gray" answered, denying any maladministration by Erwin and Gray, or either of them, during the period of their joint administration, and setting up Erwin's discharge, the giving of a new bond by Gray, and the settlement and accounting by Erwin. A demurrer for want of jurisdiction was also filed, and, having been argued, the circuit judge delivered an opinion assigning grounds for retaining the cause, the demurrer was overruled, a receiver appointed, and an injunction issued.
On the 20th of March, 1882, the case was referred to a special master to report upon the questions of law and fact raised by, or included in, the pleadings, and to state an account.
May 19th, 1883, complainants filed a petition stating that when the original bill was filed, they were informed and believed "the following state of facts to exist, to wit: That John A. Erwin had, in April, 1876, applied to the ordinary of Bartow County, Georgia, for leave to resign his office as a coadministrator on the estate of Lewis Tumlin, deceased; that orators in connection with N. B. Tumlin, G. H. Tumlin, Mary L. Spencer, and Lula T. Lyon had objected to said resignation, and upon the trial of their caveat to said application for leave to resign the ordinary had allowed said resignation, and all the other caveators heard had appealed from that decision, except orators, who gave the matter no further attention, and

VEACH v. RICE.
Statement of the Case.
were informed and believed that said resignation had been allowed, and they have all the time, until the filing of their bill, thought and believed that said Erwin had resigned his trust and his resignation had been allowed and accepted by the court;" that they believed said resignation could not release the sureties on the bond of Gray and Erwin, and since the reference of the case and during the hearing before the master defendants have put in evidence the record of said Erwin's resignation and the proceedings on appeal, from which it appears that Erwin's resignation has never been in fact or in law allowed; that "not being parties to said appeal, they had not given any attention to it, and did not know what had been done in it, except that the jury had found against the appeal, and they believed that all other legal steps had been taken to give effect to the verdict," which they now learn was not the case; and they ask to amend: "By an averment that Sohn A. Erwin, though not a party to said bill by reason of the fact that he resided without the jurisdiction of the court, is not only bound as the security of said Frank P. Gray in common with all the other sureties of said Gray and Erwin on the first administration bond, as claimed in the original bill, and is still in law one of the administrators of said estate, and has never legally resigned his trust as a co-administrator with Frank P. Gray on said estate, and that complainants are entitled to relief accordingly against them and all the sureties on all the administration bonds on said estate, and they pray relief accordingly." Leave to amend was granted on the same day, and the bill as amended referred to the special master.
On the 13th of September, 1883, the joint and several answer of H. 0. Erwin and J. G. B. Erwin, two of the defendants, was filed, by leave of court, averring that they never had become sureties on the bond of Erwin and Gray, because they had only authorized their names to be signed to the bond of Erwin.
On the 4th of October, 1883, Ramsauer, administrator, answered, stating that he is the administrator of L. R. Ramsaner, who signed a power of attorney authorizing respondent

to sign his name as one of the sureties to Erwin's bond, and he was also authorized by H. 0. Erwin and J. G. B. Erwin to sign such bond for them as attorney .infact, and that the power of attorney was changed by interlineation so as to authorize the signing of the bond of Erwin and Gray.
October 9th, 1883, the answer of James M. Veach, Robert L. Rogers, A. 0. Trimble, W. I. Benham, John J. Howard and A. W. Mitchell was filed, by leave, stating that they had signed the bond made jointly by John A. Erwin and F. P. Gray as the administrators of the estate of Lewis Tumlin; that John A. Erwin resigned his administratorship in May, 1876, and he, as well as his bondsmen, were discharged "by order of the Ordinary of Bartow County," and these respondents supposed that was the end of their connection with the administration of said estate. They insist that John A. Erwin is a necessary party to this bill as proposed to be amended; that they are informed that three of their co-sureties, namely, H. 0. and J. G. B. Erwin and L. R. Ramsauer, are seeking release on the ground that they only authorized their names to be signed to the bond of Erwin, and not of Erwin and Gray, and respondents say "that they were particular to make inquiry as to whether the Erwins and Ramsauer would go on said bond, and they agreed to sign said bond only upon condition that the others did." They set up Erwin's resignation upon notice to the heirs and distributees, and his discharge, which they insist discharged them from further liability; and say they know nothing of the alleged maladministration of Gray.
Replication was filed November 24, 1883. September 22, 1883, the special master filed his report stating the death of Tumlin, the names of his heirs-at-law, the election of the widow to take a child's part, the removal of Erwin to Tennessee, and of Thomas Tumlin to Alabama; the death of Stakley, of L. R. Ramsaifer, and of Abda Johnson, the appointment of Gray and Tumlin as temporary administrators and of Gray and Erwin as permanent administrators, on the second day of August, 1875, and the giving of bond by them, in the usual form, in the penal sum of $600,000, which

"bond was joint and several and payable to the Ordinary of Bartow County, Georgia, for the time being, and his successors in office." The report sets forth the return of the inventory, which alleged that "there were some wild lands and evidences of debt left out to be appraised as soon as they could be definitely ascertained;" the sale of personal property; the award of support for widow and minor; the appointment of commissioners to divide land and their return; the application by the administrators for a commission of 3 per cent on $141,456, as compensation foi'services in and about the division of the real estate; the allowance of the 3 per cent; the first annual return of Gray and Erwin and its approval; the application of Erwin for discharge; the order requiring the distributees to show cause; the order of discharge; the giving by Gray of a new bond; the final receipt of Gray~to Erwin and the final discharge; and the appeal from the decision of the Ordinary permitting Erwin to resign and Gray to become sole administrator, to the Superior Court of Bartow County, where it was affirmed by verdict, August 4, 1876. The report says there is no record evidence that a judgment was entered upon said verdict. It further states that on Xune 16, 1876, Gray gave bond to Erwin reciting that :Erwin transfers to Gray all commission and compensation which might be allowed Erwin for his services as administrator, and in consideration thereof Gray bound himself to pay any judgment against Erwin for any waste or loss occasioned by any act or failure of duty in any way by Erwin as administrator; sundry sales by Gray returned to the Ordinary; the discharge of W. T. Wofford, Rich, and James C. Wofford, sureties on Gray's administration bond; the new bond given by Gray, October 13, 1877; the new bond given by Gray, May 6, 1878 ; the second return by Gray, administrator, August 6, 1877, further time having been granted to him to make it; the return of 1878, in accordance with time given to make it; the return for 1879, 1880, and 1881; and the appointment of the receiver in this case, November 14, 1881. Various charges for commissions on interest are considered, and the subject of the inventory of wild lands, the failure to make and perfect return thereof being held to be

excusable and not to have damaged the estate. The master holds there was a valid resignation and discharge of Erwin from the office of administrator, dating from June 12, 1876, but that the sureties on the bond of Gray and Erwin were not discharged. He disallows the 3 per cent commissions on division of land, amounting to $3433.68, as excessive, and reduces it to five hundred dollars, which was subsequently disallowed by the court. He considers the state of the accounts elaborately, and holds the sureties on Gray and Erwin's bond liable '" for the waste or default of the joint dministration of Gray and Erwin, and since of the sole administration of Gray;" and he refers to the claim, September 20, 1883, of two of the sureties on the bond of Gray and Erwin, to wit, Henry 0. and J. G. B. Erwin, that they never signed nor authorized any one to sign their names to a joint bond of Gray and Erwin, but he refused to hear evidence because the issue was not involved in the pleadings as they then stood. To this re-. port defendants V¥ach, :Rogers, Trimble, Benham, Howard, Mitchell, H. 0., and J. G. B. Erwin, and iRamsauer filed their exceptions, and they subsequently petitioned the court to be allowed to file amended answers, which was allowed, and which amendments have heretofore been given.
November 26, 1883, the report was recommitted with directions, and sundry other reports made, and among them one, October 4, 1884, that H. C. Erwin, J. G. B. Erwin, and H. 0. Ramsauer were not bound as sureties on the Gray and Erwin bond because they had not authorized their names to be signed to it, and holding that Benham, Rogers, Trimble, Mitchell, Veach and Howard were not thereby discharged. The master also reported that a judgment in the Bartow Superior Court had been entered February 16, 1884, nunc ro tunc, as of the July term, 1876, upon the verdict upon appeal from the discharge of Erwin by the Ordinary, but that his opinion remained unchanged that the release or discharge of Erwin as co-administrator with Gray did -not discharge the sureties on said joint bond. The complainants excepted to the report of the master in favor of H, C. and J. G. B. Erwin, and Ramsaner. Defendants Veacli, Howard, Trimble, Rogers, Benham

and Mitchell excepted to the master's report in discharging the two Erwins and Ramsauer and not discharging them, as well as to the forfeiture of certain commissions reported by him.
December 13, 1884, the defendant Cora Al. Gray filed a supplemental answer, praying for a decree as a distributee, as did defendant John S. Leake, January 21, 1885.
Among the proofs in the case accompanying the master's reports were the petition of John A. Erwin for permission to resign his office of administrator, and the proceedings thereon. This petition was dated April 11, 1876, and set forth the issuing of letters of administration to Gray and Erwin; that Tumlin left as his heirs-at-law and distributees of his estate his widow, Mrs. Mary L. Tumlin, Napoleon Tumlin, Mrs. Lula T. Lyon, Mrs. Cora Gray, George Henry Tumlin, a minor, and Lewis T. Erwin; that Mrs. Gray is a minor, and Frank P. Gray her guardian; that Erwin is guardian of George Henry Tumlin and Lewis T. Erwin; that Mrs. Ada S. Rice, of Tennessee, is also one of the heirs-at-law of said Lewis Tumlin, and a distributee of his estate; that "your petitioner is in bad health, and from his physical infirmity is unable to give that attention to the management of said estate that he otherwise would, and that he ought to give as administrator; that most of the real estate belonging to said estate and a gTeat portion of the personalty has been divided and delivered to the distributees of said estate; that Frank P. Gray, the co-administrator of your petitioner, is willing to give new bond and carry on said administration of said estate alone. Your petitioner, therefore, prays that he be permitted to resign his office as administrator on the estate of said Lewis Tumlin, upon a full and complete compliance with the law in such case made and provided, and your petitioner prays that each of said heirs-atlaw of -said Lewis Tumlin hereinbefore named may be cited by your honor to be and appear before your honor on the first Monday in May next, then and there to show cause, if any they have, why your petitioner should not resign his office of administrator as aforesaid, on his complying with the law in such case made and provided."

Statement of the Case.
On the 12th of April, 1876, citation in due form was issued upon said petition by the Ordinary to the heirs-at-law and distributees of the estate of Lewis Tumlin, deceased, and to the guardians of the minor heirs named in said petition, and it was "further ordered that each of said heirs-at-law who are of full age, and the guardians of the minor heirs, be served with a copy of the foregoing petition and this citation (unless they should acknowledge service) ten days before the time appointed for hearing said petition and passing on same." Service was acknowledged of the petition and citation and further service waived, April 13, 1876, by John A. Erwin as guardian for G. H. Tumlin and as guardian for L. T. Erwin, and by Frank P. Gray as administrator and as guardian for Cora Gray; service of petition and citation was also acknowledged by Mary L. Tumlin and N. Tumlin, April 17, 1876, and the petition and citation was served on Mrs. Lula T. Lyon, April 20, 1876; affidavit was also made that on the 7th [17th] day of April, 1876, a copy of the petition of Erwin and a copy of the citation signed by the Ordinary were handed to Mrs. Ada S. Rice in person, and that at the same time Mrs. Ada S. Rice wrote the following on the original, to wit: "I acknowledge service of the within petition this April 17, 1876."
On the 1st of May, 1876, Gray filed before the Ordinary a written expression of his willingness for Erwin to resign, Gray retaining the sole administration in his own name, and proposing to file "such bond in furtherance of the same as the Ordinary may deem proper in the premises."
May 1, 1876, the Ordinary entered the following order in open court:

Lewis Tumlin, late of Bartow County, deceased, for leave to resign his said office of administrator, and all the heirs-at-law of Lewis Tumlin having been duly served with citation to show cause why John A. Erwin should not be allowed to resign the office of administrator on the estate of Lewis Tumlin, deceased, and all of said heirs being represented now before the court, and no sufficient cause being shown why said Erwin should not be allowed to resign his trust, as administrator as aforesaid, and it appearing to the court that the bodily health, physical infirmities, and the health of his wife are such that he is unable to give his attention to the management of the business of said estate, and Frank P. Gray being cited to appear before the court, and having been served with said citation, and now coming before the court and expressing a willingness to accept the office of administrator of the estate of Lewis Tumlin, deceased, and it appearing to the court that the allowing of said Erwin to resign his office of administrator will not injure the interest of said estate in any way: Therefore, ordered and adjudged by the court, that the resignation of the said John A. Erwin of the office of administrator on the estate of Lewis Tumlin, deceased, be, and the. same is hereby, allowed, and it is hereby further ordered and adjudged by the court that Frank P.

On the same day the petition of Gray and Erwin was filed, showing that they had distributed in kind real estate among the heirs-at-law of the deceased amounting to $114,456, specifying the parcels and amounts, and setting up that "the responsibility and the trouble in effecting the transfer has been considerable. Your petitioners allege that they have received no compensation at all for this service thus rendered said estate, and pray your honor to pass an order allowing them 3 per cent on said sum of $114,456 as commission on the same;" whereupon the court entered an order allowing the administrators ."for extra compensation for delivering and dividing to the heirs-at-law the real estate in kind belonging to said deceased," 3 per cent on the above sum.
On the 6th of May a list and schedule of all the property which had come to the possession of Gray and Erwin as administrators, and which remained unadministered and in their possession May 6, 1876, not embracing the wild lands, which "have not yet been fully located," was filed, and a receipt from Gray to Erwin for all of said property, which was acknowledged before the Ordinary and filed in his office M ay 22, 1876. On the 2d of May, Gray g-a.ve a new bond, as required by the order of May 1, reciting the resignation of Erwin and its allowance, and the order for the new bond, the condition being: "Now, if the above bound Frank P. Gray shall well and truly administer the goods and chattels, rights and credits, lands and.tenements of the said Lewis Tumlin, deceased, which .remain to be administered, and which have come to the hands, possession or knowledge of the said Frank P. Gray, or in the hands or possession of any other person or persons for him," etc., etc., in the usual form; which bond was duly attested and approved by the Ordinary, and "filed in office May 2d, 1876."
Oif the 12th of June, 1876, the following order was entered in open court by the Ordinary:

Court of Ordinary, Bartow County. Adjourned Term. June 12, 1876.
John A. Erwin, Adm'r est. Lewis Tumlin, dec'd.
Upon considering the above application of John A. Erwin, one of the joint administrators of the estate of Lewis Tumlin, late of Bartow County, deceased, for a discharge, and the said John A. Erwin, as administrator, having by order of this court been permitted to resign said trust, and which resignation has been accepted by the court, and Frank P. Gray, his co-administrator, having consented to accept the entire administration of said estate, and having given new bond and security, as ordered by the court, and the said John A. Erwin having filed a return showing the property that has been administered belonging to said estate, and having filed the said Frank P. Gray's receipt for all the unadministered property belonging to said estate, and being satisfied that said return and receipt contain all the property administered and not administered belonging to said estate which has come into the hands of John A. Erwin, as administrator, it is therefore ordered that said John A. Erwin be, and he is hereby, fully discharged from the office of administrator on the estate of Lewis Tumlin, deceased, and that letters of dismission do issue to him.
Granted in open court June adj'd term, 1876. J. A. HowARD, Ordinanj.
From this order mrs. Mary L. Tumlin, Mrs. Lula T. Lyon and Napoleon Tumlin appealed to the Superior Court of Bartow County, where the appeal was dismissed as to Mrs. Mary L. Tumlin at her request, and upon trial the jury returned the following verdict, August 4, 1876: "That the jury find in favor of John A. Erwin, and that his resignation be allowed."
An order appears of record in the Superior Court, headed as follows:
"Appeal to the Superior Court of Bartow Co., Ga., from the order in the Ordinary's court of said county permitting John A. Erwin to resign and F. P. Gray to become sole adm'r of said estate, and required to give new bond, and Gray to become sole adm'r of said estate, and refusing to allow Theodore

Smith to be co-adm'r of said estate. Appeal from the above decision of the Ordinary made May 1st, 1876, and carried to the Superior Court of said Co., by whom the decision of said Ordinary was affirmed at the July term, 1876."
This order granted thirty days to the appellants to perfect their motion for a new trial and agree upofh the evidence, the motion to be heard in vacation, so that if the motion for a new trial be refused the appellants can take the case to the Supreme Court of Georgia at the next January term. Nothing further appears to have been done in the premises, but at the January term, 1884, of the Bartow Superior Court, due notice having been given to the heirs and distributees and to the receiver in this case, the Superior Court entered judgment nuncpro tuen upon the verdict rendered in 1876, affirming the allowance of Erwin's resignation.
On the 22d day 9f January, 1885, a final decree was rendered, by which, after overruling the various exceptions to the reports of the special master, it was among other things adjudged and decreed that Gray was liable on his several administration bonds for the sum of 8-7,122.44, the sureties on the bond of Erwin and Gray being held liable for the whole amount, and the sureties on the other bonds for different parts of said gross sum, and from that decree appeal was prosecuted to this court by James 11.

shall be deemed sufficient, and no administrator's bond shall be declared invalid by reason of any variation therefrom, as to payee, amount, or condition, where the manifest intention was. to give bond as administrator, and a breach of his duty as such has been proved.

Any administrator who, from age or infirmity, removal from the county, or for any other cause, desires to resign his trust, may petition the Ordinary, stating the reasons, and the name of a suitable person qualified and entitled to and willing to accept the trust; whereupon the Ordinary shall cite such person, and the next of kin of the intestate, to appear and show cause why the order should not be granted. If no good cause be shown, and the Ordinary is satisfied that the interest of the estate will not suffer, the resignation shall be, allowed, and the administrator shall be discharged from his trust whenever he has fairly settled his accounts with his successor and filed with the Ordinary the receipt in full of such successor. I'Jinors in interest shall be allowed five years from the time of their arrival at majority to examine into and open such settlement.

Mr. TV. K I6ore, for appellees, contended as follows as to the points passed upon by the court in its opinion:

VEACH v. RICE.
Argument for Appellees.
I. The minors were not parties to the proceedings upon Erwin's resignation, and not being parties, it was not effectual as against them. John A. Erwin, in seeking to resign his trust, and F. P. Gray, who wanted the sole administration, both had interest adverse to the three minor heirs. In such case the acknowledgment of service of John A. Erwin, as guardian for the minors, G. H. Tumlin and L. T. Erwin, was insufficient and ineffectual, as well as the acknowledgment of F. P. Gray, as guardian of Cora Gray, minor. This is the only service shown in the record and is the only service directed to be made in the citation itself. Code of Georgia, § 1821; Act of February 25, 1876, Session Acts of Georgia of 1876, 103.
IL Erwin's resignation, if valid, did not -accomplish his release as security, nor the release of the appellants who were sureties on the joint and several bond of Frank P. Gray and John A. Erwin. Sdction 2510 of the Code of Georgia, which was the law at that time, provides that if two or more administrators unite in a common bond, all the sureties are bound for the acts of each administrator, and the administrators themselves are mutual sureties for each other's conduct. This provision of law is part of the bond, and should be read as if inserted in it. lFon Ilofman v. Quincy, 4 Wall. 535, 550.
The act of February 10, 1854, incorporated into the Code of Georgia as § 2610, first made provision for the resignation of an executor. It seems to contemplate the resignation of a
sole administrator, but is doubtless broad enough, under §
4 of the Code, paragraph 4, to include one of two or more joint administrators. That paragraph reads: "The singular or plural number shall each include the other, unless expressly excluded." Nevertheless it has no application to that case, because the whole trust remained in the survivor by operation of law. The common law is in force in Georgia, (Cobb's Digest, 721,) and by it the power of an executor survives on the death of his co-executor. And so, if administration is granted to two, and one dies, the other becomes sole administrator, and all the power of the office survives to him. 2 Williams on

Executors, citing Jocorab v. Riarwood, 2 Yes. Sen. 267, 268; Flanders v. Clark, 1 Yes. Sen.; see also, Hudson v. Hudson, 1 Atk. 460, S. C., cas. temp. Talb. 127; 2d Com. Dig. B. 7; Bac. Abr. 56, tit. Executors (G.). In case of death the entire interest vests in the survivor.
The Ordinary could not make a new appointment to the office of administrator while it was not vacant. Griffith v. Frazier,8 Cranch, 9; Kane v. Paul,14 Pet. 33; Braxton v. State, 25 Indiana, 82; Pritchardv. State, 34 Indiana, 137; Brandt on Suretyship and Guarantee, § 498, and cases cited; Clarke v. State, 6 G. & J. 288; S. C. 26 Am. Dec. 576; .irby v. Turner, Hopk. Ch. 309; Green v. Hanerry, 2 Brock. 403. And in fact he did not attempt to exercise such a power. The order granted at May term declares that the resignation of Erwin be allowed, and that Frank ?. Gray, the co-administrator of said John A. Erwin, be, and he is hereby, declared and appointed the sole administratdr of the estate, and required to give new bond, etc. The Ordinary by this order declared just what the law declared in such cases. If he had regarded the office vacant and the appointment a new one it would have been his duty to administer to him the oath provided for every administrator in § 2504 of the Code, and it would also have been his duty to appoint and grant to him letters of administration de bonis non under § 2490 of Code. "Administration de bonis non is granted upon an estate already partially administered and from any cause unrepresented."
As to the discharge of the sureties, we admit that, as there was a law in force in Georgia at the date thereof authorizing the discharge of sureties, these sureties could have been discharged in the manner pointed out by that law without impairing the obligation of this contract, and that is so because such law then existing became part of the contract, as hereinbefore contended. We maintain, however, that the terms and"conditions of that law must be strictly complied with; it is not only law but also contract.

ions are found in the Code, § 181'(. This section of the Code has been so fully construed and passed upon by the Supreme Court of Georgia that I refer to their decision to show that there was not and could not be any valid discharge of the sureties in this case. See Dupont v. .Mayo, 56 Georgia, 304.
III. The second report of the special master was in error in holding that the discharge of J. G. B. Erwin, H. C. Erwin and L. S. Ramsadfer because their names had been improperly signed to the joint bond of Gray and Erwin, administrators, by their attorney-in-fact, did not discharge all the sureties. Lewis v. Gordon County, 70 Georgia, 486; .fathis v. Morgan, 72 Georgia, 517; Dair v. United States, 16 Wall. 1; State v. Lewis, 73 North Carolina, 138; Cutler v. Roberts, 7 Nebraska, 4; Yash v. Tugate, 32 Grattan, 595; Trustees of Schools v. Sheik, 119 Illinois, 579; Carroll County v. Ruggles, 69 Iowa, 269.
M. CHIEF JusTicn FuLLER, after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the court.
By the order of the Ordinary of May 1, 1876, the resignation of John A. Erwin as administrator of the estate of Lewis Tumlin, deceased, was allowed, and Frank P. Gray was appointed sole administrator and required to give a new bond and security, which being given, and Erwin having settled and accounted with Gray, his successor in administration, and filed his receipt as provided by law, it was ordered that John A. Erwin as administrator and his securities be discharged from "any and all liability for any mismanagement of said estate in the future, but not from any past liability;" and this sdttlement having been made and receipt filed and new bond given by Gray, and these successive acts approved, by order of June 12, 1876, the discharge of Erwin as administrator was made absolute.
From the judgment of the Ordinary an appeal was prosecuted to the Superior Court of Bartow County by three of the heirs, one of whom dismissed her appeal, and, upon trial had, the decision of the Court of Ordinary was affirmed by

OCTOBER TERMN, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.
the verdict of a jury, and time taken to perfect a bill of exceptions with the view of carrying the case to the Supreme Court, which was not done. Judgment appears not to have been entered upon the verdict until pending this cause, when it was so entered nuncyro'tunc as of July term, 1876. The Superior Court thus deterinined the order of the Ordinary to have been a proper one, and passed upon the question of jurisdiction.
Mrs. Ada S. Rice was duly served with Erwin's petition to be discharged, and citation to appear, but acquiesced in said orders, and did not participate in the appeal therefrom, and paid no further attention thereto, as she says in her petition to amend of May 19, 1883. Something over five years afterwards she filed the bill in this case, and by amendment, some two years after that, sought to hold the sureties on the bond of Erwin and Gray for alleged maladministration of the latter after the discharge of the former.
The Courts of Ordinary in Georgia are courts of original, exclusive and general jurisdiction over decedents' estates and the subject matter of these orders, and its judgments are no more open to collateral attack than the judgments, decrees or orders of any other court. .Davie v. McDaniel, 47 Georgia, 195; Barnes v., Underwood, 5-1 Georgia, 87; Patterson v. Lemon,50 Georgia, 231, 236; Caujollev. .Ferrig,13 Wall. 465.
In Jacobs v. .Pou,18 Georgia, 346, it was held that "the judgment of dismissal, by the Court of Ordinary, in such cases, must operate as a discharge from all liability on the part of the administrator, unless the same be impeached in that court, for irregularity, or in the Superior Court, for fraud;" and in Bryan v. 11altor, 14 Georgia, 185, that the order appointing an administrator, and in Davie v. McDaniel, 47 Georgia, 195, and .AecDade v. Burch, 7 Georgia, 559, that an order for sale of lands, could not be collaterally attacked.
It is argued, however, that upon Erwin s resignation the whole trust remained in Gray as survivor, and that the Ordinary could not make a new appointment while the office was not vacant, and § 2514 of the code is referred to, providing that, upon the revocation of the letters of one administrator, the trust remains in the hands of the other. The well-known

VEACH v. RICE.
Opinion of the Court.
case of Gifth v. Frazier,8 Cranch, 9, isalso cited as in point, where letters of administration were held invalid, there being a qualified executor capable of exercising the authority with which he had been invested by the testator. But we think the position taken is untenable. Under the code, upon the death of an administrator, where there are more than one, the right of administration survives, (§ 2499,) but the Ordinary may apparently grant letters to others, (§ 2500 ;) and upon the revocation of the letters of one administrator, where there are more than one, the trust remains in the hands of the other, "and with him, as to an administrator de bonis non, the removed administrator must account," (§ 2514,) and his sureties are "liable for his acts in connection with his trust up to the time of his settlement with an administrator de onis non or the distributees of the estate" (§ 2512). When an administrator resigns, and the resignation is allowed, he "shall be discharged from his trust whenever he has fairly settled his accounts with his successor and filed with the Ordinary the receipt in full of such successor" (§ 2610). This section uses the singular number, but undoubtedly covers the case of more than one administrator. Paragraph 4 of § 4 of the code reads: "The singular or plural number shall each include the other, unless expressly excluded." Code, 1882, p. 3.
Every administrator after the first is an administrator de bonis non,in fact, and it is not important it should so appear of record. Steen v. Bennett, 24 Vermont, 303; Grande v. Herrerra,15 Texas, 533 ; -Moseley's Administratorsv. Miiartin, 37 Alabama, 219; Ex parte -Maxwell, 37 Alabama, 362.
The Ordinary in accepting the resignation of Erwin treated the case as he would have done if Erwin's letters had been revoked by removal, and entered the orders in respect to Gray, as successor of Erwin and Gray, and so administrator de bonis non, and the new bond was accordingly conditioned to secure the administration of the property which remained to be administered. It is said by counsel that prior to 1854 there was no provision in the laws of Georgia for the resignation of an administrator, but it would seem that if an administrator had resigned, and his resignation had been accepted, such action

OCTOBER TERM, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.
on the part of the Ordinary would have been held equivalent to a revocation of his letters in the exercise of the power of removal. lfarsh v. The People, 15 Illinois, 284.
As already stated, under the provisions of the Georgia code, where there are more than one administrator, and the letters of one are revoked, he must account to his co-administrator "as to an administratorde honis non," and as, in the instance of the resignation of a sole administrator he must account to his suc-" cessor, so where there are more than one, he who resigns inust account to his co-administrator, as such successor, who would in effect in such case be an administrator de bonis non.
Irrespectively of statutory regulation, an administrator de bonis non could only administer upon the assets remaining unadministered, in specie; but under these provisions the retiring administrator must account to his successor, and such accounting is required before discharge.
It is urged that, as Erwin applied only for his own discharge as administrator and not as surety for Gray, and as the sureties made no application in their own behalf, the effect of Erwin's discharge was not to release the sureties. By § 2509 of the code, the provisions where a surety on a guardian's bonds desires to be relieved as surety are made applicable to sureties on administrators' bonds; and by § 1817 a mode is provided for obtaining such relief on complaint made by the surety to the Ordinary, citation to the guardian, hearing, and order of discharge. And in Dupont v. .Mayo, 56 Georgia, 304, 306, it was held that where there was no petition, citation, or hearing, an order accepting a new bond already executed by the guardian and declaring a former surety discharged, could not be sustained. But those sections apply to a different state of case, namely, where the sureties are asking to be relieved from liability, and not where the administrator himself is requesting leave to retire.
Erwin proceeded in conformity with the, statute in such case made and provided, and, under the orders of May 1 and June 12, 1876, ceased to be administrator, and was discharged from further liability as such, as were the sureties who had signed the bond of Erwin and Gray.

VEACH v. RICE.
Opinion of the Court.
In Justices, etc. v. Selman, 6 Georgia, 432, the second section of an act of 1S12 came under consideration, which read as follows: "Any executor, executrix, administrator, administratrix, or guardian, whose residence may be changed from one county to another, either by the creation of a new county, removal ov otherwise, shall have the privilege of making the annual returns required of them by this act, to the Court of Ordinary of the county in which they reside, by having previously obtained a copy of all the records concerning the estates for which they are bound as executors, executrix, administrators, administratrix, or guardian, and having had the same recorded in the proper office in the county in which they then reside, and having given new bond and security, as the law directs, for the performance of their duty."
The court held, Lumpkin, J. delivering the opinion, "that the mere taking of a new bond does not, necessarily, release the old sureties, and especially when the new bond is taken by authority of law, for the purpose of strengthening the existing security," but that when the second or subsequent bond is given for a new and different undertaking, it operates, ipsofacto, as a discharge of the prior parties and hence that when the provisions of the act are fully complied with the sureties on the first bond are discharged from all further liabilitv on account of their principal.
We are of opinion that the court erred in rendering a decree against the sureties on the joint bond of Erwin and Gray fori a devastavit committed after June 12, 1876.
Counsel for appellees contend that the sureties on this bond were not discharged because the service of the petition aild citation on the three minor heirs, on Erwin's petition to resign, was insufficient, and guardians ad literm should have been appointed; that the resignation, was not effectual as to them, and therefore not as to any of the others. This point was not passed upon by the special master or the Circuit Court, nor was a cross-bill filed on behalf of either of these defendants. They asked no relief as against complainants but affirmative relief against their co-defendants, these sureties, and under such circumstances cross-bills are necessary.

OCTOBER TERM, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.
If, however, cross-bills were filed, as all the defendants are citizens of Georgia, and the complainants are citizens of Tennessee it is questionable whether the relief which the complainants could not obtain on their own case could be properly awarded by the Circuit Court, even though it could be successfully contended that these particular defendants were entitled to relief upon the ground suggested, and that their co-distributees could avail themselves of. such conclusion, in respect to which we express no opinion, as these questions are not before us for decision in the present condition of the record.
It is assigned as error that the court decreed in accordance with the special master's report that the discharge of T. G. B. Erwin, H. 0. Erwin and L R. Ramsauer, because their names had been improperly signed to the joint bond of Erwin and Gray, did not discharige their co-sureties; but this was not urged on the argument. The master proceeded upon the ground that it was appellants' duty to see for themselves that the signatures of their co-sureties were binding upon them, if they intended to rely upon their being bound; and that it was the Ordinary's duty to see that valid signatures were made to the bond, but not to protect any one as surety, and that no fraud, concealment, or want of good faith could be charged on the Ordinary.
We do not regard the overruling of the exception, based as it is on the assumption of knowledge on the part of the Ordinary, and concealment misleading the other sureties, as erroneous. Dair v. United States, 16 Wall. 1 ; Lewis v. Board of Commissioners, 70 Georgia, 486; iifatthis v. .9lorgan, '72 Georgia, 517; Trustees v. Sheik, 119 Illinois, 579.
It is further objected by appellants that the court erred in disallowing any commissions to Erwin and Gray, and particularly, the commissions of $3433.68 for distribution in kind.
Upon a careful consideration of the proofs in the printed record and the various reports of the special master bearing upon this subject, we do not find such evidence of mismanagenient on the part of Erwin and Gray as requires the forfeiture of all commissions, and, without entering upon any discussion of the details, we approve of the conclusions reached by the

ROBINSON v. FAIR.
Syllabus.
ROBINSON v. FAIR.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA.
No. 18. Argued April 9, 10, 1888.--Decided October 22, 1M5.
The State Constitution in force in California prior to 1880 authorized the legislature to confer upon Probate Courts jurisdiction of proceedings for the partition of real estate, as ancillary or supplementary to the settlement and distribution of the estates of deceased persons coming within the cognizance of such courts.
The legislature of California, under the Constitution in force prior to 1880, conferred upon the Probate Courts of the State power, after final settlement of the accounts of a personal representative, and after a decree of distribution, defining the undivided interests of heirs in real estate in the hands of such representative, (neither the title of the decedent nor the fact of heirship being disputed,) to make partition of such estate among the heirs, so as to invest each separately with the exclusive possession and ownership of distinct parcels of such realty, as against coheirs; and such a grant of power does not appear to be foreign to the jurisdiction usually pertaining to such tribunals in this country.
The decisions of the Supreme Court of California examined and shown to be in harmony with the two points above stated.
The difference between distribution and partition of real estate among heirs pointed out.
A Circuit Court of the United States has no jurisdiction to set aside a decree of partition in a state Probate Court authorized by law to make it; nor can it refuse to give full effect to the decree unless the Probate Court was without jurisdiction in the case.
The jurisdiction of a Probate Court to make partition of real estate of a decedent among his heirs is not defeated by the fact that the proceedings for it were originated by a petition of the administratrix, who was also an heir at law, asking for a settlement of her accounts as administratrix, and for the adjudication of her rights as heir at law, by partition of the real estate; the record showing that the court made the decree for the final settlement and distribution of the estate before it entered upon the question of partition.
The record in this case does not support the contention that proper notice of the proceedings in the Probate Court for the partition of the real estate was not given to the minor children.
At the time when the proceedings took place, which form the subject of controversy in this suit, there being no provision of law in force in California, requiring the appointment of guardians ad litem of infants, in probate proceedings, it was sufficient for them to be represented in such proceedings by an attorney, appointed by the court for that purpose.

OCTOBER TERMI, 1888.
Statement of the Case.
Tins case involved the title to a fifty-vara lot in the city of San Francisco, numbered two hundred and five on its official map. It was a part of the separate estate of Horace Hawes, senior, who died, intestate, in that city, on March 12, 1871, leaving as his only heirs at law, his widow Caroline Hawes, and two minor children; Horace Hawes, junior, born March 22, 1859, and Caroline C. Hawes, born August 26, 1864. In December, 1871, the widow qualified as administratrix in the Probate Court of the city and county of San Francisco. In that capacity she took possession, as was her duty under the law of California, of the entire estate of her deceased husband, and held it subject to the control of that court. Civil Code,
§ 1384; Code of Civil Procedure, § 1581.
In addition to the above lot, the intestate was the owner, at the time of his death, of a large amount of property, principally real estate, in the counties of San Francisco and San Mateo, some of which was community property, and the residue separate property. By the law of California, upon the death of the husband, intestate, one-half of the community property goes to the surviving wife, and the other to his descendants equally, or, in the absence of descendants, according to the right of representation, and in the same manner as the separate property of the husband; and upon the death of the husband, leaving a widow and more than one child living, or the lawful issue of one or more deceased children, one-third of his estate, not otherwise limited by marriage contract, goes to the widow, and the remainder in equal shares to his children and to the lawful issue of any deceased child by right of rep-
resentation. Civil Code, §§ 163, 164, 687, 1386, 1402.
The estate was divided by proceedings commenced, February 18, 1875, by Mrs. Hawes, administratrix, in the Probate Court of the city and county of San Francisco. They were instituted for the purpose of obtaining a final settlement of her accounts, and, also, the distribution and the partition of the estate. Such a settlement was had, and, after a decree of distribution was passed, the court proceeded to make partition between the heirs, according to their respective interests, of the various parcels of real estate remaining in the hands of the

ROBINSON v. FAIR.
Statement of the Case.
administratrx. By the final decree of partition, rendered April 19, 1875, certain property, including the above lot, was set apart to the widow, while other lands in that county, and in San Mateo County, were allotted to the children.
By deed of May 24, 1875, and for the consideration of three hundred thousand dollars, the widow conveyed the above lot to James C. Flood. The latter was in possession under his purchase until August 21, 1876, when he sold and conveyed, for a like sum, to James G. Fair, who, prior to the present litigation, put upon the lot substantial improvements of the value of several hundred thousand dollars.
On the 6th of April, 1881, Caroline C. Hawes intermarried with James A. Robinson, who had previously, February 24, 1881, qualified as her guardian.
The present suit was brought, June 6, 1882, in the names of Mrs. Robinson, (by her husband as guardian,) and Horace Hawes, Junior, to recover two undivided thirds of said fiftyvara lot. In the progress of the cause Mrs. Robinson was joined with her brother as an original plaintiff in her own right. The defendant claimed title under the decree of partition in the Probate Court. That decree, the plaintiffs insisted, was void. A jury having been waived, there was judgment for the defendant, the court below holding that the proceedings in the Probate Court were in conformity, in all respects, with law.
The foregoing statement forms part of the opinion of the court in this case. The court below gave no opinion. In addition to that statement the justice who delivered the opinion in this court has kindly furnished the following summary of other facts forming essential parts of the case:
On the 18th of February, 1875, the real estate of the decedent, remaining in the hands of the administratrix, consisted of what is known as Mission Block No. 44, the southeasterly part of Mission Block No. 8, Mission Block No. 2, and the fifty-vara lot No. 205, in San Francisco; also, the Redwood farm and certain villa lots in San Iateo County. The two parcels first named were acquired in 1860, after the marriage of Mrs. Hawes with the intestate, and were, therefore, "con-

Statement of the Case.
mon" property. The other parcels were the separate property of the decedent. All those parcels were in the hands of the administratrix, because, by the law of California, a personal representative, whether executor or administrator, is required to take possession of all the estate, real and personal, of the decedent; and his possession for the purpose, among other things, of partition, is that of the heirs or devisees, although their possession is subject to his for purposes of administration. Code of Civil Procedure, § 1581.
On the day last named, Caroline Hawes instituted proceedings in the Probate Court, of the city and county of San Francisco, to obtain a final settlement of her accounts, and to have a distribution and partition of the estate remaining in her hands, as administratrix, between herself and the minor children, according to their respective rights, and pursuant to the statute in sich cases made and provided. To that end she prayed that an order be made "directing that all persons interested in this estate appear before this court at a time and place to be specified, not less than four, or more than ten weeks from the time of making said order, to show cause why an order should not be granted directing that partition be made in said estate, and that distribution be made of the estate of Horace Hawes, deceased; and that partition be made of the real estate thereof, among the persons entitled thereto; or if the same cannot otherwise be fairly divided, that the same be sold and the proceeds distributed among those entitled; or that such other or further or different order may be made as will be just and proper in the premises."
Upon that petition an order was made that all persons interested in the estate appear before the court on the 23d of September, 1875, to show cause why the final account filed by the administratrix should not be settled, allowed, and approved. That order also declares:
"And whdreas said account is for final settlement, and it duly appearing that said estate is ready for distribution, and that, upon confirmation of said final account, distribution and partition of all said estate to all persons entitled thereto has been duly demanded:

ROBINSON v. FAIR.
Statement of the Case.
"It is further ordered, that all persons interested in said es-
tate, be and appear before said court, at the time and place aforesaid, without further notice or proceeding therefor, and then and there show cause, if any they have, why distribution of the residue of said estate should not be made among the heirs at law of said deceased, according to law and the respective rights of all the parties; and, also, at the same place, immediately after decree of distribution of said estate is made, without further notice, to show cause why said court shall not make an order appointing commissioners, or a commissioner, as it may seem best, to make partition and division of said estate among the heirs at law of said deceased, according to the respective rights of the parties and the decree of distribution, and to set aside to each his and her share, according to the proportions decreed to him, her, or them, or to report his or their inability to make partition of the whole or certain part or parts of said estate without sale, or without prejudice or inconvenience, and also to report and find the true value of all said real estate belonging to said estate.
"And it is further ordered, that notice of the foregoing be given by publication, and that a copy hereof be published once a week for four successive weeks, before said 23d day of March, 1875, in the Daily Eearminer, a daily newspaper printed and published in said city and county."
Subsequently, the Probate Court made the following order: "Whereas, Chas. H. Sawyer, a competent attorney at law, has hitherto represented Horace Hawes and Caroline C. Hawes, minors, heirs of said deceased: "It is now by the court here ordered, that said Chas. I. Sawyer, an attorney at law and of this court, be and is hereby appointed to represent said minors, Horace Hawes and Caroline C. Hawes, in the partition and distribution of said estate and all other proceedings, when all of the parties in said estate or said heirs are required to be notified thereof. "Done in open court this 29th day of March, 18,75.1' On the same day a decree was passed, "J. C. Bates appearing on behalf of said administratrix, and Chas. H. Sawyer, Esq., appearing on behalf of Horace Hawes and Caroline

d. Hawes. children of said deceased," - which found and declared: That it appeared to the satisfaction of the court that due and sufficient notice of the time and place of hearing of said petition for distribution and partition had been given, as required by law; that the final accounts of the administratrix had been duly settled by the court, and that the estate was "in proper condition for distribution and partition, and to be finally closed;" that certain portions of said real estate were common property, and the residue was separate property; that the widow was entitled to an undivided half, and the two children together to an undivided half, of the former, while the widow and the children were each entitled to an undivided one-third of the latter. It was adjudged and decreed that all the acts and records of the administratrix, appearing upon the records of the estate, be approved and confirmed, and that the residue of said estate "be and the same is hereby distributed" as follows: One undivided half of Mission Block No. 44, and the southeasterly part of Mission Block No. 8, less a certain school lot, to Caroline Hawes, and the other undivided half to the two children; and an undivided third to the widow of Mission Block No. 2, the fifty-vara lot No. 205, and of the lands in San Mateo County; and the remaining two-thirds thereof, undivided, to the children, share and share alike. The decree concludes with a particular description of the several parcels of land so distributed.
The judgment-roll of the proceedings in the Probate Court also contains this order:
"The petition of Caroline Hlawes, administratrix and heir at law of the estate of Horace Hawes, deceased, for partition of said estate, according to law, coming on regularly to be heard this 29th day of March, 1875, immediately after the decree distributing said real estate being made, J.

Hawes, minor heirs of said deceased, and upon consent in open court of all parties interested to the appointment of James L. King, sole commissioner for the purposes of partition and division of the estate of said deceased:

Statement of the Case.
"And said court deeming it just and proper that said James
L. King be appointed sole commissioner for such purposes, and all and singular the law and the premises being by the court here seen, heard, understood, and fully considered:
"Whereupon, it is now by the court here ordered, adjudged, and decreed that partition and division of said real estate, described in the decree of distribution herein, be made in accordance with the rights of the parties as determined by said decree of distribution.
"And it is further ordered, that the said James L. King be and he is hereby appointed sole commissioner for that purpose, and whose duty it shall be to make partition and division of said real estate described in said decree of distribution, in accordance with the rights and interests of the respective parties as therein determined, and make report of the proceedings and partition in writing to this court.
"Done in open court this twenty-ninth day of March, A. D. 1875."
On the 2d of April, 1875, Charles II. Sawyer, as said attorney for the minor heirs, and J. C. Bates, as attorney for the widow and administratrix, acknowledged service of a written notice from King, as commissioner, that he would, on the eighth day of that month and year, at his office, in the city of San Francisco, "proceed to make partition of the property described in the decree of distribution in [of] said estate, in accordance with the rights of respective parties as therein described."
On the 13th of April, 1875, the commissioner made his report in which it is stated that, in making the division and partition of the property, he was attended by Mr. Sawyer, as attorney for the minor heirs of the decedent, and by Mr. Bates, as attorney for the widow; that, after a thorough examination of the premises, he made the partition and division, the estate in each county being divided separately among all the heirs as .if there were no other estate to be divided. He allotted to the widow and the two children each an undivided one-third of all the land in San Mateo County; to the widow one-half, and to the children one-fourth each, of Mission Block No. 44, in

the city of San Francisco, each part being described by metes and bounds; to the widow, the southeasterly part of :Mission Block No. 8, in the same city; to the children, each, one-half of Mission Block No. 2, in San Francisco, each part being described by metes and bounds; and to the widow, the whole of said fifty-vara lot, being 137- feet square. This report was confirmed on the 19th of April, 1875,the order of confirmation reciting, among other things, the appearance of Bates for the widow and of Sawyer as the attorney appointed to defend for the minor heirs.
Chapter X of the Code of Civil Procedure treats "of accounts rendered by executors and administrators, and of the payment of debts." Among the provisions in that chapter is one to the effect that if the account rendered by an executor or administrator "is for a 'final settlement, and the estate is ready for distribution and partition, the notice thereof required to be published must state these facts; and on confirmation of the final account, distribution and partition of the estate to all entitled thereto must be immediately had, without further notice or proceeding."
The succeeding chapter relates to the "Partition, Distribution, and Final Settlement of Estates." By § 1665 it is provided that "upon the final settlement of the accounts of the executor or administrator, or at any subsequent time, upon the application of the executor or administrator, or of any heir, legatee, or devisee, the court must proceed to distribute the residue of the estate in the hands of the executor or administrator, if any, among the persons who by law are entitled thereto."
"Section 1666. In the order or decree the court must name the persons, and the proportions or parts to which each shall be entitled, and such persons may demand, sue for, and recover their respective shares from the executor or administrator, or any person having the same in possession. Such order or decree is conclusive as to the rights of heirs, legatees, or devisees, subject only to be reversed, set aside, or modified on appeal."
"Section 1668. The order or decree may be made on the

ROBINSON v. FAIR.
Statement of the Case.
petition of the executor or administrator, or of any person interested in the estate. Notice of the application must be given by posting or publication, as the court may direct, and for such time as may be ordered. If partition be applied for as provided in this chapter the decree of distribution shall not divest the court of jurisdiction to order partition, unless the estate is finally closed."
"Section 1675. When the estate, real orpersonal, assigned by the decree of distribution to two or more heirs, devisees, or legatees, is in common and undivided, and the respective shares are not separated and distinguished, partition or distribution may be made by three disinterested persons, to be appointed commissioners for that purpose by the Probate Court or judge, who must be duly sworn to the faithful discharge of their duties. A certified copy of the order of their appointment, and of the order or decree assigning and distributing the estate, must be
issued to them as their warrant, and their oath must be indorsed thereon. Upon consent of the parties, or when the court deems it proper and just, it is sufficient to appoint one commissioner only, who has the same authority, and is governed by the same rules as if three were appointed.
"Section 1676. Such partition may be ordered and had in the Probate Court on the petition of any person interested. But before commissioners are appointed, or partition ordered by the Probate Court, as directed in this chapter, notice thereof must be given to all persons interested, who reside in this State, or to their guardians, and to the agents, attorneys or guardians, if a~ny in this State, of such as reside out of the State, either personally or by public notice, as the Probate Court may direct. The petition may be filed, attorneys, guardians, and agents appointed, and notice given at any time before the order or decree of distribution, but the commissioners must not be appointed until the order or decree is made distributing the estate.
"Section 1677. If the real estate is in different counties, the Probate Court may, if deemed proper, appoint commissioners for all, or different commissioners for each county. The estate in each county must be divided separately among the heirs,

devisees, or legatees, as if there was no other estate to be divided, but the commissioners first appointed must, unless otherwise directed by the Probate Court, make division of such real estate, wherever situated within this State.
"Section 1678. Partition or distribution of the real estate may be made as provided in this chapter, although some of the original heirs, legatees, or devisees may have conveyed their shares to other persons, and such shares must be assigned to the person holding the same, in the same manner as they otherwise would have been to such heirs, legatees, or devisees.
"Section 1679. When both distribution and partition are made, the several shares in the real and personal estate must be set out to each individual in proportion to his right, by metes and bounds, or description, so that the same can be easily distinguished, unless two or more of the parties interested consent to have their shares set out so as to be held by them in common and undivided.
"Section 1680. When the real estate cannot be divided without prejudice or inconvenience t6 the owners, the Probate Court may assign the whole to one or more of the parties entitled to share therein, who will accept it, always preferring the males to the females, and among children preferring the -elder to the younger. The parties accepting the whole must pay to the other parties interested their just proportion of the true value thereof, or secure the same to their satisfaction, or, in case of the minority of such party, then to the satisfaction of his guardian, and the true value of the estate must be ascertained and reported by the commissioners. When the commissioners appointed to make partition are of the opinion that the real estate cannot be divided without prejudice or inconvenience to the owners, they must so report -to the court, and recommend that the whole be assigned as herein provided, and must find and report the true value of such real estate. On filing the report of the commissioners, and on making or securing the payment, as before provided, the court, if it appears just and proper, must confirm the report, and thereupon the assignment is cqmplete, and the title to the whole of such real estate vests in the person to whom the same is so assigned.

ROBLNSON v. FAIR.
Statement of the Case.
"Section 1681. When any tract of land or tenement is of greater value than any one's share in the estate to be divided, and cannot be divided without injury to the same, it may be set off by the commissioners appointed to make partition to any of the parties who will accept it, giving preference as prescribed in the preceding section. The party accepting must pay or secure to the others such sums as the commissioners shall award to make the partition equal, and the commissioners must make their award accordingly; but such partition must not be established by the court until the sums awarded are paid to the parties entitled tothe same, or secured to their satisfaction.
"Section 1682. When it appears to the court, from the commissioners' report, that it cannot otherwise be fairly divided, and should be sold, the court may order the sale of the whole or any part of the estate, real or personal, by the executor or administrator, or by a commissioner appointed for that purpose, and the proceeds distributed. The sale must be conducted, reported, and confirmed in the same manner and under the same requirements provided in Article IV, Chapter VII of this Title.
'" Section 1683. Before any partition is made or any estate divided, as provided in this chapter, notice must be given to all persons interested in the partition, their guardians, agents, or attorneys, by the commissioners, of the time and place, when and where they shall proceed to make partition. The commissioners may take testimony, order surveys, and take such other steps as may be necessary to enable them to form a judgment upon the matters before them.
"Section 1684. The commissioners must report their pr6-, ceedings, and the partition agreed upon by them, to the Probate Court, in writing, and the court may, for sufficient reasons, set aside the report and commit the same to the same commissioners, or appoint others; and when such report is finally confirmed, a certified copy of the judgment or decree of partition made thereon, attested by the clerk, under the seal of the court, must be recorded in the office of the recorder of the county where the land lies.

"Section 1685. When the Probate Court makes a judgment
or decree assigning the residue of any estate to one or more persons entitled to the same, it is not necessary to appoint commissioners to make partition or distribution thereof, unless the parties to whom the assignment is decreed, or some of them, request that such partition be made.
"Section 1686. All questions as to advancements made, or alleged to have been made, by the decedent to his heirs, may be heard and determined by the Probate Court, and must be specified in the decree assigning and distributing the estate; and the final judgment or decree of the Probate Court, or, in case of appeal, of the Supreme Court, is binding on all parties interested in the estate."
.Mr. J. C. Bates and _A&. John A. Campbell for plaintiffs in error.
The Constitution of 1863 was in force during the period covering the probate partition proceedings impeached in this case.
That Constitution provided for several courts, and declared and conferred their several jurisdictions.
It is evident that a Probate Court is erected by § 8, Art. VI, of that instrument, for each county, to consist of the county judge sitting as a judge of probate.
The common law and equity jurisdiction is divided between the County Court sitting as a court of law of general jurisdiction, and the District Court sitting as a court of, general law and equity jurisdiction.
The former is given jurisdiction of actions of forcible entry and detainer, to prevent or abate nuisances of special proceedings and cases, and such criminal jurisdiction as the legislature shall prescribe.
The latter is given jurisdiction in all cases in equity, in all cases at law involving the title or possession of real property or the legality of any tax, etc., and in all other cases in which the demand, exclusive of interest, or the value of the property in controversy, amounts to $300.

ROBINSON v. FAIR.
Argument for Plaintiffs in Error.
The statute, authorizing the partition proceedings had in this case by the Probate Court, can only be valid on the assumption that the Constitution has either expressly vested jurisdiction over partition proceedings in the Probate Court, or has authorized the legislature to do so. The legislature cannot enlarge the jurisdiction of a constitutional court; Came,'orm v. Kenfeld, 57 Cal. 550; or vest in another court that jurisdiction which the Constitution has placed in one designated therein. Zander v. Coe, 5 Cal. 230; Appeal of 8. 0. Houghton, 42 Cal. 35; Will of Bowen, 34 Cal. 682; Willis v. arley, 24 Cal. 490; Tilson v. Roach, 4 Cal. 362; Rosenberg v. rank, 58 Cal. 387.
The Constitution has vested jurisdiction over partition proceedings in the District Court as a court of equity by virtue of the grant of jurisdiction "in all cases in equity" where the remedy is sought in equity; and as a court of law, under the jurisdiction given of all cases at law which involve the title or possession of real property; where the remedy is sought in partition proceedings at law. This jtarisdiction is thus vested because partition proceedings under the settled principles of' our jurisprudence, in the light of which the Constitution! speaks, are proceedings in equity or at law, and are cases in. equity or at law according as the one forum or the other is. sought.
Actions at law for partition existed at the common layw in, the case of Parceners prior to the reign of Henry VIII, and, in that reign the right to a writ of partition was given to tenants in common. 1 Washburn Real Prop. c. 13, § 7; 1 Spence.
Eq. Jur. 162; Freeman, Co-tenancy and Partition, § 420.
Courts of equity assumed a jurisdiction over partition proceedings based not upon statute, but upon the inadequacy of: the legal remedy. 1 Spence Eq. Jur. 642, 653, 654; Freeman, Co-tenancy and Partition, § 423.
Partition jurisdiction, being a twofold jurisdiction, one at law, the other in equity, conferred by the Constitution upon. the District Court, such jurisdiction was exclusive in that court. It could not be vested by the legislature, either as a. concurrent or an exclusive jurisdiction in another court, unless;
VOL.' CXx-VM-5

OCTOBER TERM, 1888.

authority to that effect was given expressly or by necessary implication by the Constitution.
The grant of probate jurisdiction is in these words: "The county judges shall also hold in their several counties Probate Court, and perform such duties as probate judges as may be prescribed by law." If partition jurisdiction is or may be vested in the Probate Court, it must be either because the last clause, "as may be prescribed by law," empowers the legislature to impress a jurisdiction properly at law or in equity with a probate character, and thereupon vest it in the Probate Court, or, in other words, to vest in the Probate Court other than strictly probate jurisdiction; or because probate jurisdiction, either as received from the English law or as remodelled in America, includes a limited partition jurisdiction as a part and incident thereof. Neither position is tenable.
In Rosenberg v. Ftrank, 58 Cal. 402, the court said: "It seems from the above [Art. VI, § 8, Cal. Const.] that the legislature may make the jurisdiction of the probate judge or court what it pleases, within the limits of that jurisdiction which is understood as usually pertaining to Probate Courts. But the position that it can, under this power, take away from the District Courts any of the equity jurisdiction conferred on them by the Constitution, is manifestly untenable."
Similar clauses have been construed as not empowering the legislature to extend the powers of a Probate Court beyond the proper and established bounds of the established probate jurisdiction, as known to American and English jurisprudence. Feris v. fHigley, 20 Wall. 373; Cast v. Cast, 1 Utah, 112; Locknane v. A-fartin, McKahon (Kan.), 60; -Moore v. -iToubly, 1 Idaho, 54. The construction is rational.
The conclusion is irresistible from the foregoing considerations, that § 8 of Art. VI authorizes the legislature to confer on the Probate Court _probate powers a/nd jurisdiction,and those only. Unless the power to partition among heirs is a probate power, and the jurisdiction over partition proceedings is a part of the probate jurisdiction recognized in the AngloAmerican jurisprudence, the provisions of the statute and code

ROBINSON v. FAIR.
Argument for Plaintiffs in Error.
for partition by the Probate Court were void, and the partition proceedings, under which the defendant in this action claims, were cora~f' nonjudiee and absolutely void.
Partition is not a part of the probate jurisdiction derived from England and exercised in America by Probate or Surrogate Courts.
The Probate and Surrogate Courts in America are the lineal successors of the ecclesiastical courts of Great Britain. Payne's Will, 4 T. B. Mon. 423.
Our state constitutions recognize three civil jurisdictions, derived from the jurisprudence of England: law, equity and probate, and distribute them to the several tribunals. To the limits of these several jurisdictions, as exercised by the several judicatories of England, our courts look for the boundaries of the judications deposited by our organic laws in the several state courts. The jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts was exercised, with certain exceptions immaterial for the purpose of this head, over the personal estate only. Toller's Executors, 67, 80. The mere distribution or declaration of the rights of the next of kin to the undisposed-of residue in the case of intestacy, and the enforcement of the surrender by the administrator, an officer of the court, to the kin of that residue, was the extent of the power exercised by the ecclesiastical courts.
The partition of that residue was left to the voluntary action of the kin, or to their coerced action in obedience to the decree of a court of law or equity.
Although there is a seeming appropriateness in the exercise of a limited power of partition by the Probate Court, and although on a superficial view, such a power appears to be analogous to, and a legitimate extension of the process of distribution, yet neither position is true. The inappropriateness of the exercise of such a power becomes more apparent -when the incongruous and alien nature of that portion of the activity of a Probate Court has been demonstrated and illustrated. Partition is not analogous to and is not a legitimate extension of the process of distribution. This proposition is based upon the distinction between partition and probate proceedings in natures, object and operation. This distinction is twofold.

OCTOBER TERMI, 1888.
Argument for Plaintiffs in Error.
1. Briefly stated, the object of administration is not to enforce a remedial right, or to transfer property. Its exclusive purpose and operation is to manage the estate as in receivership for the payment of debts and to announce authoritatively a legal succession. No proceeding of the former description properly belongs to administration. Partition involves an enforcement by the judicial decree of a remedial right and the motion of property rights intervivos.
2. Administration has exclusively to do with rights which spring from the succession, i.e., out of the fact and process of inheritance. When the Probate Court deals with other rights, it departs from its legitimate conventional and customary sphere, and overleaps the boundaries of its jurisdiction.
This character of the probate jurisdiction runs through the entire Anglo-American jurisprudence.
The jurisdiction is a jurisdiction of management over an undisputed fund in the custody of the court for administration purposes, - to wit, for the payment of debts and for the support of the family during administration. The moment activities diverging from this narrow thread of function are required, the domain of a diverse jurisdiction, not a jurisdiction of management but a remedial jurisdiction, must be entered.
The Probate Court can appoint an executor or administrator, and direct him, by successive orders extending to the close of the administration, to collect assets, to sell property, to pay debts, to apply so much of the funds in his hands as shall be necessary to defray funeral expenses and to support the family and to protect the fund, and finally direct him to deliver so much of the funds as shall be necessary in satisfaction of legacies and to surrender the residue to the heirs.
All activities outside this narrow channel, bounded in the beginning by the death and at the end by the distribution, and laterally by the limits of management, belong to law or equity. And the test of the new province, and of the externality from the terminal or lateral boundaries of the probate jurisdiction, is the question whether those activities involve adversary litigation involving remedial rights and issuing in judgments enforcing such rights by the transfer of property.

ROBINSON v. FAIR.
Argument for Plaintiffs in Error.
The proceedings in a Probate Court, preceding distribution, are not in any particular adversary proceedings, involving the assertion of a remedial right, and issuing in a judgment accomplishing a transfer of property rights. The decree of distribution is equally devoid of that character. It neither gives, creates, nor transfers any rights of property.
The proceedings resulting in the decree are in the nature of an inquisition to ascertain who are the persons upon whom the law has cast the succession and to what interests. The decree, when pronounced, is simply declaratory. It announces what rights were given at the death by the law, and to whom: It is a declaration which concludes all parties to the proceeding. But it does not purport, and in theory of law does not create or transfer any rights. If in practice it thus operates, it is in consequence of error in the exercise of jurisdiction.
Partition, on the contrary, is essentially an adversary proceeding in which a remedial right to the transfer of property is asserted, and a proceeding issuing in a judgment amoving or transferring that property.
Where partition by judicial proceedings is had between two tenants in common, an interchange of property rights is accomplished by the judgment. The right of possession to one moiety of the lands by metes and bounds is divested from one tenant and transferred to the other. He is compelled to accept, as a substitute, the right of possession theretofore belonging to the other tenant to the moiety by metes and bounds assigned to him. The property of which he is divested is the title and right of possession of a tract of land awarded to the other, together with the incident rights, the right of entry, the right of user, the right to maintain trespass, etc. The proceeding is strictly analogous to a proceeding in equity, to compel the specific performance of a contract to exchange land. The contract of exchange being established, the law gives a remedial right to each party to the reciprocal exchange of the titles and rights of possession of the respective parcels of' land. The judgment ex propiio vigore (under the laws of some States), or as executed, accomplishes the transfer.
In partition, the fact of the tenancy being established, the

OCTOBER TERMA, 1888.
Argument for Plaintiffs in Error.
law gives a remedial right to the reciprocal exchange of the ,right of possession with the incident rights, to several distinct moieties of the entire tract and of the title to undivided moieties of such moieties. The judgment accomplishes the change.
But there are two matters of law which establish beyond possible question or cavil, that in partition, property consisting both of title and right of possession is and must be transferred by the judgment in possession.
(1) This results from the fact that at common law partition could not be accomplished without the transfer of an estate by the voluntary act of the parties. And the judicial proceeding is a compulsory transfer by and through the judgment of a court, substituted for the voluntary process by the parties.
(2) That partition involves the transfer of an estate or property is evidenced by the theory and foundation of the proceeding in equity to compel the specific performance of a parol partition.
The statute of frauds is satisfied by the part performance accomplished by the actual severance of possession. Equity will treat each tenant as possessed of the legal title to one-half of his allotment and of the equitable title to the other half of the same, and will compel a conveyance by the cotenant. This proceeds exclusively on the theory that each tenant in common can have a title to one-half only, of any specified parcel of the whole tract, and can only acquire the other half through the medium of a conveyance. Freeman Cotenantry and Partition, § 402 and cases cited.
Administration has exclusively to do with rights which spring out of the fact of succession. When it deals with other rights, it departs from its legitimate, conventional and customary sphere.
Partition deals with a remedial right springing out of the nature of the property and attaching thereto under a law other than that of succession.
The exercise of a power of partition by the Probate Court is in no sense appropriate. It is an incongruous and alien activity as established by the foregoing discussion. It is also

ROBINSON v. FAIR.
Argument for Plaintiffs in Error.
inappropriate by reason of the inadequate powers of that court. The Probate Court can only partition the legal interest cast. It can determine no other title. It cannot adjust, as can equity, the equities between the parties; making pro, visions for liens and incumbrances and variant values in different parcels of the property.
The Probate Court exercises, under our law, more extensive powers in the administration of estates than did the ecclesiastical courts of England. For instance; American courts, under statute authority, take jurisdiction of wills of real estate, and in all cases, whether of testacy or intestacy, land is assets to be administered upon. Yet no such powers were exercised by the ecclesiastical courts. American courts render decrees of distribution in cases of testacy as well as of intestacy, yet the ecclesiastical courts could render no such decree except in case of intestacy. The American Probate Courts exercise also, by authority of statute, more enlarged powers in the direction and control of executors and administrators.
In none of these cases is more done by the legislature than to grant to a tribunal, whose powers are strictly dependent upon statute, more extended powers within its legitimate domain. So long as the powers granted consist in nothing more than powers over its officers and the estate in its custody for administration, or in powers to announce judicially the course of succession, the bounds of its legitimate jurisdiction are not passed. The moment the court is given power to entertain proceedings to enforce remedial rights, and to render judgments amoving, or, when executed, accomplishing the amotion of property, that moment the boundaries of its jurisdiction are passed.
Wherever partition powers are or have been exercised by Probate Courts, in the United States, it has been by express authority of statute and as an alien power in the Probate Court.
Had a limited partition power been generally exercised by Probate Courts in the United States, as an incident of distribution in the absence of statutory authorization, this fact might warrant the inference, that in the opinion of the bench and

OCTOBER TERM, 1888.

bar of America, such power belonged to the immemorial probate jurisdiction. But where the power is exclusively statutory and so recognized wherever exercised, the fact of its exercise has no tendency to establish that it is a legitimate part of probate jurisdiction.
The power exercised by Probate Courts to partition, wherever it exists is based on statute. ALABAMA: see Toulman's Digest of the Laws of Alabama, 1823, 333, § 43; Ala. Code, 1852, § 670; Rev.

(JuI',e v. Stewart, ubi &usoqa; Davenport v. Caldwell, ubi supi)a; Srmith v. Craig,ubi supra; Wainwr-igkt v. Dorr,ubi supy a; Griee v. Randall, ubi supra. The sole question in this case is, were the proceedings in partition in the Probate Court of San Francisco without jurisdiction? Of course, if the court has jurisdiction of the proceedings and the persons, whether it be a court of inferior or general jurisdiction, the decision of the Probate Court is conclusive except on appeal. The cases cited on behalf of the defendant in error all proceed on the assumption that the Probate Court had jurisdiction in the States in question, and the presumption was correct. In this case and in California the contention is that the Probate Court had no jurisdiction; that the proceedings were absolutely void and not merely voidable; and it is an elementary principle that such proceedings are nullities and subject to collateral as well as direct attack.

OCTOBER TERMI, 1888.
Argument for Plaintiffs in Error.
In the absence of a constitutional distribution of jurisdictions, and in the absence of an express or necessarily implied prohibition, it is beyond doubt, that the legislature can vest a particular jurisdiction in any court it may appoint. For the purpose, therefore, of determining the constitutionality of the California statute, a distinction must be taken between the decisions of those States where such constitutional distributions of jurisdictions and prohibitions exist and of those States where they do not. The legislation, practice, and decisions of the latter must be laid aside.
It is argued that the statute simply brings into this State the practice and usage in the matter of partition by Probate Courts which generally prevail in other States. It is urged by inference that the constitution, in providing probate jurisdiction in the Probate Court, contemplated that jurisdiction, not in its purity and simplicity as derived from Great Britain, but as amplified in America. It is supposed that the jurisdiction in question has been remodelled in America by the practice of the States, and partition power incorporated into it, and that the state constitution speaks with reference to that American probate jurisdiction.
But to adopt such a principle is to violate all the rules of construction to enable the significance of constitutional provisions to vary with variable custom, and to enable a judicial remodelling, according to the whim of the times, of our constitutions, destructive of the rigidity and integrity of our constitutional framework of government. It is not true that there is an American probate jurisdiction different in essential quality and nature from that of the courts of administration of England. It is true that a partition power has been expressly conferred upon Probate Courts in certain States; but this has not been done in all, and, in fact, has been done in less than a majority.
Such a power has been so conferred in Maine, Alassachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Alabama, Rhode Island, Indiana, Ohio, and Tennessee.
In M1ississippi the court, by virtue of its constitutional juris-

diction over orphans' business, can partition an estate where some of the tenants in common are minors.
In Texas and Louisiana, the same court has constitutional jurisdiction over matters at law and in equity and of administration.
In Kentucky and North Carolina the same court is a court of law and equity and a Court of Probate, but the partition power is not given to it as a Probate Court.
In South Carolina, although up to 1814 the Probate Court had a statutory partition power, yet it is held that such power is not a part of the probate jurisdiction.
But no such power has been conferred upon the Probate Court in New York, Virginia, West Virginia, Georgia, Florida, Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, Arkansas, Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, and Maryland. In the latter State jurisdiction to partition the estates of decedents was given to the county courts by the statute of November, 1786, c. 45, § 8; while under the act of February, 1'777, § 8, the orphans' court had exclusive probate jurisdiction. This distinction continues at the present time. Revised Code, Maryland, 1878, 430-432 and 407-8.
On no assumption can it be maintained, as a matter of law, that the power of partition was a part of the probate jurisdiction, which it was competent for the legislature to vest in Probate Courts under the California Constitution of 1863.
That power was indisputably no part of the probate jurisdiction derived from England.
Wherever the question has been decided, the American courts have pronounced it no part of the probate jurisdiction, as specified by the constitutions.
On principle, it belongs to the jurisdictions at law and in equity, and not to probate.
Wherever such a power has been exercised in America, by Probate Courts, it has been by virtue of express statute, and in all such cases the constitutional power to enact such statutes existed in the legislature, by reason of the absence of express or implied constitutional prohibitions.
On no substantial principle can the Constitution of California be made to speak with reference to the variant practice of

a minority of the States, so as to make the probate jurisdiction conferred by that Constitution comprehend that statutory power of partition deposited in Probate Courts in those States.
The counsel further contended: (1) that the administratrix was not a competent party to prosecute a suit for the partition of the real property, which had descended to the heirs at law, and was in the possession of the heirs at the time when the consent order of the two attorneys and of the court was adopted; (2) that the order made, appointing the commissioner, had no validity; (3) that the minor heirs had not been served with any process, directly, nor by service upon a general guardian or a guardian ad litem; (4) that the Probate Court had no authority to appoint an attorney of the court to represent these parties in this cause, nor to bind them by any agreement he should make; (5) that the Court of Probate did not acquire jurisdiction over the persons of these plaintiffs.
.2fr.Samuel -M. Wilson for defendant in error.
Mn JUsTicn- HAnLA, after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the court.
.The principal assignment of error is, that, under the Constitution of California prior to 1880, the Probate Court could not take jurisdiction of a proceeding to partition real estate. It is contended that its control over the estate ceased when it approved the final settlement, and, by a decree of distribution, defined the nature and extent of the interests of the heirs in the remaining estate of the decedent. A partition severing the unity of possession among the heirs, and investing each with a. right, as against the others, to the exclusive possession and ownership of distinct parts of the estate, could not, it is insisted, have been constitutionally effected by proceedings in a Probate Court. These questions have received the most careful consideration, as well because of their intrinsic importance, as because their determination by this court, as we are informed by counsel, may seriously affect the title to large bodies of land in California.

ROBINSON v. FAIR.
Opinion of the Court.
Tracing the course of legislation in California in reference to the jurisdiction and powers of the Probate Courts of that State, we find that the first statute upon the subject is that of April 22, 1850, entitled "An Act to regulate the Settlement of the Estates of Deceased Persons." Stat. California, 1850-53, c. 129, p. 377. Another statute was passed May 1, 1851, having a similar title, and covering the same subject. Compiled Laws California 1850, c.120, pp. 377 to 423. The provisions of these statutes relating to proceedings in the Probate Courts for the final settlement, distribution, and partition of estates were continued without material change, and the powers of those courts enlarged, by the Code of Civil Procedure. The sections of the code bearing upon the question of the jurisdiction and powers of those courts are too numerous to be incorporated in this opinion. It is sufficient to say that upon a careful examination of them, we are of opinion that it was the intention of the legislature to invest Probate Courts with authority, in connection with, and as ancillary or supplementary to, the settlement and distribution of estates, to make partition of real property - where the title of the deceased owner and the heirship of .the parties are undisputed-so as to invest each heir with a separate title to the particular part or parts allotted to him by the decree of partition. No other interpre-
tation is consistent with the words of the code. §§ 1581, 1634,
1665, 1666, 1668, 1675, 1676 to 1686, inclusive. Does the state constitution prohibit the partition of real
estate by proceedings in a Probate Court ? The contention of the plaintiffs is, that exclusive original jurisdiction of such proceedings is given to District Courts, and that partition is foreign to the probate system as recognized in that instrament.
By the constitution of California, in force at the time partition was made of the estate in question, the judicial power of the State was "vested in a Supreme Court, in District Courts, in County Courts, in Probate Courts, and in justices of the peace, and in such Recorders' and other inferior courts as the legislature may establish in any incorporated city or town;" and the Supreme Court, the District, County, Probate, and

OCTOBER TERM, 1888.

such other courts as the legislature should prescribe, were declared to be courts of record. Const. of 1849, amended in 1862, Art. VI, §§ 1, 9. The Supreme Court is invested with appellate jurisdiction in all cases in equity; in all cases at law involving the title or possession of real estate, or the legality of any tax, impost, assessment, toll or municipal fine, or in which the demand, exclusive of interest, or the value of the property in controversy, amounts to tlree hundred dollars; in all cases arising in the Probate Courts; and in all criminal cases amounting to felony, on questions of law. It also has "power to issue writs of mandamus, certiorari, prohibition, and habeas corpus, and also all writs necessary or proper to the complete exercise of its appellate jurisdiction." Id. § 4.
The constitution of 1849 provided that the District Courts "shall have original jurisdiction in law and equity in all civil cases where the amount in dispute exceeds two hundred dollars, exclusive of interest. In all criminal cases not otherwise provided for, and in all issues of fact joined in the Probate Courts, their jurisdiction shall be unlimited." Const. 1849, Art. VI, § 6. But in 1862 the constitution was amended, and in lieu of that section the following was substituted: "The District Courts shall have original jurisdiction in all cases in equity; also, in all cases at law which involve the title or possession of real property, or the legality of any tax, impost, assessment, toll, or municipal fine, and in all other cases in which the demand, exclusive of interest or the value of the property in controversy, amounts to three hundred dollars; and also in all criminal cases not otherwise provided for. The District Courts and their judges shall have power to issue writs of kabeas corpus, on petition by or on behalf of any person held in actual custody, in their respective districts." Const. 1862, Art. VI, § 6.
The constitution of 1849, also, provided for the election of a county judge in each organized county, who "shall hold the County Court, and perform the duties of surrogate or probate judge," and, with two justices of the peace, "shall hold Courts of Sessions, with such criminal jurisdiction as the legislature shall prescribe; and he shall perform such other duties as

Opinion of the Court.

shall be required by law." It was further provided that "the County Courts shall have such jurisdiction in cases arising in justices' courts, and in special cases, as the legislature may prescribe, but shall have no original civil jurisdiction except in such special cases." Const. 1849, Art. VI, §§ 8 and 9. But by the amendments of 1862 the powers and jurisdiction of County Courts were greatly enlarged, as will be seen from the following section adopted in lieu of those just cited: "Section 8. The County Courts'shall have original jurisdiction of actions of forcible entry and detainer, of proceedings in insolvency, of actions to prevent or abate a nuisance, and of all such special cases and proceedings as are not otherwise provided for; and also such criminal jurisdiction as the legislature may prescribe; they shall also have appellate jurisdiction in all cases arising in courts held by justices of the peace and recorders, and in such inferior courts as may be established in pursuance of section one of this article, in their respective counties. The county judges shall also hold in their several counties Probate Courts, and perform such duties as probate judges as may be prescribed by law. The county courts and their judges shall also have power to issue writs of habeas corpus, on petition by or on behalf of any person in actual custody in their respective counties."
The argument in behalf of the plaintiffs, briefly stated, is,
that the legislature could not confer upon County Courts jurisdiction of suits or matters of which original jurisdiction is given by the constitution to District Courts; that whether a proceeding for partition be regarded as a case in equity, or a case at law involving the title or possession of real property, it is within the original, and, therefore, exclusive jurisdiction of a District Court; and that the provision requiring county judges to hold "Probate Courts," "and perform such duties as probate judges as may be prescribed by law," did not authorize the legislature to invest Probate Courts with jurisdiction, concurrent with District Courts, in cases of which the latter were, by express words, given original jurisdiction. It must be confessed that some support for this position is found in the general language employed in Zander v. Coe, 5

OCTOBER TER.M, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.
California., 230, People v. .Fowler, 9 California, 85, and Caulfield v. Stevens, 28 California, 118. In Zander v. Coe, the court proceeded upon the ground that the legislature could not confer on one court the functions and powers which had been conferred by the constitution upon another court. In People v. F2owler, 9 California, 85 - where the question was as to the constitutionality of a statute giving an appeal to the Court of Sessions from a judgment in a criminal case tried in a justice's court -the court, referring" to Zander v. Coe, and previous cases, said: "The rule of construction established by these decisions is this: That when certain powers are, in form affirmatively, bestowed upon certain courts, they are still exclusive, unless there be some exception specified in the constitution itself, or the power to prescribe the cases to which the jurisdiction should extend be expressly given to the legislature. For example: there is affirmatively conferred upon the District Courts certain original jurisdiction in civil cases, and there is no specified exception stated, and no power expressly given to the legislature either to limit or increase this jurisdiction; therefore it is, as to the class of cases enumerated, exclusive."
In Caulfeld v. Stevens, 28 California, 118, the court declared to be unconstitutional an act empowering justices of the peace to try actions for forcible entry, or forcible or unlawful detainer. Its validity was attempted to be maintained under the general grant to the legislature of power to fix by law the "powers, duties, and responsibilities" of justices of the peace. Const. 1862, Art. VI, § 9. But the court held that the subject of forcible entries and of forcible and unlawful detainers was expressly committed by the constitution to County Courts, and that the act there in question was unconstitutional. Whether the court had in view the rule of constitutional construction announced in Zander v. Coe and People v. Fowler, it is impossible to say; for no reference is made to either case. As pointed out in Courtwrightv. Bear River &c. Xining Co., 30 California, 573, the decision in Caueld v. Stevens went beyond what was necessary to be decided; it might have been rested entirely upon the ground that the constitution in terms

ROBINSON v. FAIR.
Opinion of the Court.
invested County Courts, declared to be courts of record, with original jurisdiction of actions of forcible entry and detainer, and the authority of the legislature to fix by law the powers, duties, and responsibilities of justices of the peace was burdened with the condition that "such powers shall not, in any case, trench upon the jurisdiction of the several courts of record." Section 9.
Prior to Caufidd v. Stevens, there were two decisions in the state court which seem to rest upon a different rule of constitutional construction, Estate of De Cast'o v. Bary, 18 California, 96, and Pery v. Aknes, 26 California, 372, 382. The first one was a suit for partition. It was brought in a Probate Court under § 264 of the Probate Act of 1851, (Compiled Laws of California, 1850-3, p. 415,) providing that "partition of the real estate may be made as provided in this chapter, although some of the original heirs or devisees may have conveyed their shares to other persons, and such shares shall be assigned to the person holding the same, in the same manner as they otherwise should have been to such heirs or devisees." That section - the words "or distribution" being added after "partition," and "legatees" after "heirs" - is in~orporated into the Code of Civil Procedure, § 1678. In that case the point was made that the Probate Court had no jurisdiction, because the petitioners were not heirs or devisees, and, therefore, not entitled to sue in the form adopted. But the jurisdiction of the Probate Court was sustained, on the ground that the statute placed alienees upon the same footing as the original heirs or devisees. While the authority of the Probate Court was not assailed upon the ground now asserted -namely, that the court could not, under the Constitution, entertain jurisdiction of a suit for partition-that question was xecessarily involved in the case; and the decree, which was affirmed, should have been reversed, if it be true that the jurisdiction of the Probate Court, in cases of partition, could not be made concurrent with that of the District Courts. In Perryv. Arnes, the question was as to the jurisdiction of District Courts, under the State Constitution as amended in 18 2, in cases of mandamus. It was contended that the Supreme
VOL. CXVHI-6

OCTOBER TERMI, 1888.

Court alone could issue a writ of mandamus, because upon that court had been conferred, in terms, power "to issue writs of mandamus, certiorari, prohibition, and habeas corpus, and also all writs necessary or proper to the complete exercise of its appellate jurisdiction," while no such power was expressly conferred upon the District Courts. It was decided that although the Supreme Court had been invested, in terms, with original jurisdiction in cases of mandamus, the District Courts had the same power, in respect to that species of remedy, by virtue of the general grant to them of jurisdiction in all civil cases in equity and in certain specified cases at law.
But the fullest discussion as to the general question is to be found in Cowu'twright v. Bear River, &e. .Xining Co., above cited. The principal point there was, whether a District Court could take jurisdiction of an action in equity to abate a nuisance. The latter court held that it could not, for the reason that original jurisdiction of an action to prevent or abate a nuisance is expressly granted to County Courts. Art. VI, § 8. But it was adjudged by the Supreme Court of the State that the jurisdiction of County Courts of such actions was only concurrent with that of District Courts -the latter having original jurisdiction of suits to abate nuisances under the general grant tW them of jurisdiction in cases in equity. It was held, that while the Constitution expressly provides that the powers conferred upon justices of the peace "shall not in any case trench upon the jurisdiction of the several courts of record" -thereby indicating that the jurisdiction conferred upon the several courts of record should be exclusive as against justices of the peace-no analogous provision was made as between the courts of record; and that, consequently, the Constitution did not forbid the Legislature from investing courts of record of the same order and grade with eqPal authority over any given cause or subject-matter of litigation. The court, also, said that "the cases are numerous which stand opposed to or are inconsistent with the idea of the complete distribution by the Constitution of judicial power among the several courts, and of their exclusive jurisdiction of all the subject-matters committed to them." "There are many mat-

ROBINSON v. FAIR.
Opinion of the Court.
ters," it observed, by way of illustration, "that we need not pause to specify, that would usually and properly pertain to the court exercising probate powers, as involved in the settlement of the estates of deceased persons, that may form the subject-matters of suits in equity and be properly litigated in the District Court." It referred to Perry v. Ames as sustaining the theory of concurrent jurisdiction, and pronounced that doctrine to be correct. It further said that the dictum in Cawuedd v. Stevens must yield to the decision in Perry v. Ames.
The doctrine of this case, upon the question of the concurrent jurisdiction of District and Probate Courts of actions in equity to abate nuisances, was reaffirmed in Yolo County v. City of Sacramento, 36 California, 193, 195.
The latest decision in the state court, to which our attention is called, which bears directly on the question of jurisdiction, is Rosenberg v. Frank, 58 California, 387, 402. In that case will be found some material qualification of the general language used in previous cases. That was a suit in equity, brought by executors in a District Court, for the purpose of obtaining a construction of a will. It was suggested that the Probate Court had jurisdiction of the subject-matter of the cause, and that its jurisdiction was, for that reason, exclusive. The court, adhering to the rule announced in the Courtwright case, held the authority of the District Court to be ample and plenary, under,the grant to it of original jurisdiction in cases in equity. After stating that the jurisdiction of Probate Courts is not defined in the Constitution, and referring to the provision that county judges shall "perform such duties as probate judges as may be prescribed by law," the court said: "It seems from the above that the legislature may make the jurisdiction of the probate judge or court what it pleases, within the limits of that jurisdiction which is understood as usually pertaining to Probate Courts." As late as Bw uoghs v. DVe Couts, '70 California, 361, 371, the court said: "Both Burroughs and Seamens are estopped by the decree of partition in probate from setting up title derived from Soto adverse to that of their co-tenants under the same title"- citing Code

OCTOBER TERM. 1888.
Opinion of the Court.
of Civil Procedure, § 1908; Freeman on Cotenancy and Partition, § 530-32; and Freeman on Judgments, § 249.
Whether it is to be fairly deduced from the broad language in previous decisions, that the legislature may confer upon Probate Courts concurrent jurisdiction as to every matter embraced within the grant of original jurisdiction to the District Courts, is a question which need not be now decided. It is only necessary to accept the decision in .Rosenberg v. Frank, as furnishing the constitutional test for determining the extent of the jurisdiction with which the Probate Courts of California may be endowed. The question, therefore, is, whether, after the final settlement of the accounts of a personal representative, and after a decree of distribution, defining the undivided interests of heirs in real estate in the hands of such representative - neither the title of the decedent nor the fact of heirship being disputed -the partition of such estate among the heirs, so as to invest them, separately, with the exclusive possession and ownership, as against co-heirs, of distinct parcels of such realty, is a subject-matter which may be committed to Probate Courts aceording to the jurisdiction usually pertaining to those tribunals.
We lay aside, as not open to dispute, the proposition that there is a difference between distribution and partition. And we are satisfied that that difference was in the mind of the legislature when it passed the original Probate Act, as well as when the Code of Civil Procedure was adopted. As correctly observed by counsel, distribution neither gives a new title to property, nor transfers a distinct right in the estate of the deceased owner, but is simply declaratory as to the persons upon whom the law casts the succession, and the extent of their respective interests; while partition, in most, if not in all, of its aspects, is an adversary proceeding, in which a remedial right to the transfer of property is asserted, and resultfng in a decree which, either ex _proprio vigore or as executed, accomplishes such transfer. But this difference is not sufficient in itself, "to solve the inquiry as to whether partition is so far alien to the probate system, as recognized by the Constitution of California, that the power to make it could

ROBINSON v. FAIR.
Opinion of the Court.
not be conferred upon Probate Courts; for, according to the doctrine of liosenberg v. Fi'ank, those tribunals may exercise whatever powers the legislature may, in its discretion, confer upon them, within the limits of such jurisdiction as usually pertains to Probate Courts. If, at the time the Constitution of California was adopted, the partition, by Probate Courts, among the heirs of a decedent, of undivided real estate, was unknown in the jurisprudence of this country, there would be ground, under the doctrine of Rosenbe'g v. Fr.ank, to contend that no such jurisdiction could be conferred upon Probate Courts in that State. But such is not the case. In a large number of the States, as the citations by counsel of statutes and decisions show, Probate Courts were, and are, invested with power to make partition, among heirs or devisees, of estates coming within their cognizance for settlement and distribution. 1 Washburn's Real Property, MT1BSk, . I, c. 13, § 7: Freeman's Cotenancy and Partition, § 550, 2d ed. The significance of this fact is not materially weakened by the circumstance that, generally, where the power of partition is or has been exercised in this country by Probate Courts, it has been by express authority of statutes which were not forbidden by constitutional provisions. The existence of such statutes, in many of the States, precludes the idea, so strongly pressed by plaintiffs' counsel, that, when the Constitution of California was adopted, partition was foreign to the probate system, as administered in this country. Such legislation, we suppose, has its origin in the belief that it is convenient, if not desirable, for all concerned in the estate of a decedent, that the same court, which supervises the final settlement of the accounts of a personal representative, and ascertains and declares the interests of heirs in such estate as may remain after the demands of creditors are satisfied, should have the power to make partition. We are not prepared to say that this belief is not well grounded. The connection between the administration, settlement, distribution, and partition of an estate is such, that the power to make partition may be justly regarded as ancillary to the power to distribute such estate, and, therefore, not alien to the probate system as it has long

OCTOBER TERM, 1888.
Opinion of the Court.
existed and now exists in many States. For the reasons stated, and in view of the recent decisions of the highest court of California, we do not feel at liberty to hold that the legislature could not constitutionally invest Probate Courts with jurisdiction to make partition of an undivided estate among the heirs at law of the deceased.
It is proper, in this connection, to say that there is nothing in -Ferrisv. Ligley, 20 Wall. 375, 382, upon which the plaintiffs rely, to show that partition is foreign to the probate systein as administered in this country. The decision there was, that, in view of the organic act of Utdih, which did not define the jurisdiction of the Probate Courts, and in view of the distribution by that act of judicial power among the various courts of that Territory, the jurisdiction of Probate Courts must be determined with reference to the general nature and character of the latter tribunals as recognized in our system of jurisprudence. An act of the territorial legislature, giving Probate Courts "original jurisdiction, both civil and criminal, and as well in chancery as at common law, when not prohibited by legislative enactment," was, therefore, held to be unconstitutional. So far from the doctrines of that case militating against the decision of the Supreme Court of California in Rosenberg v. Frank,it was said in"Ferris v. Higley to be the almost uniform rule among the people who make the common law of England the basis of their jurisprudence, to have a distinct tribunal for the establishment of wills and the administration of the estates of men dying either with or without wills- which tribunals are "variously called Prerogativ6 Courts, Probate Courts, Surrogate Courts, Orphans' Courts, &c.;" and that to these functions "have occasionally been added the guardianship of infants, and control of their property, the allotment of dower, and perhaps other powers related more or less to the same general subject."
It remains to consider whether the decree of partition is void upon grounds other than those relating to the constitutionality of the statute under which the Probate Court proceeded. The Circuit Court of the United States had no jurisdiction to set aside that decree, merely upon the ground of

ROBINSON v. FAIR.
Opinion of the Court.
error, nor could it refuse to give it full effect, unless the Probate Court was without jurisdiction of the case. Cooper v. Reynolds, 10 Wall. 308, 315; Gunn,v. Plant, 94 U. S. 664, 669 ; Hall v. Law, 102 U. S. 461, 464; .MJarchandv. Arelleen, 105 U. S. 423, 428. And in determining the question of jurisdiction, it must be remembered that Probate Courts of California have had for many years the rank of courts of general jurisdiction, and, as said in Burroughs v. De Coutq, 70 California, 361, 372, their proceedings, "within the jurisdiction conferred upon them by the law, are to be construed in the same manner and with the like intendments as the proceedings of courts of general jurisdiction, and their judgments have like force and effect as judgments of the District Courts." Probate Courts being, then, courts of superior jurisdiction, in respect to tlie settlement, distribution, and partition of estates coming within their cognizance, the recitals in the decree of partition unless contradicted by the record, will be presumed to be correct, and every intendment will be indulged in its support. Settlemier v. Svullivan, 97 U. S. 444, 449; Cheely v. Clayton, 110 U. S. 701, 708. With these preliminary observations as to the effect to be given to the decree and its recitals, where the decree is attacked in a collateral suit, we proceed to examine such of the objections to its validity as we deem of sufficient importance to notice.
1. It is contended that the administratrix, as such, had no interest in the partition of 'the decedent's estate, and could not, in that capacity, initiate proceedings therefor. Too much stress is laid upon the circumstance that the petition in the Probate Court was signed by M,rs. Hawes, as "admmistratrix." The petition seeks something more than a final settlement of her accounts, and a declaration of the interests of the heirs in the undistributed estate. It embraces also her claim as widow and heir, to a share in the estate remaining after the payment of debts and charges, and contains a distinct prayer that partition be had between herself and the children. It shows, as do the orders preceding the decree of partition, that she sought a settlement of her accounts as administratrix, and a final adjudication of her rights as heir at law in the estate re-

mailing in her hands. If it would have been better practice to have made partition the subject of a suit entirely separate from the proceeding for settlement and distribution, the blending of final settlement, distribution, and partition in the same petition, or in one suit, did not defeat the jurisdiction of the court or render its decree of partition void. The record shows that the question of partition was not considered or determined in the Probate Court until after it had made its decree of final settlement and distribution.
2. It is contended that proper notice was not given to the minor children of the proceedings in the Probate Court. This point is not sustained by the record of those proceedings. The decree of distribution recites that it appeared to the satisfaction of the court that due and sufficient notice of the time and place of hearing the petition had been duly given, as required by law, prior to the day set for hearing, and that the attorney appointed by the court to represent the minor children appeared at the hearing. It is also shown that this attorney was present at every step of the proceedings for partition. The decree for partition recites that it appeared to the satisfaction of the court that the commissioner appointed to make partition "gave notice to all parties interested, in all respects as prescribed by the statute in such cases." These recitals are not contradicted by anything in the record, unless it be that representation of the minor children in the proceedings for settlement, distribution, and partition, by an attorney appointed by the court, rather than by a guardian ad liten, was wholly inadequate to bring them into court. It is to be remembered that the Civil Code expressly provides, that notice of proceedings for partition may be "either personally or by public notice, as the Probate Court may direct," § 16,76; and if the account presented by the personal representative be one for final settlement, and the estate be ready for distribution, "on confirmation of the final account, distribution, and partition of the estate to all entitled thereto, may be immediately had, without further notice or proceedings." § 1634. It should also be observed that if the recitals, in the decrees of distribution and partition, of due notice, be open to dispute in

ROBINSON v. FAIR.
Opinion of the Court.
this collateral proceeding, it does not appear that the publication was not made, in all respects, as required by the order of court, and by the code.
In this connection it is insisted that the particular mode adopted in publishing notice of the proceedings for settlement, distribution, and partition, was not sufficient, in law, to give the court jurisdiction as to the children. This position is not tenable. The order to show cause why there should not be a final settlement and distribution, followed by a partition, according to the rights of the parties, was very full and explicit; and it was served in one of the modes by which, under the * local law, jurisdiction could be acquired. The mode adopted was by publication for "four successive weeks in such newspaper in the county as the court or judge shall direct." § 1539. *Pearson v. Pearson,46 California, 609, 635. The failure to repeat, in the order, the names of the minor children - whatever force that objection might have had upon a direct appeal from the decree of partition-is not a matter affecting the jurisdiction of the court over the subject-matter and the parties; for, the petition, and the order appointing an attorney to represent the minors, contained the names in full of all interested in the proceedings for settlement, distribution, and partition.
3. It is, h6wever, insisted that the defence for the minor children -who are not shown to have had, at the time, any general or special guardian in the county or State -could only have been conducted by a guardian, and that the appearance in their behalf by an attorney, appointed by the court to represent them, did not bring them into court. This position is
based upon §§ 372 and 373 of the. Code of Civil Procedure. But
those sections, in our opinion, have reference to civil actions as distinguished from "special proceedings." Code of Civil
Procedure, §§ 20 to 23 ; 372-3. A suit for partition, in a Pro-
bate Court, is a special proceeding, . Va trrnanv. Lawrenev, 19 California, 210, 218; and the section which controls the determination of this question is § 1718, part of Title XI, relating to "Proceedings in Probate Courts." That section, among other things, provides that "at or before the hearing of peti-

tions and contests for the probate of wills; for letters testamentary or of adminis--ration; for sales of real estate and confirmations thereof; settlements, partitions, and distributions of estates; setting apart homesteads; and all other proceedings where all the parties interested in the estate are required to be notified thereof, the court must appoint some competent attorney at law to represent, in all such proceedings, the devisees, legatees, heirs, or creditors of the decedent, who are minors and have no general guardian in the county, or who are non-residents of tho State; and may, if he deem it necessary, appoint an attorney to represent those interested, who though they are neither such minors or non-residents, are unrepresented. The order must specify the names of the parties for whom the attorney is appointed, who is thereby authorized to represent such parties in all such proceedings had subsequent to his appointment. The appearance of the attorney is sufficient proof of the service of the notice on the parties he is appointed to represent." We have not been able to find any provision requiring thE appointment of guardians ad ierm in probate proceedings. Without considering whether the failure to appoint a guardian ad litem for minors, where the statute requires it to be done, would vitiate the decree, and make it open to attack collaterally, it is sufficient to say that the appointment of an at':orney to represent the children in the' Probate Court was authorized by the statute.
These views are in conformity with the recent decision in Carenterv. Superior Court of San Joaguin County, decided April 21, 1888, and nDt yet reported. One of the questions there was as to the validity of certain proceedings .for the probate of a will, in which minor heirs were represented by an attorney, appointed by the court, and not by a guardian ad litem. Reliance was placed upon the section of the Civil Code, § 372, part of the title "Parties to Civil Actions," which provides that "when an infant is a party he must appear by his general guardian, if he has one; and if not, by a guardian who may be appointed by the court, in which the action is prosecuted, or by a judge thereof, or a county judge." It was held that probate proceedings were not civil actions within

the meaning of that title. The court said, "The thing which a guardian ad liten is appointed to do is, to ' represent' the infant in the action or proceeding, Code Civil Procedure § 372, by which we understand that he is to conduct and control the proceedings on behalf of the infant. Now the attorney for minors in probate proceedings is to 'represent' the minor, Code Civil Procedure § 1718, and so far as he is concerned, to conduct and control the proceedings; so that if the general provisions apply it would be possible to have two representatives of the minor in the same contest, neither of whom would be subordinate to the other. We do not think that such a result could have been intended."
There are no other questions in the case which we deem it necessary to discuss. We find no error in the judgment below, and it is

KANE v. NORTHERN CENTRAL RAILWAY COMPANY.
ERROR TO THE OnOUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA.
No. 8. Submitted October 12, 188.-Decided October 22, IMS.
In an action by an employ6 of a railroad company against the company to recover damages for personal injuries received by reason of the negligence of the company, in order to determine whether the employ6, by recklessly exposing himself to peril, has failed to exercise the care for his personal safety that might reasonably be expected, and has thus by his own negligence contributed to causing the accident, regard must always be had to the circumstances of the case, and the exigencies of his position; and the decision of this question ought not to be withheld from the jury unless the evidence, after giving the plaintiff the benefit of every inference to be fairly drawn from it, so conclusively establishes contributory negligence, that the Court would be compelled,.in the exercise of a sound judicial discretion, to set aside any verdict returned in his favor.
