answer; that it could not be presumed that under such circumstances any Federal prosecution would ever take place, and that it was, within the reasoning of Brown v. Walker, supra, a danger so unsubstantial and remote that it was not necessary (as it was impossible) for the statute to provide against it. We regard this as a sound view. We do not believe that in such case there is any real danger of a Federal prosecution, or that such evidence would be availed of by the Government for such purpose. We think the legal' immunity is in regard to a prosecution in the same jurisdiction, and when that is fully given it is enough. The principles underlying the provision itself have been thoroughly treated in the above cited cases, and it would be out of place to here renew their discussion.
We are of opinion that no Federal right of the plaintiff in error has been violated, and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Kansas must, therefore, be
Affirmed.

McCUNE v. ESSIG.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT.
No. 61. Submitted November 9, 1905.-Decided November 29, 1905.
The interest which arises in an entryman by his entry, who can fulfil the conditions of settlement and proof in case of his death, and to whom the title passes depend upon the laws of. the United States; and a suit brought by an heir, claiming under the law of a State, against the grantee of the widow who perfected title and obtained the patent involves the construction of sections 2291 and 2292, Rev. Stat,, and other statutes relating to homesteads, and can be removed on that ground from the state court to the Circuit Court of the United States.
Under sections 2291 and 2292, Rev. Stat., the widow of the entryman is

Argument for Appellant.

first entitled to complete the entry and obtain a patent, and a state law is not competent to change this provision and give the children of the entryman an interest paramount to that of the widow.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.

Mr. W. E. Cullen for appellant: 'If this court has jurisdiction of this case, then it must determine all cases where the United States was the grantor, and a controversy arises as to beneficial interests. It has not been the policy of this court to determine questions involving the beneficial or equitable title to real estate, although the title had been acquired from the United States. Blackburn v. Portland Gold Mining Co., 175 U. S. 571. As to the laws of Washington making this land community property, see §§ 4488-4491, 4621 Balling~r's Code; Forker v. Henry, 21 Washington, 235, 240; Ahern v. Ahern, 31 Washington, 334. Beyond doubt, the widow took the legal title under'and by virtue of the patent. The patent operated as a release to the widow of all the interest of the United States in the land. Whether she took the beneficial interest as well as the legal title depends.upon the effect to be given the acts of the legislature of the State, and not upon th6 acts of Congress. Romie V. Casanova,"91 U. S. 379; McStay v. Friedman, 92 U. S. 723; Hoadley v. San Francisco,94 U. S. 4; Blue Bird Mining Co. v. Largey, 49 Fed. Rep. 289; Shoshone Mining Co. v. Rutter, 177 U. S. 505. This is not inconsistent with the proposition that after the title so passed, and vested it became subject to the community
and other property laws of the State. After any part of the public domain has been entered, and
notice has been properly filed, the land so entered becomes
segregated from the public domain, and the settler has a vested right therein against everybody, and the Government as well, and when the patent for such land is issued it relates back and takes effecf as of the time of such entry. 1 Supp. Rev. Stat."

The laws, the construction of which appellees claim are involved in this case, simply provide the manner in which a .pat-, ent may be obtained. In Bernier v. Bernier, 147 U. S. 242, and Hutchinson Co. v. Caldwell, 152 U. S. 65, there was no question of state statutes.
Under the doctrine of relation, a patent for a preemption takes effect from the time of settlement. Section 3 of the act of May 14, 1880, 21 Stat. 140, provides that patent for homesteads'.kshall relate back to,the settlement the same as in preemption. Cases supra and Gibson v. Choteau, 13 Wall. 92.
If the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals is correct there can be no such thing as community property in land acquired by patent and the patentee can convey without the wife, or husband, as the case may be, joining in the conveyance as required by the laws of the State of Washington.
If this court has jurisdiction it will be bound by the rule laid down in the state court, as determinative of the rule in the State, that when title is initiated during the community and perfected after dissolution the property is community. Lowndes v. Huntington, 153 U. S.1; United States v. Fox, 94 U. S.315; Arndt v. Griggs, 134 U. S. 321; Investment Co. v. Caldwell, 152 U. S.65. Hall v. Russell, 101 U. S.503 does not
apply to this case.

Mr. George Turner, Mr. F. H. Graves and Mr. W. G. Graves
for appellees: Prior to patent, or, at least, prior to a full compliance with
the conditions which entitld him to a patent, the settler has no more than a right of possession and a right to be preferred in

the purchase of the lands. As against the United States, the owner of the lands, he acquires no vested right until he has fully complied with the requirements of the act, and Congress may at any time vest title in another. Shiver v. United States, 159 U. S. 491; Campbell v. Wade, 132 U. S. 34; Wagstaf v. Collins, 97 Fed. Rep. 3; Frisbie v. Whitney, 9 Wall. 187; Shepley v. Cowan, 91 U. S. 330; Gonzales v. French, 164 U. S.338,
345' No doubt this right is, in a sense, a property right. But
it is held at the will of Congress; it may be forfeited for noncompliance with existing laws, or taken away by changes in those laws. It therefore becomes subject to state regulation only in so, far as Congress permits. Anderson v. Carkins, 135 U. S.483; Hall v. Russell, 101 U. S. 503, 513, 514.
Section 2291, Rev. Stat. is not a statute providing for the descent of property. Where a settler upon the public lands dies prior to completing the necessary period of residence, those who succeed to his right acquire it not. by descent from him, but as direct donees from the United States. Hall v. Russell, 101 U. S.503; Maynard v. Hill, 125 U. S.190, 215; CUtting v. Cutting, 6 Fed. Rep. 259; Stubblefield v. Manzies, 11 Fed. Rep. 270; United States v. Tichenor, 12 Fed. Rep. 421; Hershberger v. Blewett, 55 Fed. Rep. 177; Cooper v. Wilder, 111 California, 195; Wittenbrock v. Wheaton, 60 Pac. Rep. 664.
The right of a settler is a personal one and those designated by Congress to succeed to the right take as original grantees and not through him, and therefore the right is not amenable to the laws of the State where the land is situated when the settler dies. Cases cited supra; Towner v. Rodegeb, 33. Washington, 153; Rogers v. Clemans, 26 Kansas, 552; Dawson v. Mayall, 45 Minnesota, 408; Cooper v. Wilder, 111 California, 195; Gjerstadegen v.

MR. JUSTICE McKENNA delivered the opinion of the court.

Suit in equity to establish title in appellant to an undivided one-half of northwest quarter of section 6, township 25 north, range 30 east, Washington meridian 2, and for accounting of rents and profits and for partition between appellant and appellees.
It was originally brought in the Superior Court in and for Lincoln County in the State of Washington. A demurrer was filed to the amended complaint and a petition to remove the suit to the Circuit Court for the District of Washington, Eastern Division, on the ground- that the suit involved the construction of sections 2291 and 2292 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, and of all statutes of the United States relating to homesteads. The suit was removed. In the Circuit Court a motion was made to remand, which was denied. The demurrer was sustained, and appellant, electing to stand upon her bill, it was decreed that she had no right, title or interest in the land. 1 118 Fed. Rep. 273. The decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 122 Fed. Rep. 588.
The facts as exhibited by the bill of complaint are that appellant is the daughter of William McCune, deceased, and his wife, Sarah MeCune, now Sarah Donahue, and the stepdaughter of Daniel Donahue, who appears as her guardian ad litem. William McCuno and his wife .Sarah settled on the land in controversy, it being a part of the public domain and subject to settlement under the homestead laws. On the fourth of April, 1884, McCune filed a claim to the land as a homestead in the proper land district. In the same year he died intestate,

McCUNE v. ESSIG.

leaving surviving as his only heirs appellant and his wife Sarah. They continued to reside on the land until December 17, 1889, upon which day the mother of appellant made the required proof of full compliance with the homestead laws, and on the sixth of March, 1891, a patent was issued to her. In the year 1892 she, having become Mrs. Donahue, sold and conveyed the land to appellees, who went into possession of it and have been in possession of it ever since. The value of the land i sixty-four hundred dollars. The patent recites:
"'Whereas there has been deposited in the General Land Office of -the United States a certificate of the register of the land office at Spokane Falls, Washington, it appears that pursuant to the act of Congress approved May 20., 1862, 'to secure homesteads to actual settlers on the public domain, and the acts supplemental thereto, the claim of Sarah Donahue, formerly the Widow of William McCune, deceased, has been established and duly consummated, in conformity to law, for the south half of the northeast quarter and the lots numbered one and two of section six, in township twenty-five norti of range thirty-eight of Willamette meridian in Washington, containing one hundred and sixty-three and eighty-four hundredths of an acre, according to the official plat of the survey of the said land, returned to the General Land Office by the
surveyor general: "Now know ye, that there is, therefore, granted by the
United States unto the said Sarah Donahue the tract of land above described, to have and to hold the said tract of land, with the appurtenances thereof, unto the said Sarah Donahue and to her heirs and assigns forever."
The action 'f the lower courts on the motion to remand and on the merits are attacked by appellant to a certain extent on the same ground, to wit, that the laws of Washington determine the title 'of the parties, not the laws of the United States. The interest in McCune, acquired by his entry, it is contended, was community property, and passed to appellant under the laws of the State. Sections 4488, 4489, 4490 and

OCTOBER TERM, 1905.

Opinion of the Court.

199 U. S.

4491 of the statutes of Washington provide that property and pecuniary rights owned by either husband or wife before marriage, or that acquired afterwards by gifts, bequests, devise or descent, shall be separate property. Property not so acquired or owned shall be community property, and, in the absence of testamentary disposition by a deceased husband or wife, shall descend equally to the legitimate issue of his or their bodies. 1 Ballinger's Codes. Relying on these provisions the argument of appellant is, and we give it in the words of her counsel:
"When William McCune entered this land ie had not the legal title, but he had an immediate equitable interest and the exclusive - right: of possession until forfeited by failure to carry out the terms of his entry. United States v. Turner,
54 Fed. Rep. 228. "The terms of his entry were carried out. The patent issued
by reason of his entry. The state legislature had the right to direct to whom that equitable right and interest should pass. If the rights and interests under that entry had been forfeited, the state law would have no effect ,upon the title to the land. That equitable interest ripened, and was confirmed
by the patent." But this is begging the question. What interest arose in
McCune by his entry, who could upon his death fulfil the conditions of settlement and proof, and to whom and for whom title would pass, depended upon the laws of the United States. Bernier v. Bernier, 147 U. S. 242. The motion to remand was rightly overruled. On the merits we think the ruling of the lower courts was also right. Hutchinson Investment Co. v. Caldwell, 152 U. S. 65. Hoadley v. San Francisco, 94 U. S. 4, and other cases relied on by appellant, are not in point.
Chapter five, Title XXXII, of the Revised Statutes provides who may enter public lands as a homestead and the conditions to be observed as to entry and settlement. By sections 2291 and 2292 it is provided as follows:
"SEC.. 2291. No certificate, however, shall be given, or patent

issued therefor, until the expiration of five years from the date

of such entry; and if at the expiration of such time, or at any

time within two years thereafter, the person making such

entry; or if he be dead, his widow; or in case of her death, his

heirs or devisee; or in case of a widow making such entry, her

heirs or devisee, in case of her death, proves by two credible

witnesses that he, she, or they have resided upon or cultivated

the same for the term of five years immediately succeeding the

time of filing the affidavit, and makes affidavit that no part of

such land had been alienated, except as provided in section twenty-two hundred and eighty-eight, and that he, she, or

they will bear true allegiance to the Government of the United States; then, in such case, he, she, or they, if at that time citi-

zens of the United States,' shall be entitled to a patent as in

other cases provided by law.

"SEC. 2292.

. In case of the death of both father

and mother, leaving an infant child or children under twenty-

one years of age, the right and fee shall inure to the benefit of

such infant child or children.

It requires an exercise of ingenuity to establish uncertainty

in these provisions. They say who shall enter and what he

shall do to complete title to the right thus acquired. He may reside upon and cultivate the land, and by doing so is entitled

to a patent. If he die his widow is given the right of residence

and cultivation, and "shall be entitled to a patent as in other

cases." He can make no devolution of the land against her.

The statute which gives him a right gives her a right. She is

as much a beneficiary of the statute as he. The words of the statute are clear, and express who in turn shall be its bene-

ficiaries. The contention of appellant reverses the order of the

statute and gives the children an interest paramount to that

of the widow through the laws of the State.

The law of the State is not competent to do this. As was

observed by Circuit Judge Gilbert: "The law of the State of

Washington governs the descent of land lying within the

State, but the question here is whether there had been any

Opinion of the Court.

199 U. S.

descent of land." And, against application of the state law, the learned judge cited Wilcox v. Jackson, 13 Pet. 498, 517, and Bernier v. Bernier, supra. In the former it was said that whenever the question is whether title to land which had been the property of the United States has passed, that questioiimust be resolved by the laws of the United States, but that whenever, according to those laws, the title shall have passed, then, like all other property in the State, it is subject to state legislation. In Beanier v. Bernier it was said that the object of sections 2291 and-2292 was "to provide the method of completing the-homestead claim and obtaining a patent therefor, and not to establish a line of descent or rules of distribution of the deceased entryman's estate." See Hall v. Russell, 101
U. S. 503. And hence it was decided thht Mrs. Donahue took the title free from any interest or right in the appellant under the'laws of the State.
Against the effect of the patent conveying title to Mrs. Donahue,'. appellant invokes the doctrine of relation. It is admitted "that the title to the real estate in the case at bar passed and. vested according to the laws of the United States by patent." But,. it is contended, that a beneficial interest having. been created by the state law in McCune when the title passed opat of the United States by the patent, it "instantly dropped back in time to the inception or initiation of the equitable right of William McCune, and that the laws of the., State intercepted and. prevented the widow from having a complete, titlec w hout first complying with the probate laws of the State." This, however, is but another way of asserting
the law oP the State against the law of the United States, and imposing a limitatio'n upon the title of the widow which section 2291_ of the Revised Statutes does not impose. It may be that appellant's contention has support in some expressions in the state decisions. If, however, they may be construed as going to the extent contended for, we are unable to accept them as controlling.
Decree affirmed.

such an instrumentality of government as prevents its taxation by or under state authority. Congress has not constituted this corporation an agency of its own for the purpose of discharging any duties which the Government may owe to the Indians. It has, as the complaint avers, made in the past some appropriations from time to time to the corporation to aid it in its own work among the Indians, but that is far from constituting the
corporation an agency of its own, to carry into effect its own governmental powers, granted by the Constitution or by law. And even such appropriations ceased years ago.
The case, in short, is one of that class where we have frequently held that the claim of a Federal question must have some foundation of plausibility, St. Joseph &c. R. R. v. Steele, 167 U. S. 659; McCainv. Des Moines, 174 U. S. 168, in order to give jurisdiction. This has none.

SPEER v. COLBERT.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
No. 153. Argued December 13, 14, 1905.-Decided January 2, 1906.
Institutions incorporated under special acts of Congress take their character from the act incorporating them and bequests to Georgetown College and other institutions in the District of Columbia under a will made within thirty days of the death of the testator held not void, under § 34 of the Maryland Bill of Rights, as the legatees are not sectarian institutions under any of the acts incorporating them.
There being no institution incorporated as Georgetown University separate from Georgetown College, and as it was evident that the testator intended not to leave the property to an unincorporated institution but to an

incorporated one, able to take the bequest, Georgetown College was entitled thereto. The franchise of a corporation is not taken away or surrendered, nor is the
corporation dissolved, by the mere failure to elect trustees. It is within the powers of an institution intended for the instruction of
youth in the liberal arts and sciences to take and use a fund for the cultivation of historical research. The trusts in this will were not such as could be defeated by the death or
resignation of the trustees although the will made it their duty to supervise the administration of the fund. Courts will not hold a bequest void for uncertainty unless actually compelled to do so by the language used, and a bequest of a sum not to exceed a specified amount, if otherwise valid, will be taken to be a bequest of that amount. It is not an illegal placing of discretion in trustees to empower them to establish a scholarship with a bequest not exceeding a specified sum in "some medical college preferably Georgetown University in the District."

ONE of the appellants, Mrs. Speer, on the fifth of March, 1901, filed this bill in her own behalf and by her husband and next friend, Emory Speer, in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia to obtain a judicial construction of the will of her deceased brother, Ethelbert Carroll Morgan, who died, testate, on May 5, 1891, a resident of the District of Columbia. Answers to the bill were duly filed and the Supreme Court gave judgment construing the will, which, upon appeal to the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, was reversed, and judgment was entered, construing the will, by the Court of Appeals. From that judgment Mrs. Speer, together with some of the parties defendant in the suit, appealed, and brought the case here for review.
The will in question was executed on the twenty-second day of April, 1891, and the testator died May 5, 1891. He was never married, and left as his next of kin and heirs at law two brothers and three sisters, viz: James D. and Cecil Morgan, and Mrs. Speer, the plaintiff in this suit, and Mrs. Anna M. Mosher and Mrs. Ada M. Hill. He appointed William J. Stephenson and John H. Magruder the executors and trustees of his will, the former of whom subsequently died and the

latter resigned, and Michael J. Colbert and James Mosher were duly appointed by the court as substituted trustees under the will. The estate of the testator was treated by him in his will as consisting of two parts, that which he had himself accumulated and that which came to him through the will of his father, who died in June, 1889. His own accumulations amounted to a little over twenty-three thousand dollars, while the estate which he received from his father somewhat exceeded fifty-five thousand dollars, the total being a trifle over seventy-eight thousand dollars. The estate of the deceased had been received by the substituted trustees, Colbert and Mosher, when this bill was filed by Mrs. Speer against them, and also against Mrs. Anna M. Mosher, the wife of James Mosher, and a sister of the testator, and also against the two corporations incorporated as St. Vincent's Orphan Asylum and as Trustees of St. Joseph's Male Orphan Asylum, both being in the District of Columbia, who were made parties because, as the plaintiff alleges in her bill, they claim to be the beneficiaries under the clauses of the wUll of the testator, leaving a legacy to be equally divided between St. Vincent's and St. Joseph's Catholic Orphan Asylums in the city of Washington, and in order that they might make proof of their identity, if any existed, with the St. Vincent, and also with the St. Joseph Catholic Orphan Asylums, mentioned in the will, and that they might be bound by the adjudication which might be made by the court in all respects hereafter; and also
against John D. Whitney, James P. Fagan, Edward McTammany, James B. Becker and Edward 1. Devitt, who, the plaintiff alleged, claimed to be, by succession, the President and Directors of Georgetown College, and who, as such, claimed an interest in the estate of the testator, under the clauses of his will mentioning Georgetown University, in the District of Columbia, and the plaintiff alleged that they were made defendants in order that they might make proof of succession to the original incorporators of Georgetown College, and that their claims to the legacy mentioned in the will might be

adjudicated by the court. The bill alleged that the will of the testator was duly admitted to probate in the proper court in the District of Columbia. After making certain provisions, not here material, the will of the testator is as follows:
"All the rest and residue of my estate real, personal and mixed of which I am now possessed or shall possess at my death (other than my share under my father's will of which I would become possessed at my mother's death) I give bequeath and devise to my trustees hereinafter named and their heirs and assigns with full power to sell convey mort-

"And if my said two sisters shall both die leaving no issue living at their deaths I direct my said trustees to deliver and convey all the said rest and remainder of my estate (excepting my share aforesaid under my father's will) to Georgetown University in the District of Columbia to be an endowment in equal shares of the literary and medical departments thereof."

and declared this as my will this 22nd day of April, 1891." The plaintiff alleged that the bequest and devise to George-
town University, upon the death of the two sisters, without issue living at the time of their death, were void, because, as alleged, there was no such incorporated institution in the District of Columbia as Georgetown University, capable of taking the bequest and devise, and also upon the ground that, assuming there was a simple misnomer, and that Georgetown College was meant instead of Georgetown University, yet, even upon that assumption, Georgetown College was incapable of taking the devise and bequest, because it was under the supervision and control of the Order of Jesuits, and that the college was therefore a sectarian institution. It was also averred that the bequest of $10,000 to Georgetown University in the District of Columbia, to be used and held as an endowment for the prosecution of research in the colonial history of Maryland and the territory now embraced in the District of Columbia, "was void, upon the same ground, and also because there was no charter power or authority in Georgetown College (assuming that institution to be meant) to receive the bequest." Also that the bequest of a sum not to exceed the amount of $5,000, to be applied and expended under the personal supervision of the trustees, for the purchase and erection of a chime of bells, etc., was void, as was also the alternative bequest of an amount not to exceed that sum for

the benefit of the two Catholic orphan asylums, in the city of Washington, the alternative bequest being void on the ground that those asylums were under the charge and control of persons belonging to religious orders, and therefore incapable of taking the bequest, and on the further ground that the amount of the bequest was uncertain. The bill averred also that the remaining bequest, of a sum not to exceed $3,000, and also the bequest of 85,000, for the purpose of maintaining and founding scholarships, etc., were void, because of their uncertainty and the want of clearly defined conditions under which the funds should be applied.

Whitney and others, for and on behalf of the president and directors of Georgetown College, and also the trustees of St. Joseph's Male Orphan Asylum and of St. Vincent's Orphan Asylum, all claimed the validity of the bequests contained in the will, while the answer of Mosher, the other substituted trustee, simply expressed his willingness that the provisions of the will of the testator should be given effect and carried out, only so far as they were legal and valid.
On the trial, proof was taken in regard to the name and corporate status of Georgetown College, claiming the devises and bequests made to and on behalf of Georgetown University.
The Supreme Court, in an elaborate opinion (reported in 31 Washington Law Reporter, 630, 646), held that the devises and bequests to trustees named in the will, of the testator's estate, exclusive of that which came to him under the will of his father, were valid and effectual. The court also held that all the clauses and subelauses in the will of the testator, disposing of property acquired by the testator under his father's will, were void, and that the property therein spoken of became part of the residuum of the estate of the testator, and vested in the beneficiaries entitled to take under the residuary clause of the will. The Court of Appeals, upon re-

view of this judgment, held that the clauses of the will were valid, except the bequest of "a sum not to exceed five thousand dollars," to be expended under the personal supervision of the trustees in the purchase and erection of a chime of bells, and the erection of an altar or memorial window, etc.; but the alternative bequest of the sum not to exceed five thousand dollars, to be equally divided between St. Vincent and St. Joseph's Orphan Asylums in the city of Washington, was good. It also held that the clause in the will, providing for the application of five thousand dollars to form a fund to be known as the E. Carroll Morgan fund or scholarship, to be applied as "I [the testator] may hereafter verbally indicate to my trustees or if I fail, as my trustees with the advice of pioper persons may decide, to the maintenance of a scientific dcpartment, or the foundation and the application of the income to a scholarship in the classical department in the University of Georgetown in the District of Columbia," was void. No appeal has been taken from this last portion of the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

The bequest of $10,000 for endowing the James Ethelbert Morgan fund for prosecution and research in colonial history is void.

Even though the money is directed to be paid over to Georgetown University, and if that be considered as a charitable institution (which it is not), still if the purpose to which it is to be applied is not charitable within the meaning of the rule, and that purpose fails for want of a designated beneficiary capable of applying to a court of equity to enforce the trust the bequest must fail.

The alternate bequest to the two asylums is also void. Whenever a power is of a kind that indicates a personal confidence it must primafack be understood to be confined to the individual to whom it is given, and will not except by express words pass to others to whom by legal transmission the same character may belong. Cole v. Wade, 16 Ves. Jr. 27; Alexander v. Alexander, 2 Yes. Sr. 643; Powles v. Jordan, 62 Maryland, 503; Atty. General v. Berryman, 1 Dickens, 168; Fontain v. Ravenal, 17 How. 369, 382.
The charters of these two asylums are in evidence and show that they organized as private charitable and educational institutions, hence the bequests are void under §34 of the Bill
of Rights. The legacy for scholarship is void because indefinite and
the discretion reposed in the executors expired with the death of one and the resignation of the other. Cases spra. The death of trustees given by will power to select the beneficiary of a charitable bequest from several uncertain classes defeats the bequest if valid in the first instance. Cases supra.

Mr. George E. Hamilton and Mr. M. J. Colbert for appellee.

MR. JUSTICE PECKHAM, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court.

The opinion of the Court of Appeals, in this case, delivered by Chief Justice Alvey (24 App. D. C. 187), is entirely satisfactory to us, and leaves little to be said in addition. For

SPEER v. COLBERT.

200 U.S.

Opinion of the Court.

the purpose, however, of simply stating the opinion of this court upon the various questions, without discussing them at length, we add what follows.
The appellants insist that the gift of the property to the Georgetown University is void, as having been made to a sectarian institution less than one calendar month prior to the testator's death, and that such disposition was therefore in violation of section 457 of the Revised Statutes of the District of Columbia. That section makes valid and effectual all sales, gifts and devises prohibited by the thirty-fourth section of the Declaration of Rights of the State of Maryland, adopted in 1776, "provided, that in case of gifts and devises, the same shall be made at least one calendar month before the death of the donor or testator." 14 Stat. 232; passed July 25, 1866. The thirty-fourth section of the Maryland Bill of Rights makes void:
"Every gift, sale or devise of lands to any minister, public teacher or preacher of the gospel as such, or to any religious sect, order or denomination, or to or for the support, use or benefit of or in trust for any minister, public teacher or preacher
of the gospel as such, or any religious sect, order or denomination; every gift or sale of goods or chattels to go in succession or take place after the death of the seller or donor, to or for such support, use or benefit, and also every devise of goods or chattels to or for support, use or benefit of any minister, public teacher or preacher of the gospel as such, or any religious sect, order or denomination, without leave of the legis-
lature." It is also insisted that there is a misnomer of the corporation,
now claiming the right to the bequest, inasmuchas such corporation was incorporated under the name of the "The President and Directors of Georgetown College," while the bequest is to "Georgetown University, in the District of Columbia." It is contended that Georgetown College is a corporation, incorporated on the tenth of June, 1844, under an act of Congress (6 Stat. 912, entitled "An act to incorporate George-

OCTOBER TERM, 1905.

Opinion of the Court.

town College, in the District of Columbia"), and that there was and is another institution in Georgetown, sometimes called the University of Georgetown or Georgetown University, which was distinct from the college incorporated under the above-mentioned act of Congress, and not covered by it, and that the testator knew of this so-called university, that he was a professor therein, and that such university was, at the time of the testator's death, a sectarian institution within the thirty-fourth section of the Maryland Bill of Rights above mentioned. The fourth section of the above act expressly provides that no misnomer of the corporation shall defeat or annul any donation, etc., to the corporation. We agree with the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia in the opinion that there was not, at the time of the execution of his will by the testator, or at the time of his death, any incorporated institution existing as Georgetown University or University of Georgetown, separate and apart from, or having powers other than, those granted to "The President and Directors of Georgetown College," by the act of Congress of 1844, above cited. It appears in the evidence that this college was frequently spoken of as Georgetown University, and known as such, but the evidence entirely fails to show that there were two incorporated institutions, the one, "Georgetown University," and the other "The President and Directors of Georgetown College." And we have no doubt that the testator meant the corporation called Georgetown College when he used in his will the word university. He meant to give the property to a corporation, and to one that could take it, and the evidence shows there was no other corporation of that kind. Upon this question the Court of Appeals said: "It was expressly alleged in the bill as a fact that there is no such incorporated institution as Georgetown University, though Georgetown College is frequently referred to
and spoken of as Georgetown University, notwithstanding it has never been incorporated as such. It is simply a popular designation applied to the college. It is alleged in the bill

SPEER v. COLBERT.

200 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

that the defendants Whitney and others, under the name of president and directors of Georgetown College, in this District, claim to be the beneficiaries entitled to the legacies mentioned in the will of the testator as for Georgetown University. It is not attempted to be shown that there was, or is, in this District any such incorporated institution of learning as "Georgetown University," separate from and independent of "Georgetown College." It was not to any unincorporated so-called institution that the testator intended to leave the property, but to one that was incorporated and capable of taking a legacy.
Various acts of the legislature of Maryland were referred to on the argument, particularly the act of 1792, chapter 55; that of 1797, chapter 40; the act of 1805, chapter 118; that of 1808, chapter 37; also the act of Congress of March 1, 1815, chapter 70, 6 Stat. 152, entitled "An act concerning the College of Georgetown, in the District of Columbia"; also that of March 2, 1833, 6 Stat. 538, in which the Government grants certain lots in Washington city to the college above referred to. These various statutes were cited for the purpose of showing the validity of the claim that an institution called Georgetown University, as distinct from Georgetown College, was meant in the will of the testator. In regard to these particular acts we think thay do not bear upon the case other than, as remarked by the Court of Appeals, to show the origin and growth of Georgetown College, and to identify the early foundation of the school with the president and directors of Georgetown College, as that institution was fully and completely incorporated by the above-cited act of Congress of March 10, 1844. That act must be resorted to as the measure of the powers and duties, as well as to define the character, of the corporation created thereby. Bradfield v. Roberts, 175 U. S. 291.
Taking the character of the college from the act of Congress, we are of opinion that it is not a sectarian institution or within section 34 of the Maryland Bill of Rights. The reasoning upon

OCTOBER TERM, 1905.

Opinion of the Court.

200 U. S.

this subject (as well as that upon the alleged misnomer of the college) set forth in the opinion of the Supreme Court (31 Washington Law Reporter, 630), and in that of the Court of Appeals, is entirely satisfactory, and we concur therein.
There is, in our judgment, no merit in the contention that the persons claiming as president and directors of the college are not the legal successors of the original incorporation. There is no evidence that the same has been dissolved. The franchise of a corporation is not taken away or surrendered, nor is the corporation dissolved by the mere failure to elect trustees. We do not think that in this case there was any failure to elect, nor was there any dissolution.
We now come to the consideration of the validity of the disposition made of the testator's property, which came to him from the will of his father. The testator gives and bequeaths all of that property to his trustees, thereafter named, in the will, and their heirs and assigns forever, "with full power to sell, convey, mortgage, incumber and reinvest, in trust nevertheless to pay and see to the application of: First, the slum of ($10,000) ten thousand dollars to Georgetownm University in the District of Columbia, to be used and held as an endowment, for the prosecution of research in the colonial history of Maryland and the territory now embraced in the District of Columbia, and obtaining and preserving archives and papers having relation thereto, and known as the James Ethelbert Morgan fund."
Aside from the objections to the bequest to Georgetown University already considered, a further objection is made, and the disposition is alleged to be void, because there is no charter power in any institution which could take under this bequest that authorizes it to prosecute such research and obtain and preserve the archives relating thereto. It is well said, in the opinion of the Court of Appeals in this case, that the act of incorporation of Georgetown- College in 1844 confers "corporate power upon the institution for the instruction of youth in the liberal arts and sciences, and also clothes the corporation

SPEER v. COLBERT.

200 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

with power to take any estate whatsoever, in any lands, etc., or goods, chattels, moneys and other effects, by gift, bequest, devise, etc., and the same to grant, convey or assign, and to place out on interest for the use of said college and to apply the same. The cultivation of historical research would seem to be a part of a liberal education, such as should be encouraged by a college intended to confer degrees upon students in acquiring a liberal education in the arts and sciences." In Jones v. Habersham, 107 U. S. 174, 189, it is said that "A corporation may hold and execute a trust for charitable objects in accord with or tending to promote the purposes of its creation, although such as it might not by its charter or by general laws, have authority itself to establish or to spend its corporate funds for. A city, for instance, may take a devise in trust to maintain a college, an orphan school or an asylum."
Although it is, under the will, the duty of the trustees therein named to exercise supervision over the administration of the fund, nevertheless the death or resignation of the trustees named in the will cannot, and does not, defeat the bequest. There is not such a personal trust as renders it necessary to have the personal action of the trustee named in the will, and the trust does not fail upon the death or resignation of the named trustee. The court may appoint his successor. Inglis v. Trustees of Sailors' Snug Harbor, 3 Pet. 99, etc.
Both courts below have held that the bequest of a sum not to exceed five thousand dollars, to be expended under the personal supervision of the trustees in the purchase and erection of a chime of bells, etc., to be void. We agree with those courts in that respect. We also agree with the views of the Court of Appeals, holding that the alternative bequest of this same stun, not to exceed five thousand dollars, to be divided equally between the two orphan asylums, is valid. There is no material misnomer in either case, although they are in-
corporated institutions, one by the name of St. Vincent's Orphan Asylum and the other as St. Joseph's Male Orphan Asylum in the city of Washington, and they are referred to in
VOL. ce-lO

OCTOBER TERM, 1905.

200 U. S.

the will simply as St. Vincent's Orphan Asylum and St. Joseph's Catholic Orphan Asylum.
Nor does the bequest violate the thirty-fourth section of the Maryland Bill of Rights, already referred to. The same reasoning on that point governs this bequest as is applicable to the bequest to the University of Georgetown. Neither of
these orphan asylums is a sectarian institution under the acts of incorporation. The other objection made is that the clause directs that a sum, not exceeding five thousand dollars, shall be equally divided between these orphan asylums; and it is said that there is such uncertainty in the amount of the bequest as to render it impossible to execute it, that it might be fulfilled by dividing a dollar between the asylums, or any other sum, within the five thousand dollars named in the bequest. But it seems to us that the intention of the testator is clear to give the full sum of, but not to exceed, five thousand dollars. That is, he gives five thousand dollars to be equally divided between these two asylums. While the amount is not to exceed five thousand dollars, the direction for an equal division, taken in connection with the other facts, render it in our opinion clear that the intention of the testator was that that sum should be the amount of the bequest. Courts are always reluctant to hold a bequest void for uncertainty, and they only do it when actually compelled to do so by the language used. Inglis v. Trustees of Sailors' Snug Harbor, 3 Pet. supra. If the testator had really intended that any less sum than five thousand dollars should be disposed of by and
equally divided under this clause in his will, he would have said so.
Objection is also made to the bequest of "a sufficient sum, not to exceed three thousand ($3,000) dollars, the income to be applied to maintain a scholarship in the study of medicine, preferably in Georgetown University; otherwise in some medical college in the District, to be known as the E. Carroll Morgan scholarship." The first objection, as to the uncertainty of the amount of the bequest, we do not regard as meritorious.

SPEER v. COLBERT.

200 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

It is a sum sufficient to found a scholarship, and it shall not

exceed, in any event, $3,000. If one can be founded, within

the conditions named in the will, for a less sum than $3,000,

then that less sum only can be used. The discretion to be

exercised by the trustees in selecting the college with which

to connect the scholarship does not render the bequest void.

The testator has, by this clause in his will, himself expressed

his preference for Georgetown College, if the scholarship can

be maintained in that institution, but if not, it is to be a

scholarship in some medical college of the District. This,

we think, is not an improper or uncertain disposition of the

bequest, or an illegal placing of a discretion in the trustees

under the will. See Attorney Gerwral v. Gleg, 1 Atk. 356;

Attorney General v. Fletcher, 5 L. J. Eq. (N. S.) 75; 2 Perry

on Trusts, 4th ed., § 721.

The last bequest objected to is that of five thousand dollars,

to form a fund known as the E. Carroll Morgan fund or scholar-

ship, to be applied as the testator might thereafter indicate

to his trustees, etc. This has been declared void by both

courts, and no appeal has been taken from the judgment of

the Court of Appeals adjudging that item to be void. That

bequest being adjudicated invalid, the fund provided for therein

forms part of the residue of the testator's estate, and passes

under the residuary clause of the will.

These views call for an affirmance of the judgment of the

Court of Appeals, with costs to the several parties, to be paid

out of the residuary fund, as provided for by the judgment

of that court.

CAMPBELL v. CALIFORNIA. Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

CAMPBELL v. CALIFORNIA.
ERROR TO THE SUPREMWE COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.
No. 70. Argued November 27, 23, 105W.-Deeided January 2, 1900.
The California inheritance tax law of 1893, as amended in 1899, which imposed a tax on inheritances of and bequests to brothers and sisters, and not on those of daughters-in-law or sons-in-law, was assailed as repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment, and having been sustained by the highest court of the State, a writ of error from this court was prosecuted. After the record was filed a new inheritance tax law was enacted in 1905, which amended and reenacted prior laws on the subject and also repealed the acts of 1893 and 1899 without any clause saving the right of the State in respect to charges already accrued thereunder. Plaintiff in error contended that as this court had jurisdiction on the constitutional question, it should reverse the judgment, on the ground that since the repeal of the acts of 1893 and 1899 the State has no power to enforce any taxes levied thereunder. Held that:
As the Federal question on which the writ of error is prosecuted has not become a moot one, and the affirmance of the judgment on that question alone will not prejudice the right of plaintiffs in error to have the purely local question of whether the State still has the right to enforce the taxes levied prior to the act of 1905, determined by the state court, it is the duty of this court to consider and decide the Federal question only leaving the local question open for investigation in, and adjudication by, the state courts.
The Fourteenth Amendment does not deprive a State of the power to regulate and burden the right to inherit, but at the most can only be held to restrain such an exercise of power as would e-xclude the conception of judgment and discretion and would be so obviously arbitrary and unreasonable as to be beyond the pale of governmental authority; and the statutes of California, therefore, are not unconstitutional because near relatives by affinity are preferred to collateral relatives.
TUm facts are stated in the opinion.

case can be distinguished from the Magoun, case, 170 U. S. 283, 303, and Billings v. Illinois, 188 U. S. 97, one of which upheld a classification on amount of property and the other on the character of the property.
When a classification of persons inter sese is made, then all persons standing alike in the eyes of the law must be placed in the same class; and if some are omitted and thereby discriminated against, they are denied the equal protection of
the law. This is a tax act. Plummer v. Coler, 178 U. S. 115; Dos
Passos on Inheritance Tax Laws, 37; Est. of Wilmerding, 117 California, 281; Est. of Campbell, 143 California, 627; Eyre v. Jacobs, 14 Gratt. 427; State v. Hamlin, 86 Maine, 494. As to what the classification of persons subjected to tax laws may be see Minot v. Winthrop, 162 Massachusetts, 113; Black v. State, 113 Wisconsin, 205; and as to the rule by which the constitutionality of the classification may be tested see Gulf Co. v. Ellis, 165 U. S. 150; St. Louis Railway v. Paul, 62 Am. St. Rep. 175, note. The classification must always be based on reasonable grounds. Conolly v. Sewer Pipe Co., 184 U. S. 540, 563; Coifing v. Stock Yards, 183 U. S. 79; Sugar Co. v. Louisiana, 179 U.

In this case there is no reasonable ground for the classification which has been made and tested by the Magoun,case, supra; it is unconstitutional. The legislative history of collateral tax laws shows that this law is improper and unusual. Connecticut Statutes of 1888 and see the California act revising this law. Statutes, 1905, 341.
Presumptions in favor of the validity of this legislation should not be indulged. Cases supra and Smyth v. Ames, 169 U. S. 466, 527; Yiek- Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S. 366.

OCTOBER TERM, 1905.

Opinion of the Court.

200 U. S.

IR. JusicE WHiTE delivered the opinion of the court.

In 1893 a law was enacted in California, imposing a charge on collateral inheritances and on bequests and devises. California Stat. 1893, p. 193. The burdens which the law imposed were not laid upon inheritances, bequests or devises in favor of the father, mother, husband, wife, children, brother or sister of a decedent, or wife or widow of a son, or the husband of a daughter of the decedent, adopted children and certain public and charitable corporations. In the year 1899 the law of 1893 was amended. The amendment caused the charge imposed by the prior act to become applicable in the case of brothers and sisters of a decedent. This resulted because the amendment omitted brothers and sisters from the enumeration made in the act of 1893 of persons to whom the act was not to apply. California Stat. 1899, p. 101.
In December, 1900, Cornelia E. Campbell died intestate in the city of San Francisco, and her estate was administered upon by the appropriate court. In December, 1901, a final decree was entered, apportioning the estate remaining, after the payment of certain specified amounts, among three brothers and a sister who are the plaintiffs in error in this court. One of the sums directed by the decree to be paid before distribution was a collateral inheritance charge of $488.70, under the act of 1893 as amended in 1899.
The brothers and sister appealed to the Supreme Court of California from that portion of the decree directing the payment of the charge just mentioned. The validity of the law imposing the burden was assailed upon various grounds of a local nature, and upon the Federal ground that the amendatory act of 1899, in so far as it purported to impose a charge on inheritances, bequests or devises to brothers and sisters, denied the equal protection of the laws, and was hence repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The Supreme Court of California affirmed the decree. In doing so it held that the contentions of a local nature were without merit,

200 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

and that the act of 1893 as amended by the act of 1899 was not in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment. 143 California 623.
With the questions of a local nature decided by the state court we are not concerned, and shall therefore confine our attention to the Federal question, that is, the alleged repugnancy to the Fourteenth Amendment, imposing the burden in question on brothers and sisters.
The asserted repugnance of the statute to the Constitution of the United States, as elaborately argued at bar, rests upon the proposition that the statute denied tobrothers and sisters of a decedent the equal protection of the laws, because the statute embraced an inheritance, bequest or devise in favor of a brother or sister, and did not include bequests or devises in favor of a wife or widow of a son or the husband of a daughter of the decedent.
Before coming to consider this subject we must notice a wholly independent question, which the plaintiffs in error assert renders a reversal necessary, irrespective of the merits of the contention based upon the Federal question.
In March, 1905, since the record on this writ of error was filed in this court, the State of California enacted a new inheritance tax law. California Stat. 1905, p. 341. This act differs from the act of 1893 as amended in 1899 in many particulars. It includes within the classes subjected to the burdens imposed persons not embraced in the act of 1893 as amended, and whilst it does not except from its operation persons embraced in the prior act as amended, creates as to some of such persons a different rate and carves out exemptions as to designated amounts of property, not found in the earlier act. Besides, by the act, brothers and sisters or a descendant of such brothers and sisters, and the wife or widow of a son or a husband of a daughter of a decedent, are made subject to a like charge, less, however, in rate than the one theretofore imposed upon a brother or sister. The act of 1905, as declared in its title and as manifested by its provisions, was intended to cover generally the subject of inheritance taxes, and by necessary effect operated to amend and

OCTOBER TERAT, 1905.

Opinion of the Court

reenact the prior laws on the subject. In the body of the act was contained a section (27), expressly repealing the act of 1893 and the amendments thereto, without embodying a clause saving the right of the State in respect to the charges which had accrued to the State under the prior acts.
The proposition is, that the act of 1905 relieved the plaintiffs in error from the duty to pay resulting from the prior laws, even if those laws were not repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment, and, therefore, the contention is that it becomes our duty to so decide, and hence to reverse the judgment without passing upon the Federal question. The plaintiffs in error do not suggest that the writ of error be dismissed because by the California statute, upon which they rely, the constitutional question has become merely a moot one, but their contention is that we should maintain jurisdiction and reverse upon the ground previously stated. We cannot assent to the proposition. The statute upon which it is based was enacted subsequently to the decision of the Supreme Court of California, and if that statute had the effect, as asserted, of depriving the State of power to enforce the judgment below rendered, the right to claim relief, based upon the action of the State, taken since the Supreme Court of California decided the case, will, we assume, be open to investigation in the state courts, if, in deciding the Federal question adversely to the plaintiffs in error, we do not conclude the question referred to. Under these conditions we thinkit is our duty to decide the Federal question upon which the writ of error was prosecuted, and leave open the purely local question, which has arisen since the decision by the lower court.
Of course, of our own motion we must determine whether the enactment of the subsequent statute so obviously had the effect of relieving the plaintiffs in error from the burden imposed by the judgment below as to cause the Federal question to become merely a moot one. In view of the general and continuing nature of the legislation contained in the statute of 1905 (Bear Lake IrrigationCo. v. Garland, 164 U. S. 1; Steamship Co. v. Jolife,2 Wall. 450), we are clearly of the opinion that it cannot

CAMPBELL v. CALIFORNIA.

200 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

be said that this case has become a moot one. Especially is this true when the ruling of the Supreme Court of California in Estate of Stanford, 126 California, 112, is considered. In that case, in 1897, while an appeal was pending in the Supreme Court of California from a decree directing the payment by the Estate of Stanford of a charge or charges imposed by authority of the act of 1893, the legislature of California amended the act and established certain exemptions, which it declared should apply to all property which had passed by will, succession or transfer after the approval of the act of 1893, except in those cases where the tax had been paid to the treasurer of the proper county. As to enforce the amendatory act would have relieved the Estate of Stanford from the burdens of which complaint was made, the question presented to the Supreme Court of California was whether, if the burdens were authorized by the act of 1893, it was the duty of the court to apply the provisions of the amendatory act and reverse the judgment pending before it, because the right to enforce the impositions had terminated by the effect of the amendatory act. After deciding that the act of 1893 authorized the burdens complained of, the court, in considering the terms of that statute, the nature and character of an inheritance tax, and the power of the State over the disposition of property in case of death, held that it was its duty to affirm the decree because of the vested right existing in the State under the act of 1893, and because the act of 1897, in attempting to abrogate such vested right, was repugnant to specified provisions of the constitution of California. Putting aside then all question as to the operation of the statute of 1905, and reserving from any decree which we may render all rights, if any, in favor of the plaintiffs in error which may have arisen from the passage of that statute, we are brought to a consideration of the merits of the Federal question.
The contention is that the assailed law of California was repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment, because it subjected
to the burdens of an inheritance tax or charge brothers and sisters of a decedent, and did not subject to any burden such

strangers to the blood as the wife or widow of a son or the husband of a daughter of a decedent. We do not stop to refer in detail to the many forms of argument by which the contention is sought to be sustained, but content ourselves with stating that, whatever be the form in which the propositions relied on are advanced, they all reduce themselves to and must depend upon the soundness of the contention that the Fourteenth Amendment compels the States, in levying inheritance taxes, and, a fortiori, in regulating inheritances, to conform to blood relationship. That is to say, in their last analysis all the arguments depend upon the proposition that the Fourteenth Amendment has taken away from the States their power to regulate the passage of property by death or the burdens which may be imposed resulting therefrom, because that amendment confines the States absolutely, both as to the passage of such property and as to the burdens iinposed thereon, to the rule of
blood relationship. To state the proposition is to answer it. Its unsoundness is demonstrated by previous decisions of this court. Magoun v. Illinois Trust &-Savings Bank, 170 U. S. 283; Orient Insurance Co. v. Daggs, 172 U. S. 557, 562. It is true that in the first of the cited cases it was expressly declared or impliedly recognized that in the exercise by a State of its undoubted power to regulate the burdens which might be imposed on the passage of property by death, a case might be conceived of where a burden would be so arbitrary as to amount to a denial of the equal protection of the laws. But this suggestion did not imply that the effect of the Fourteenth Amendment was to control the States in the exercise of their plenary authority to regulate inheritances and to determine the persons or objects upon which an inheritance burden should be imposed. In this case there can be no doubt, if the right of a State be conceded to select the persons who may inherit or upon whom the burden resulting from an inheritance may be imposed, the complaint against the statute is entirely without merit. The whole case, therefore, must rest upon the assumption that because the State of California has not followed the rule of blood relation-

CAMPBELL v. CALIFORNIA.

Opinion of the Court.

ship, but as to particular classes has applied the rule of affinity by marriage, therefore the constitutional provision guaranteeing the equal protection of the laws was violated. But, unless the effect of the Fourteenth Amendment was inexorably to limit the States in enacting inheritance laws to the rule of blood relationship, such a regulation plainly involved the exercise of legislative discretion and judgment, with which the Fourteenth Amendment did not interfere. Such a regulation cannot in reason be said to be an exercise of merely arbitrary power. To illustrate. It assuredly would not be an arbitrary exercise of power for a State to put in one class, for the purpose of inheritance or the burdening of the privilege to inherit, all blood relatives to a designated degree, excluding brothers and sisters, and to place all other and more remote blood relatives, including brothers and sisters, in a second class along with strangers to the blood. This being true it cannot, without causing the equality clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to destroy the powers of the States on a subject of a purely local character, be held that a classification which takes near relatives by marriage and places them in a class with lineal relatives is so arbitrary as to transcend the limits of governmental power. If this were not true, state legislation preferring a wife in the distribution of the estate of her husband to a brother or sister of the husband would be void as repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment. So also would be the provision in the California statute we are considering, preferring an adopted child of a decedent to a brother or sister. With the motives of public policy which may induce a State to prefer near relatives by affinity to collateral relatives, we are not concerned, since the Fourteenth Amendment does not deprive a State of the power to regulate and burden the right to inherit, but at the most can only be held to restrain such an exercise of power as would exclude the conception of judgment and discretion, and which would be so obviously arbitrary and unreasonable as to be beyond the pale of governmental authority.

RODRIGUEZ v. VIVONI.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRI17T COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE DISTRICT OF PORTO RICO.
No. 209. Argued March 14, 1906.-Decided April 2,1906.
Remote explanations as to the use and meaning of a word will be rejected when the will offers upon its face a different and more obvious one.
The words sucesion legitima in the will of a Porto Rican held to mean "issue," and not. "lawful heirs."
This court will not consider a claim which was not set up in the bill or in the court below, nor suggested until after the argument in this court.
THE facts are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Fritz v. Briesen, with whom were Mr. Charles M. Boerman and Mr. Stephen M. Hoye on the brief, for appellant:
The real point in issue, in determining the proper construction of the will, is whether the words "sucesion legitima" used in the thirteenth, the residuary clause of the will, mean "legal issue" or "legal heirs." If the former, this appeal must fail; if the latter, the complainant is entitled to take as the legal heir of her daughter, Felipa Benecia.
The primary and technical meaning of the words "sucesion legitima" is "legal heirs."
As used in the Spanish Codes and law dictionaries the words "sucesion legitima" have a meaning which may be most nearly expressed by the English words "intestate succession." Escriche, Diccionario Razonado de Legislacion y Jurisprudencia, Paris, 1852, tit. "Sucesion legitima;" Pothier, 8 (Euvres (Edited by Bugnet), Paris, .1890, TraitO des Succesions, 1;

Code of Civil Procedure of 1889 -(War Dept. Translation), Art. 912.
See also Civil Code of Porto Rico, 1902 (in RevisedStatutes of Porto Rico), §§ 664-666, 886. This Code makes a distinction between legitimate succession, which is that which the law has established in favor of the nearest relatives of the deceased (§ 666 v.) and irregular succession which is that established in favor of certain persona or of the people of Porto Rico in the absence of legal heirs or those instituted by will.
See also Code of Louisiana, New Orleans, 1861, Arts. 871875, where the same distinction is drawn.
It is a peculiar provision of the civil law that, in -view of the fact that an heir is liable for all or a share of the debts of the deceased, he may refuse the inheritance altogether. In such a case, he is considered as not being an heir, and as never having been an heir.,
Thus by collocation of ideas the words "sucesion legitima" are used to designate those of the, nearest relatives who take the inheritance. See Resolution of June 25, 1895, in Alcubilla, Diccionario de la Administration Espafiola, Madrid, Appendix Volume'for 1895, page 795, Tit. "Jurisprudencia Hipotecaria y Notarial." The case is also printed in full in Scaevola, 3 Jurisprudencia del Codigo Civil, Madrid, 1901, page 213. See also Century Dictionary, "Succession."
The words "sucesion legitima" are never used in the Code
to designate legitimate issue, except in so far as the "sucesion legitima" goes first to the descendants (Art. 930), and, in the absence of descendants, or of their refusal to take, to the ascendants, and in their absence or refusal to take, to the collateral relatives., If, therefore, a deed or will provides that the property is to go to the. sucesion legitima," then, if there are children, it necessarily means "the children. But, if there be no children, it means. ascendants; and if there be no ascendants, then it means the collateral relatives.
We have an analogous use of the word "heirs" in Qur law,

See Ide v. Ide, 5 Massachusetts, 500; Gifford v. Choate, 100 Massachusetts, 345; Heath v. Hewitt, 127 N. Y. 166.
It is the general rule of the Spanish law that wills are to be construed exactly as they read, unless such construction be a ridiculous one. Law 5, Title 33,. Partida 7, of the Laws of Las Siete Partidas. This law has been reenacted in the Civil Code, Art. 675.
The law has been construed in a number of decisions of the Supreme Court of Spain, reported-in the Jurisprudencia Civil. Sentence of December 20, 1862, vol. 7, No. 315, p. 787; Sentence of December 11, 1865, vol. 12, No. 439, p. 461; Decision
of June 21, 1872, vol. 26, No. 204, pp. 15, 16; Sentence of March 3, 1873, vol. 27, No. 108, p. 395.
The same provisions are found in our law of the construction of wills. The plain meaning of the words used in a will is always presumed to be their meaning, and the burden of proof that they are used in another sense is upon the party claiming so. See Aspden's .Estate, Fed. Cas. No. 589; Daley v. James, 8 Wheat. 534; Osborne v. Shrieve, 3 Mason, 391.
It is also invariably so held in the States where the civil law similar to that of Porto Rico is in force, as, for. example, in.Louisiana and California. Norris v. Hensley, 27 California,
439, 450; Sharpe v. Kleinberter, 7 La. Ann. 264. In construing a will,-the words are to be construed accord-
ing to their -natural import, unless the context evidently points out that in the particular instance there should be some other construction. Sheriff v. Brown, 5 Mackey, 172; In re Hallet, 8 Paige, 378; Puryear v. Edmonson, 4 Heisk, 51. A testator must be presumed to have used words in their ordinary primary sense or meaning. In re Woodward, 117 N. Y. 522. All doubts are to be resolved in favor of the testator's having said exactly what he meant. Cady v. Bunn, 46 N. J. .Eq. 131: Where the provisions of the will are clear and simple, no reason exists for taking the testator's words in any other than their natural sense. Wiley v. Lockwood, 86 N. Y. 301; Lovett v.

will is, not what the testator meant, but what is the meaning of the words used by him. Barrow's Appeal (Pa.), 8 Cent. Rep. 132; Bates v. Woodruff, 123 Illinois, 205.
Provisions relating to fideicommissary substitutions are to be liberally construed, so as to prevent the taking place of the substitution. Pothier, "Traitk des Substitution," Works, Paris, 1890, edited by Bugnet, vol. 8, p. 477.
The construction of the words "sucesion legitima" as legal heirs is the one intended by the testator. The will was drawn by a notary public, an officer held in high respect in Porto Rico: and appointed for his knowledge of the law of conveyancing and drafting of wills. The words were therefore used in their technical legal sense.

Mr. X, B. K. Pettingill, for appellees, submitted: Under both the Spanish and American systems the courts will so construe wills, irrespective of the technical meanings of the words used, as to determine and carry out the real intention of a testator. The rule in our own law is firmly fixed. Robinson v. Portland Asylum, 123 U. S. 707; Kenaday v. Sinnott, 179 U. S. 616. There are numerous decisions of the Supreme Court of Spain in which almost the same language is used. Cayetano
Codina v. Felipe Codina, Sentence of June 30, 1866, Jurisprudencia Civil, vol. 14, p. 237; Romero v. Romero, Sentence of Dec. 10, 1866, Juris. Civ., vol. 14, p. 793.
For meaning of "sucesion legitima" see Dictionary Royal Spanish Academy, p. 932; Lopez, Spanish-English Dictionary, p. 57.7; Sentence, vol. 61, p. 10, Juris Civ.; Sentence, vol. 51, p. 422, Juris. Civ.
See the American decisions which hold that where the word "heirs" is used by a testator it often.is shown by the context to mean "issue" or "descendants." Randolph v. Randolph, 40N. J. Eq. 77; Canfield v. Canfield, 118 Fed. Rep. 1 (C. C. A.); Abbott v. Essex Co., 18 How. 202; Barber v. Pittsburg Ry. Co., 166 U. S. 83.

RODRIGUEZ v. VIVONI.

201 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

To hold that the devise was to each of the eight persons and their "heirs" would destroy the express provision of "fideicomiso" or trust and leave the phrase "con calidad de fideicomiso" useless and ineffective.
It would also leave without meaning the further provision for the mutual benefit of the eight, because a person very seldom dies without "heirs" in the broad sense, and even in that event the Civil Code of Porto Rico, then in force, provided that in default of other heirs the State would inherit. War Department translation, arts. 956, 958.
It would not give due weight and meaning to the use by the testator of the word "legitimate" in connection with the word "sucesion," because in the paragraph in question the word "legitimate" would be superfluous as modifying the general term "heirs," while it becomes important as a limiting word if it modifies "issue."
That these trust provisions under the term "fideicomiso" were common in the Spanish law were recognized as valid when not creating a perpetuity and their meaning and construction well determined, see the Sentencia of the Supreme Court of Spain in Moya v. Moya, April 22, 1865, Juris. Civ., vol. 11, p. 534.

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.'

This is a bill for the partition of real estate in which the female plaintiff claims one undivided eighth as heir to her daughter Felipa Benicia, who died an infant without issue. This d:.:ghter got her title under the will of Thomas Jos6 Ramirez, and the question is whether, in the event which happened, her share went to her mother by descent or to her fellow devisees by the terms of the will. The other devisees all were living at her death. The case was heard upon a plea setting up the foregoing facts, together with the will, and the bill was dismissed. Thereupon the plaintiffs appealed to this court.

OCTOBER TERM, 1905.

Opinion of the Court.

201 U. S.

The material clause of the will is as follows: "Trece.-Et remanente de mis bienes, derechos y acciones lo lego con calidad de fideicomiso y que acrezcan las demas, caso de fallecimiento sin sucesion legitima, .por iguales partes, a mis sobrinas Dofia Cornelia y Dofia Antonia Martinez, Dofia Monserrate,. Dofia Obdulia, Dofia Encarnacion, Dofia Angela y Dofia Concesion Ramirez de Arellano y Felipa Benicia mi
hija de crianza," etc. We vary slightly the translation in the record. "The remainder of my goods, rights and actions I bequeath in the character of fideicommissum and that the other [shares] may [profit 'by] accretion, in case of death without sucesion legitima, by equal parts to my nieces [named] and Felipa Benicia my foster child, who shall adopt my surname," with appointment of a guardian for the last, a provision for her education, and a request that when that is finished she return to live with the said nieces.
It is agreed that it is possible for "sucesion legitima" to mean either issue or lawful heirs. If it means the latter, the mother inherited, as she-was the lawful heir. If it means the former, then, by the terms of the will, Felipa Benicia's share went to the testator's nieces when she died. It seems to us too plain to need extended elucidation that "sucesion legitima" here means issue. The argument on tle other side that the purpose is merely to prevent an escheat by making the nieces and Filipa Benicia reciprocal successors, to impose a fetter on free alienation and to enhance the dowry of the nieces, strikes us as fanciful. The natural object of this fideicommissary substitution is that which is said to be its object, to secure accretion among the shares. But that' purpose would pretty nearly vanish into thin air if death without heirs were the event in view. For each of the'nieces being heir to all the others, accretion among them would be excluded. It is argued, to be sure, that they might repudiate the inheritance and then claim under the will, if any of the nieces died heavily in debt. Whether this would be true by Spanish law we need not inquire. For such remote explanations must be rejected when

the will offers a different and more obvious one upon its face. And while it is pressed that substitutions are strictly construed in favor of the first taker, we do not understand that or any
other rule of construction to require a perversion of language, or to govern a case where the second taker stands on an equal .footing with the first in the testator's mind, with equal mutual chances, and when the plainly expressed purpose is to create an artificial class, with cross limitations in case of death with-
out a child. A suggestion is made by an afterthought, in a brief filed
since the argument, that the testator could not exclude the mother of Felipa from her right, as necessary or forced heir, to two-thirds of Felipa's share. The suggestion comes too
late. No such claim was set up in the bill, or, so far as appears, in the court below. Therefore we shall not consider at length whether, in case of a pure gratuity to one to whom the testator was under no legal obligation, the Spanish law entitled a forced heir to claim against the words of a gift like this. The texts cited are no.t sufficient to establish the proposition, and the contrary seems to be shown by Ley 10, Tit. 4, Part. 6, and,. note 13, Madrid ed. 1848. See also 4 Escriche, 1051, 1052, sub. v. Substitucion Fideicomisaria, ad fin. On
the, whole case the plaintiffs must abide by the construction and the law in which, it would seem from the bill, they have acquiesced for thirty years.

Although the auditor and both courts below. found that plaintiff in error's testator had been guilty of fraud and that his estate was liable, and under the general rule this court will not disregard a particular state of facts found by both courts below, still it can and will do so, when it is constrained to the conclusion that the premise upon which those courts acted is without any support in the evidence and rests upon a mere mistaken assumption; and so held in this case where the finding of fraud rested on the uncorroborated testimony of an interested witness who had been so discredited by uncontroverted evidence in regard to his own acts of omission and commission as to render it impossible to accept his testimony as establishing the alleged fraud of the deceased.
Where-by the law of their domicil, as is the case in Louisiana, minors are represented by their father as administrator, with full power under that law to receipt for, and administer for their account, property bequeathed to them by a testator domiciled and dying in Virginia, a transfer of such property to the father as the administrator or representative of his minor children by a person having possession thereof in the District of Columbia, is valid and binding.

IN June, 1898, Philip A. Tracy died in the city of Washington, where he was domiciled. His will,, executed in Washington on March 2, 1894, was duly probated in August, 1898. The will directed the executors to build a family monument, to cause to be inscribed thereon the names and the dates of the birth and death of the deceased, of his father and mother and of a brother and sister, in accordance with minute directions contained in a memorandum accompanying the will. A bequest of one thousand dollars was made to the Oak Hill Cemetery Company to perpetually care for the lot and the .Monument. In addition, after making several minor bequests, one of which, was a gift of one hundred dollars to the Home for Incurables, two thousand dollars was given for a Sunday School building for the Trinity Episcopal Church in the city of Washington. The residue of the estate was bequeathed "to the trustees of the Epiphany Church Home in this city, to pay for the enlargement of the building now used as the home, or for the erection of another building for the same use and purpose." George W. Oray and J. J. Darlington, the executors named in the will, qualified.
Within one year, and before receiving notice of the claim which is the subject of this suit, the executors of Tracy had paid the debts, had discharged the minor legacies above referred to, and had in hand to be applied to the other provisions of the will forty-seven thousand dollars in money and securi.ties and two unimproved lots in the city of Washington of small value. The further execution of the will was prevented by a demand to pay the claim which forms the basis of this suit, and upon refusal to do so on June 10, 1899, this bill in equity was filed to establish and enforce the claim. The complainants were Erle H. Turner and Wilmer Turner, and Ashby

and Lunette Turner; the last two, being minors, were represented by Wilmer Turner as their next friend.
It was in substance averred in the bill that Silas H. Turner, a paternal uncle of the complainants, died in Fauquier County, Virginia, on September 21, 1888, leaving a will by which he bequeathed equally to complainants, who were the children of Thomas M. Turner, all the property of which the testator died possessed, the will being as follows:

"WASHINGTON, D. C., April 30, 1888. "I hereby give and bequeath to the four children of my brother Thomas M. Turner of Minden, Louisiana, all property real and personal, owned by me, or in which I have any interest at the time of my death, and appoint Philip A. Tracy to distribute the proceeds of the said property equally between them.
"S. H. TURNER. "Witness: PHILIP A. TRACY.
"GEORGE G, FENTON."

It was also alleged that this will was admitted to probate in Fauquier County, Virginia, on or about November 28, 1888; It was then alleged that Philip A. Tracy was the confidential agent and trustee of Turner, deceased, and in that capacity had in his possession money which, as agent and trustee, Tracy had invested for the benefit of said Turner. It was charged that shortly before the death of Turner, Tracy had given Turner a memorandum or list, entirely in the handwriting of Tracy, stating the dates and amounts of the promissory notes held by Tracy, belonging to said Turner, and the names of the makers thereof, and that the said notes aggregated $28,972.10. This memorandum or list, alleged to be wholly in the handwriting of Tracy, was copied in the bill, and it was averred that after the death of Turner, Tracy had admitted the accuracy of said list and his possession of the notes which it embraced. It was then averred that the land records of the District of Columbia

Statement of the Case.

202 U. S.

disclosed that all the notes mentioned in the alleged memorandum or list and the accrued interest had been paid after the death of Silas H. Turner. It was averred that, with the exception of a sum of about fourteen hundred dollars, alleged to have been paid by Tracy to.Erle H. Turner, no account had been rendered or distribution made b Tracy of tle aforesaid property or of the proceeds thereof, and, that, excluding the payment alleged to have been made, as above stated, to Erle H. Turner, "the entire trust fund, principal and interest and profits, had come into the possession of the defendants as executors of Tracy."
The paragraph of the bill immediately preceding the prayer was as follows:
"21. That the domicil and citizenship of. the parents of complairiants have always been since the birth of these complainants either in the State of Louisiana, which was their domicil, until about the - day of August, 1889, or in the State of Texas, which has been since and is now the domicil of said parents and of all complainants, exqept complainant Erle H. Turner, whose domicil is now Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Complainants are informed and believe and therefore aver that by the laws of Louisiana and of Texas the parents of minor children are not of right guardians of the estate of such minors, and no person is authorized to receive or demand the estate of any minor domiciled in either of said States, except such persons as shall be duly appointed by a court of the States having competent jurisdiction; and that neither the father nor the mother of any of these complainants nor any other person has ever been appointed by any court guardian of either the p rson or estate of any one of these complainants, and no one of these complainants has now or has ever had a legal guardian of the person or estate, and at no time has there been any person in being competent in law to demand or receive, ibnythreeairbehalf, ny estate fQr any of these omplainants, until, *son of reaching their majority, two of these complainants have become sui juris."

DARLINGTON v. TURNER.

202.U. S.

Statement of the Case.

Discovery was prayed of a paper which had been written and left by Tracy, containing representations regarding the claim of complainants. In substance the prayer was for a discovery and account in t04 premises, and for a decree distributing
among the complainants the sum which might be found due upon the account. There was also a prayer for general relief.
The answer of the executors of Tracy was in substance as follows: That Silas H. Turner and Trauy had business relations was admitted; but in the main all the material averments of the bill were alleged not to be within the knowledge of the executors, and proof of such averments was demanded. It was expressly averred, however, that Tracy, after the death. of Silas H. Turner, had fully accounted for any property which he had in his possession, by a transfer and payment made to Thomas M. Turner, the father of the complainants, as their natural tutor and agent, they being then minors, as evidericed by a receipt signed by Thomas M. Turner, and 7dated November 30, 1888, which receipt was copied in the answer. Answering the paragraph of the bill calling for the discovery in respect to the paper left by Tracy regarding the claim of complainants, the defendants set forth that there came into their possession the following paper:

"WASHINGTON, D. C., -, 1898. "To the executors of my last will and testament:
"Some time in 1871, Silas H. Turner of Virginia, whom I had known for a long time, of his own volition and without solicitation from me, came to the city and asked me to aid him in investing some twelve thousand dollars ($12,000) in real estate notes. I consented and in a few weeks the whole amount was invested, and he took the notes home with him. The interest was payable semi-annually, and, for a time, he sent me notes by mail about the time the interest was due so that it could be credited on the notes to satisfy the maker. This becafne irksome and, after a time, be brought me the notes, keeping a list of them, and asked me to keep them to

save him the trouble of sending them to me by mail whenever the interest was due. I kept the notes in an envelopie with his name upon it, and about twice a year sent him a memorandum of interest paid, and when the amount reached several hundred dollars I would buy another note, and send him a memorandum of the same. Also when a note was matured and paid; I would' buy another note, unless he needed the money, which he rarely did, and send him a memorandum of it. This condition continued until 1888, when he died in Virginia, leaving his entire*estate to the three minor children of his brother then living inLouisiana. In his will he named me to settle up the estate and divide the money among the children; but, as the laws of Virginia require two witnesses to a will and says neither of them shall be an executor, I could not qualify, and, as the father, if appointed, could not have given the bond, I handed him the package of notes, advised him to deposit them in the Second National Bank of Washington, D. C., which he did, and agreed to look after them and have them all paid, he being out of the city. His other relations, a sister, some nephews and nieces were much displeased with the will, and threatened to attempt to have it set aside,. but have not done so. The father, a good, honest man, took the money or most of it, went to Texas and bought a farm, and was doing well until the panic of 1893 came on. Since then they had a hard time, getting little or nothing for their farm products, and have written me some heartrending letters, wishing they had left the money here. The children are of age, but of course the father could not pay them their parts of the estate, and though not a word has been said about it, I thought perhaps after my death, if they hear of it in time, some of them might attempt to hold me responsible, and if they should make such an attempt I hereby authorize and direct my executors to employ the best counsel in the city to defend my estate in the District Courts and in the Supreme Court of the United States, if it be necessary to appeal the. case to that court, and to pay all costs and lawyers' fees out of my estate.

DARLINGTON v. TURNER.

202 U. S.

Statement of the Case.

I suppose some one would have to qualify as administrators under the will before any action could be taken. My turning the property over to the father helped to keep it in possession of those to whom it was left, and to discourage and shut out the dissatisfied relatives, for if any one had qualified the matter would have been open for a year, and they would undoubtedly have made an attempt to have the will set aside. This is a plain statement of the case, intended for the private ears of my executors."
Referring to the prayer for discovery in other respects, it was averred that the only papers concerning business dealings between Tracy and Silas H. Turner which had come into the possession of the executors were the receipt given by Thomas M. Turner, as already stated, the memorandum of Tracy addressed to his executors, and various letters and receipts signed by Erle H. Turner. The executors specially alleged that to their knowledge none of the proceeds of any of the notes referred to in the alleged memorandum or list averred in the complaint had ever come into the hands of the executors, and that they had no knowledge of any disposition made of any property belonging to Silas H. Turner which might have been in the hands of Tracy, except as shown by the receipt of November 30, 1888, signed by Thomas M. Turner as natural tutor and agent of his minor children. The laches of the complainants was expressly set up as depriving them of the right to any of the relief asked for. Denying knowledge of where Thomas M. Turner was domiciled at the time of the signing of the receipt, or the lawful powers of Turner as to signing the receipt, the court was asked to determine the rights of the executors in the premises.
After joinder of issue and the taking of general evidence the case was heard in the Supreme Court of the District.
In substance the court in its opinion declared that Tracy and Thomas M. Turner, the father of the complainants, had conspired 'to despoil them, they being then minors, of their rightful share of their uncle's estate; that the receipt given by

Turner to Tracy did not protect Tracy or his estate, because Turner had not qualified in accordance with the laws of Louisiana so as to entitle him to represent his minor children, but even if he had so'qualified Tracy had no authority to pay from the fund in his hand except in the due course of administration. The court also observed that the words of the will appointing Tracy to distribute the proceed of the property bequeathed equally between the four children of Thomas M. Turner imposed the duty upon Tracy of qualifying as executor, or, if he was unable or unwilling to do so, of applying to the court for the appointment of a suitable.person. And the fraud and wrong of Tracy in turning over the property to the father was emphasized by the statement that Tracy wrote the will of the deceased and was then informed by the latter that his object was to prevent his estate from coming into the hands of the father of the children because of his spendthrift character. Although the court concluded that the estate of Tracy was liable, it did not fix the amount for which the estate was
accountable, but referred the matter to an auditor to state an account and to take further evidence in respect to the expenditures properly chargeable against the share of each of the coTmhpelaianuadnittsorupon the principles expressed in the opinion.
heard additional testimony bearing upon the expenditures made by Thomas M. Turner for the maintenance of his children out of the fund which he had received from Tracy. An account as of February 1, 1894, was stated to the court. On this account the receipt given by Thomas M. TUrner was disregarded. The sum in the hands of Tracy and due to the estate of Silas H. Turner was fixed by the alleged list set out in the bill. The ground upon which ihis was done was thus stated by the auditor in his re)ort:
"After the death of Silas Turner there was found among his papers an envelope or jacket indorsed 'Notes belongieg to S. H. Turner 1888;" it contained a list, in the handwriting of Tracy, of the notes, giving the date, name of maker, and amount. The date of the last note on the list is given as

"It being conclusively shown that within six months before Turner's death Tracy had nearly $29,000.00 principal of securities in his possession as agent or trustee of Turner, the inevitable presumption of law is that of continued possession and accountability."
Making certain deductions and additions, which it is unnecessary presently to refer to, the auditor found the amount due from Tracy's estate on February 1, 1904, principal and interest, to be $48,601.44, which was attributed in varying proportions to the complainants, depending upon the amount which the report found each one of them was bound to contribute for maintenance or sums received out of the fund. The report was excepted to, exceptions were overruled, and' a decree was entered adjudging the sums found due to the complainants in accordance with the report, giving the right to collect the de-' ficiency out of further assets if any were discovered. An appeal was prosecuted. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decree, 24 App. D. C. 573, with a slight modification, rendered necessary by the allowance of an increased charge against Erle H. Turner. The Court of Appeals, in its opinion, in effect expressed views similar to those which had been stated in the opinion of the court below and in the report of the auditor. The receipt of Thomas M. Turner was disregarded. Taking into consideration the testimony, the paper alleged in the bill as a list was treated as being all in the handwriting of Tracy and as being but a single document, and, therefore, as fixing. the amount for which the estate of Tracy was accountable.

was made at the request and by reason of the representations of Turner and was, on Tracy's part, made in good faith and not with the purpose of personal profit. Turner was clerk of a court in Louisiana and his statements were made with apparent authority. There were no debts of the estate and there was no occasion for administration.
According to the laws of Louisiana, Thomas. M. Turner, as father of the complainants, had the right to the possession and enjoyment of the estates of his minor children during their minority. Revised Civil Code of Louisiana, 1870, in force in 1888; Book I, tit. 7, ch. 5, under the heading "Paternal authority; " §§ 221-224; Book II, tit. 3; §§ 533, 540, 560, 589.
These' provisions of the Code are construed and explained in the following cases: Cleveland v. Sprowl, 12 Rob. 172; Handy v. Parkinson,10 La. Ann. 92; Greenwood v. City of New Orleans, 12 La. Ann. 426; Snow v. Copley, 3 La. Ann. 610; Renfroe v. Gates, 7 La. Ann. 569; Succession of Allan, 48 La. Ann. 1240.
A voluntary payment by a person having in his hands funds belonging to persons living in a foreign jurisdiction is valid, if, according to the laws of that jurisdiction, the person to whom the payment was made had the right to receive the money; and a receipt given by such person is a valid discharge and acquittance to the person so paying the money.
The principle, that administration when had at all must be had within the jurisdiction 'in which a testator's will is filed,
or within the jurisdiction in which his property was situated, has no application to the present case.
Courts look with favor upon the private settlement of estates, where there are no debts or where the claims of creditors are satisfied. Akin v. Akin, 78 Georgia, 24; McCracken v. McCaslin, 50 Mo. App. 85; Roberts v. Messenger, 134 Pa. St. 298; Foote v. Foote, 61 Michigan, 181; Filbey v. Carrier, 45 Wisconsin, 469; Burton v. Brugier, 30 La. Ann. 479.
A voluntary payment to a foreign executor is a good discharge to the person making the payment, even as against a

subsequent demand by an executor appointed by the court in the jurisdiction in which the property was situated. Doolittle v. Lewis, 7 Johns. Ch. 45; Williams v. Storrs, 6 Johns. Ch. 353; Parsons v. Lyman, 20 N. Y. 103; Bank v. Sharp, 53 Maryland, 521; Wilkins v. Ellitt, 9 Wall. 740; Rand v. Hubbard, 4 Met. 252;*Hutchins v. Bank, 12 Met. 421; Stevens v. Gaylord, 11 Massachusetts, 256; Trecothick v. Austin, 4 Mason, 6, 33; Mackey v. Coxe, 18 How. 104.

Mr. William G. Johnson for appellees: The payment by Tracy to Turner was not a discharge, because a payment to anyone other than the party entitled or to his agent is no payment in law. Agency can only arise by contract or operation of law. The appellees made no such contract and could make none, because they 'were all minors and he had never been appointed their guardian, and his only relation to them was the natural one of father. The fact that Thomas M. Turner was the. father of the complainants is immaterial. Payment to him was no better than to a stranger. Dagley v. Tolferry, 1 P. Wms. 285; Cooper v. Thornton, 3 Brown's Ch. Cas. 96; Miles v. Kaigler, 10 Yerg. 10; Perry v.
Carmichael, 95 Illinois, 519. See also Tripp v. Gifford, 155 Massachusetts, 111; P. C. C. & St. L. Ry.v. Haley, 170 Illinois, 610.
Thomas Turner had no power under Louisiana laws to receive payment.
He was not a "natural tutor," as he describes himself in signing the receipt. At that time his wife, the mother of the
children, was living and the parents were not divorced. During the marriage there cannot be a "natural tutor." State v. Parish Judge of Orleans, 6 La. Rep. 363.
Turner never complied with requirements of Louisiana law made a condition precedent to the right of possession. It is not, therefore, in the character of "tutor" that he could ac-
quire any rights to the estate of his minor children, but this right is claimed for him as "usufructuary." Arts. 223, 224,

Louisiana laws have no application to property without the State. If Louisiana's laws of permission can have greater force in this District than in Louisiana, then, indubitably, her laws of prohibition upon those attempting to exercise authorities under them must have at least an equal force here with that which they possess in Louisiana.
According to the decisions of the highest court of that State, construing its own statutes, Thomas Turner, had he complied with all the prerequisites of the laws of Louisiana, would have been without power, under its laws, to receive property situated out of the State. Moise v. Life Association, 45 La. Ann. 737.

The right of usufructuary claimed for Thomas Turner, under the laws of Louisiana, in this case, is not an official char-
acter in which he is representative of the Louisiana legatees and claims the legacy in their behalf, but is a beneficial interest inhimself, in right of his parentage, a part of the Louisiana law of domestic relations, applying to persons and property within the State, and can clearly have no application to property never in the State.

MR. JUSTICiE WHITE, after making the foregoing statement, -delivered the opinion of the court.

As no reference was made to the subject in the opinions below and as we construe the argument at bar as not seriously pressing such question, we assume, for the purposes of the case, the right of the complainants to maintain under the averments. of their bill a direct action or suit to recover the fund in con-

DARLINGTON v. TURNER.

Opinion of the Court.

troversy. To come to the substantial merits we summarily dispose of certain preliminary contentions. First. We are of opinion that upon the pleadings and proof the Court of Appeals did not err in holding that such fiduciary relation existed between Silas II.Turner and Philip A. Tracy as made a court of equity the proper forum to seek relief. Second. We also think that under the circumstances of the case the contention that the bill should be dismissed because of the variance between the allegations and the proof is untenable.
In proper sequence the questions for decision are threefold: First. Was the transfer of the property of the estate of Silas H. Turner made as shown on the receipt given to Tracy by Thomas M. Turner as the representative of his minor children lawful and binding upon such minors? Second. If the payment referred to was binding (lid the receipt and the paper contemporaneously executed by Tracy, in connection with the proof, establish that he or his estate was liable for the value of the investment in real estate shown by the receipt and the paper in question to have been retained in the control of Tracy? Third. Did the receipt, if binding, and the paper in connection with it, embrace all the property held by Tracy as the trustee of Silas H. Turner, or, in other words, (lid Tracy at the time the receipt was given honestly account for the property in his hands, or did he fraudulently retain for his own benefit a large amount of property of the estate which should have been paid over and for which Tracy or his estate is therefor liable?
Whilst in logical order the questions for decision are as stated, we shall consider them inversely. In other words, we shall first dispose of the alleged fraudulent retention by Tracy of a large portion of the trust fund at the time he made the payment and transfer of property to Thomas M. Turner as the representative of his minor children. We do this because the charge of conspiracy and fraud as pressed, not only in the argument at bar, but in the opinions below, was treated as affecting the question of the binding nature of the transfer made by Tracy to Turner; and by first disposing of that branch of the case

OCTOBER TERM, 1905.

Opinion of the Court.

202 U. S.

we shall in a great measure disentangle the question of the binding efficacy of the transfer and payment to Thomas M. Turner from the alleged fraud.
It will be useful, before particularly considering the facts upon which the alleged fraud on the part of Tracy immediately depends, \o state the antecedents of Tracy and of the two Turners, the dealings between them and the results which followed therefrom, so far as they are uncontroverted.
Philip A Tracy was born in Fauquier County, Virginia, in 1835. He was living in Washington soon after the close of the ,Civil War, was a bookkeeper in a mercantile house, and later became an employ6 of the Post Office Department, and so continued, if not to, at least up to a short time prior to, his death. He never married. As far isit may be inferred from the testiniony in the record, taking no present concern of the charges
of fraud. made in the bill, the conviction is irresistibly conveyed to our mind that Tracy was a reasonably intelligent, moral, industrious and circumspect person, of a religious tendency of mind, careful in money matters, particular as to details and.of a kindly, though somewhat eccentric, nature.
Silas H. Turner was also a native of Virginia, and whilst little is shown by the record of his antecedents and character, it is established that he was also a man of thrift and of some business capacity, having been at one time a railroad agent, a dealer in merchandise and cattle, a clerk and an accountant, accustomed to the settlement of estates. Between Tracy and Turner there existed an association and friendship, taking its origin, if not in a boyhood acquaintance, at least one that related back to many years before the death of Turner. As a result of this friendship Turner, trusting in the capacity and integrity of Tracy, began in 1871 to confide his savings to the &1ter for investment. Tracy, loaning money upon the security of real estate, was first in the habit, when a loan was'made, of sending the notes of the borrowers to Turner, who, as the in-, terest payments were about to fall due, would send the notes to Tracy to have payments of interest credited thereon. After

DARLINGTON v. TURNER.

Opinion of the Court.

a time this practice of sending and returning the notes became irksome, and Turner sent the notes to Tracy, who thereafter kept them in his custody. As money came into the hands of Tracy, either from the payments of principal or of interest upon the notes, he reinvested .the money in other notes, sending Turner a memorandum of the new investments as made. There is nothing produced either from the papers of Tracy or of Turner showing that formal accounts were ever exchanged between the parties. Certain it is, that on April 30, 1898, Turner was in Washington and in personal communication with Tracy. At the desk of Tracy in the Post Office Department, at the request of Turner, the will probated as mentioned in the statement of facts was written by Tracy for Turner, and by the latter executed. How long Turner remained in Washington.-at this time the record does not disclose, nor does it accurately show his movements or exhibit any letters passilng between Tracy and Turner from the time of the making of the will up to the death of Turner.
Some tithe during the summer of 1888. Turner-an ill man, suffering with Bright's disease-went to the residence of Mrs. Rust, a niece, living in. Fauquier County, Virginia, near Warrenton, where he remained until his death on Septemher 21, 1888. At his death Turner left surviving him a maiden sister, who lived in Frederick, Maryland, Miss Henrietta Turner; a brother Thomas M. Turner, living in Minden, Louisiana, and various nephews and nieces, children of deceased brothers and sisters.
Between Thomas M. Turner, the brother living in Louisiana, and Silas H1. Turner, it would seem, there had been little or no intercourse for more than thirty years, Thomas having left Virginia when quite a young man. Notified of the serious illness of his brother, Thomas M. Turner, about a month and a half before the death of Silas, came to the house of Mrs. Rust and there remained until the death. Thomas M. Turner had had at that tine quite a varied experience of men and affairs. ieaving Virginiia as a youth he went to Memphis, Tennessee,

for the purpose of establishing a school. Not succeeding there he went to Missouri and became a bookkeeper for a commercial firm. At the outbreak of the war he joined the Confederate
army. At its termination he established himself at Minden, Louisiana, and began merchandising, and also operated a steamboat landing. He married, bought a farm near the town of Minden, where he lived, and was for a year bookkeeper for a large business house; afterwards became a division superintendent of education; was subsequently a clerk of the state District Court-a court of unlimited general jurisdiction; was the parish treasurer and treasurer of the school board; for a time served as a justice of the peace, worked for lawyers in making up legal accounts, prepared the collectors' tax duplicates, etc.; 'afterwards became deputy clerk, and held the latter office at the time he was called to Virginia on account of tie illness of his brother. At the time lie came toVirginia he left 'at Minden his wife and five children, all minors and the issue of the marriage, the youngest being an infant, who livedI )ut a.coiparatively short time. The names and dates of birth of the other children were as follows: Erle H., born on October 21, 1868; Wilmer, born on October 11, 1875;, Ashby, born on February 3, 1880, and Lunette, born on December 19, 1882.
Omitting reference to the controverted question as to what
passed between Silas and Thomas preceding the death of the former, certain it is that after the death of Silas there was found in a trunk belonging to him some few )ersonal effects, the will which was afterwards probated, and an envelope containing papers-the so-called list set out in the bill and referred to in the report of the auditor and in the opinion of the Court of
Appeals. On September 28, 1888, Thomas M. Turner came to Wash-
ington, and in company with Eppa Hunton, Jr., Esq., a meiber of the Virginia bar, had an interview with Tracy. Whatever took place at this interview forms, we think, one of the principal controversies of the case, and we shall have occasion

hereafter to fully advert-to it. Certain it is upon that day Turner received from Tracy in cash a little over four hundred dollars, and Turner returned to Virginia From that time (September 28, 1888) up to November 26, 1888, except a letter written by Tracy to Turner on October 10, 1888, there is nothing-in the record showing any relations between Tracy and Turner concerning the property in the hands of Tracy. On the date last named (November 26, 1888) Mr. Hunton offered the will of Silas H. Turner for probate in the County Court of Fauquier County; a commission was issued to take the testimony of Tracy aid the other attesting witness to the will, and the commission was executed on November 28, in the city of Washington, immediately taken to Warrenton, and on the same day the will was admitted to probate.
The next day, after the probate of the will, Turner ap-
peared in Washington and called upon Tracy. Tracy handed to Turner a list of the notes, cash and Other property in his possession, which he proposed to turn over as belonging to the estate of Silas H. Turner. Turner took the list and examined it overnight, returned the next morning, received the notes and the additional cash mentioned in the receipt, and as to a piece of real estate specified in the list received the following certificate from Tracy:
"I hereby certify that I have invested three thousand six hundred dollars ($3,600.00) in.. ground on Maryland avenue between 9th and 10th streets N. E., at thirty-five cents per square foot, and that Silas H. Turner is entitled to one-half. of the proceeds derived from the sale of the same, after deducting the cost of grading, subdividing and examining titles, etc.
"PHILIP A. TRAcY." The entire question of fraud on the part ofTracy depends upon the statements of Turner as to what took place between himself and Tracy when he gave the foregoing receipt, and as to the conduct of the latter concerning the so-called list which

has been previously refeired to. This we shall consider when we come to the controverted questions.
At the suggestion of Tracy the notes covered by Turner's full receipt were placed in a bank at Washington for collection, Tracy introducing Turner to the bank and assisting him in opening the account. Turner went to Virginia, with some of the cash received paid the funeral expenses and the debts of his brother, took his sister and a niece with him to Louisiana, and from Louisiana he went to Texas with his family and also with the sister and niece just referred to. In Texas, Turner ,bought a lot in a town called Vernon, boarded his family until he built and furnished a house, bought and partially paid for a ranch consisting of six hundred and forty acres and equipped it with stock and inachinery. In the summer of 1890. he brought this entire family to Virginia, leaving his son Erle H., who had then become of age, on the farm in Texas as manager. lie bought, in his own name,. a house and lot in Front Royal Virginia, the possession of whichli he turned over to his niece, Mrs. Rust, telling her that it was hers, and that it was done in accordance with directions given before his death by his brother Silas. Whilst in Virginia he visited Washington and saw Tracy. In the fall of 1.890 Turner went to Texas, leaving his family in Virginia. Ile remained in Texas but a short time, coming bacik to Virginia either in the late fall of 1890 or early winter of 1891. In February, 1891, he drew on the proceeds Of lie notes which had been deposited a check for the sum of forty-eight hilidred dollars and carried the money away on his person, stating in his testimony that one reason why he did so was that he did not want the heirs in Virginia to know where the property was; that he was trying to keep it concealed as nuch as he could; that he was managing his own affairs and did not want anybody to know anything about it, and that lie was trying to get the money away from Washington entirely. In April, 1891, Erie H. Turner, the son, left the farmn in Texas and came to Virginia. He visited Washington with the father, who introduced him to Tracy. The

father paid the son out of the proceeds of the notes in bank twelve hundred dollars, and delivered to him two of the notes previously turned over by Tracy, which had nbt been col-
lected, of the face value of $525. The father testified that this payment to the son was made on account of some small indebtedness which he owed the son for money received for safekeeping from him whilst a boy and in discharge of a debt which the father declared he owed the son for managing the. farm, which it had been agreed was to be compensated for by, a half. interest in the proceeds of two crops. One of the crops had been harvested and the other was still on the land and ungathered when the settlement was made.
From the date of the delivery by Tracy to Turner of the notes to the time of the payment made to Erle H. Turner, as. just stated,. all the notes delivered by Tracy to Turner and deposited to the credit of the latter had been paid, principal and interest, except the two which were turned over to Erle H.'Turner on the alleged settlement with the father. During this time the record, shows letters written by Tracy to Turner of a friendly character, advising Turner concerning the progress of the collections, and suggesting business methods for overcoming difficulties which arose, without the slightest' intimation in any of the letters that there was in Tracy's mind
even an impression of a difference between himself and Turner, or that Tracy supposed that there was any claim against him resulting from the transfer which had been made to Turner on November 30, 1888, except as indicated on the receipt then signed by Turner and the accompanying certificate relative to the Maryland avenue lots.
As the consequence of the settlement made with Erle H. Turner, practically all that remained of the money coming from the proceeds of the notes delivered by Tracy to Turner had been checked out by Turner, and it is true to say that the record leaves no question that in effect substantially all the family living and traveling expenses, the disbursements for the residence lot in Texas, the cost of the erection and the

furnishing of the dwelling, the cost of the farm and of fencing, and for stock and machinery bought for use thereon, had been defrayed out of the fund transferred by Tracy, as also the cost of the Virginia residence bought for Mrs. Rust, and various gifts of money made by Turner to nieces and nephews.
Not only during the period whilst the notes were being collected by the bank for the account of Turner and he was drawing out the proceeds-indeed up to shortly before the
bringing of this suit-Turner swore that he intentionally concealed from his wife and children, and from everybody concerned, the fact that his brother's will had been made in favor of the children, or that he had received under that will any property belonging to them. His testimony on this subject is so vital to the cause that wequote it.
On his direct examination he was interrogated and answered as follows:
"Q. You stated the other day that while you were East -in the fall of 1888, at the time of your brother's death, you wrote home to your wife during that absence? A. Yes, sir.
"Q. I want to know whether or not you told your wife in any of your letters of the fact that your brother had left an estate? A. I think I did. I am not positive.
"Q. I want you to state whether or not you told her that
he had by his will left the property to your children? A. I did not tell her that.
,Q. Was. that omission intentional or accidental? A. It was intentional, sir.
"Q. After your return to Louisiana, after your brother's
death, when did you and your family leave there? A. We left there in the summer of 1889.
"Q. Up to that time had you told anybody of the character
and contents of your brother's will? A. No one, sir, except Mr. Hunton."
On cross-examination the witness testified as follows:
"Q. Did you within a few days after signing that write to
your .wife and tell her that your brother had left his property

202 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

to you? A. I don't think I did, sir. I can't say that I did. I have no memory of writing such a thing. I may have written to her that my brother had left property to us. I .don't know what I wrote. It has been a long time, and I can't tell you.
"Q. Did you write to her in such a way as to conceal from her the truth, and intend to do so? A. I didn't intend, that my children should know the property was left to them.
"Q. Why? A. Well, sir, it was my opinion that it would not be well for thelh to know it.

"Q. When did your wife first know the terms of the will
of your brother? A. I don't know, sir. "Q. When did you first communicate to her the fact that
you had obtained the. property or the estate of your brother? A. I never conimunicated it to her, sir.
"Q. And she never knew it? A. I don't know whether she
knew it or not, but I never told her.
"Q. Do you know that she did know at any time? A. I
can't tell you, sir. I don't know that she did. "Q. Did you intentionally conceal the fact from your wife
that you had received the estate of your brother? A. I guess I did, sir, intentionally.
"Q. And never up to the present time have you ever told her that you did receive your brother's estate? A. Oh, I don't remember whether I had or not. I couldn't say positively, sir.
"Q. Have you any knowledge yourself as to the time, or any time before the bringing of this suit, when she knew that you had and had received your brother's estate? A. No, sir.
"Q. You cannot say? A. I can't say." Erle H. Turner, the son, after his introduction to Tracy,
evidently inquired from Tracy concerning the estate of Silas Turner, and he expressly declares that Tracy then informed him that the property had been left to the children, and also old him of the investment, in his hands arising from the Maryland aventue lots. It is plainly to be inferred that Ere

OCTOBER TERM, 1905.

Turner communicated this fact to his mother, and, whilst there is no direct proof as to her consequent interference, it is inferable that both the mother and the son questioned the right of Tracy to make further payments to Thomas M. Turner. Undoubtedly, shortly thereafter, Thomas M. Turner called upon Tracy to pay over the proceeds arising from the Maryland avenue lots investment, which Tracy refused to do because of legal advice which he had received, unless Turner would qualify as an administrator, which he- declined to do. It is also inferable that Erle H. Turner at that time made some demand upon the father concerning the estate, since the latter gave to him an order on Tracy for about twenty-five hundred dollars,.-delivering to the son the certificate as to the investment in real estate, which had been made by Tracy and given to Turner at the time of the transfer on November 30, 1888. Erle H. Turner (lid not return to Texas, but remained East, occasionally visiting Washington and calling upon Tracy, receiving money from him and corresponding with him from time to tinie in the most.friendly way.
Thomas M. Turner having exhafisted the proceeds of the notes which he had received from Tracy, never again 'caine in personal contact with the latter. He went to Texas, leaving his family in Virginia. In January, 1893, under a power of attorney, he sold the farm near Minden, which he had transferred in 1870 to hiswife. The expressed consideration for the sale on behalf of the wife was one thousand dollars. In January, 1894, Turner went to Virginia and took his family back to Texas. In September, 1894, Turner and his wife executed and put of record a deed conveying to Wilmer, Ashby and Lunette Turner the Texas farm, and reciting as the consideration thereof "the, sum of $6,400 to me in hand paid by Philip A. Tracy, executor of the last will and testament of my deceased brother, Silas H. Turner, in trust for the use and benefit of my children, viz., Wilmer Turner, Ashby Turner and Lunette Turner, minors, which said trust fund together with other similar trust funds was turned over to me without bonds and

DARLINGTON v. TURNER.

202 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

have been used by me for my own use and benefit, said consideration being in payment of so much of said trust fund."
It appears that the land embraced in the farm had originally been acquired by the grantor of Thomas M. Turner as school land from the State of Texas. Turner failing to pay the sixty dollars interest due on deferred payments, the land became forfeited to the State. Subsequently Turner repurchased it from the State at a reduced value, viz., one dollar per acre. In August, 1895, having previously mortgaged the dWelling house property in Vernon, Turner and his wife conveyed Said property to the mortgage creditor in cancellation of the then existing indebtedness. At about this time Mrs. Turner wrote Tracy, asking for money. Her letter is not in the record, but the reply of Tracy (c6pied in the margin 1) clearly shows that the letter was a request from Mrs. Turner to him to pay the proceeds of the Maryland avenue lots referred to in the. receipt and embraced by the certificate already referred to. A

1 Washington, D. C., Aug. 21, 1894.

Dear Mrs. Turner: I was out of the city and, therefore, did not get your

letter.until yesterday. I could not comply with your request. There is no

money in my hands belonging to the estate of S. H. Turner.

After you and Erie raised a fuss because he had not gotten his share, I

became alarmed and consulted a lawyer, and he advised me not to turn over

another dollar of the estate money until Mr. Turner qualified for the full

amount of the estate.. I informed your husband of the fact, and he de-

clined to qualify (the bond would be over $50,000) and he and Erle agreed

that I should invest the money so that it might be earning something while

in my hands.

I then invested the money in what was then good real estate paper, but

the panic cane on last year, the endorser of the notes failed in business,

and the land has depreciated in value, so that if it were sold now I do not

think it would bring half the amount of the notes. I have over $1,400 of

my money in the same land. If times should ever get good again (which

I doubt) the land would be ample security for the notes. I have let Erie have some $600 of my funds since I invested the estate money, but I can-

not see my way clear to increase the amount in such times as these. I was surprised at his coming North, without money, in such times as these.

He and his father knew the condition of the estate money, and I had twice

advised him not to come until times got better. ie told me he had over

$2,000 loaned out in Vernon, and that fter July he would have money.

Yours truly, etc.,

letter written by Tracy to Mrs. Turner five months afterwards manifests his kindly interest in the welfare of the family and renders greater the certitude that no thought was in Tracy's mind that the parties deemed that he had perpetrated a fraud upon them or that they had any claim upon him otherwise than in respect of the Maryland-avenue lots investment. And this is entirely corroborated by the intimate and friendly letters written by Erle Turner to Tracy up to a short period before his death, which shows clearly that Erle Turner considered that Tracy was accountable only for the lots referred to, and that he, Erle Turner, had received more than his share of the same. One of such letters-omitting purely irrelevant matter -is copied in the margin.'
Evidently, in consequence of the legal advice given him at the time objection was made by Erle Turner and his mother to the payment of 'the proceeds of the Maryland avenue lots to the husband and father, Tracy, as his health became impaired, grew to have an anxiety concerning the technical legality of the transfer of property which he had made to Thomas M. Turner, as shown by the receipt of November 30, 1888; and as a consequence he had prepared the statement on that subject produced by his executors. From 1895 until the death of Tracy in June, 1898, the record does not contain even the slightest proof tending to show any demand made upon Tracy or a suggestion of liability concerning the fraud and wrong charged in the bill in this case. That bill, as we have seen, was only filed in1899, after the death of Tracy.
In March, 1901, Thomas M. Turner, as shown by his testi-

mony, sold the Texas farm. The following is a statement made by Turner of the amount claimed to have been realized and the disposition made by him of such proceeds:
"I sold the place, and the consideration was $5,000. There was a deed of trust for $400 on the property, which the purchaser assumed. I owed the purchaser $205. That from the $5,000 left $4,395. I paid $200 in debts from that, which left $4,195. I owed my wife her home in Louisiana that I sold in 1893, I believe $1,000, and eight years' interest at 10 per cent, which is the legal rate in Texas. That made $1,800. I used of my wife's individual money, about the year 1870, $200. Interest on that to the present time would make 'altogether $680. That would be $2,480 that I paid my Wife, that was due her. That left $1,715. I owe about $100 in small debts there that I will have to pay out of that, which would leave $1,615 now that is community property between myself and my wife. According to the laws of Texas she would be entitled to half of it and I half. I have that much in money."
Explaining why he appropriated for his own and his wife's benefit the proceeds of the sale, to pay his alleged debt, despite the conveyance of the farm previously made by himself and wife to the minor children, Turner declared that while it was the same farm yet that it had become forfeited to the State and he had reacquired it and regarded it as community property belonging to himself and his wife, although the money which had been originally used in buying and improving the farm had come from the proceeds of the estate of his brother and belonged to. the children.
With these facts in mind we come more directly 'to consider the fraud alleged to have been committed by Tracy at the time he made the transfer of property and took the -receipt of Thomas M. Turner. The principal ground upon which the auditor and both courts below rested their conclusion that Tracy had been guilty of such fraud was a discrepancy which it was assumed existed between a so-called list in Tracy's handwriting of notes in his hands,- which list had been found

among the effects of Silas H. Turner at his death, and the correctness of which it was concluded was acknowledged by Tracy to Thomas M. Turner after the death of Silas H. Turner. In approaching the question of fraud we bear in mind the rule that where both courts below have found a particular state of facts, we do not disregard theni except upon the conviction that the lower courts clearly erred in their conception of the weight of the evidence. Now, coming to consider the evidence in the light of this rule, we are constrained to the conclusion that the premise upon which the courts below acted, that is, the existence of a list of notes left by Tracy, is without any support in the evidence, and, indeed, rests but upon a mere mistaken assumption.
True it is that an envelope was found among the papers of Silas H. Turner with an indorsement upon it in the handwriting of Tracy, reading as follows: "Notes belonging to S. H. Turner, 1888." True also is it that two sheets of paper were produced with memoranda of notes upon each in the handwriting of Tracy. But to assume that these two sheets were one list made by Tracy and possessed as one list by Turner at the time of his death is to disregard the uncontroverted fact that the two separate sheets did not in and of themselves, as they existed at the death of Silas H. Turner, necessarily import that they constituted a single document. To treat them as such a document would oblige us to disregard the uncontradicted testimony of Thomas M. Turner that he brought the two papers together so as to cause them to appear to be one after the death of Tracy, that he placed on the first sheet the pencil footing and the line above the same and on the second the carrying forward of the same footing as also the new footing and the line above the same, by which alone on the face of the sheets apparent unity was produced between them. We copy in the margin the two sheets, with the

additions which, as above stated, were made after the death of Silas H. Turner.
So far as the face of these sepArate sheets as they stood at the death of Silas H. Turner indicate, they do not at all exclude the implication that the items on the second sheet were but the statement of reinvestinents made by Tracy of money coming into his hands as the result of the payment to him of notes which Wvcre enumerated on the first sheet. Nor on the face of the papers does the fact that an envelope wasproduced with the words in the handwriting of Tracy written thereon "Notes belonging to S. t. Turner, 1888," necessarily give rise to a contrary deduction. For, nQn constat but that this envelope was marked by Tracy on delivering to Silas H.

the first sheet exhibiting the property in the hands of Tracy at the beginning of the year 1888. When the course of business between the parties as stated by Tracy in the memorandum addressed to his executors is recalled, the greater probability is not only that the two sheets were not received by Silas H. Turner at one time, bu't that the second sheet was a mere memorandum of investments of items stated on the first sheet. The mode of dealing as stated by Tracy was this: He kept the notes belonging to Turner in an envelope. Periodically he would send a general statement to Turner, and when sufficient money was in his (Tracy's) hands arising from accumulations of interest or paymentof a note, he would reinvest and send or give Turner a memorandum of the new investment. Now the condition of the first sheet justifies the presumption that it related to a general statement of the investments in the hands of Tracy at the end of the year 1887. The notes on this sheet, although grouped in disregard of chronological order, include notes dated from 1875 to and including 1887. On the other hand, the second sheet is but an enumeration of three notes executed in 1888, the last dated on March 12. -This second sheet in no way corresponded, therefore, to a general statement between the parties, but is exactly responsive to the conception of a memorandum of reinvestments made in accordance with the custom described by Tracy. And by comparison of some of the items on the separate sheets cogency is added to the reasonable presumption that the second and separate sheet was but a statement of reinvestments made after January 1, 1888. Thus, on the first sheet is the following item: "Dec. 30, '85. John L. Carusi, 1350." Now if this note matured on December 30, 1887, and, was paid shortly after its maturity, Tracy early in January, 1888, would have had that amount for reinvestment. Looking at the second sheet we find upon it an item showing an investment of precisely the amount of the principal of the Carusi note, as follows: "Jan. 27, 1888. A. H. Nixon (3) 1350.00."

DARLINGTON v. TURNER.

202 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

As Turner and Tracy met in Washington oin April 30, 1888, and in view of the reasonable probability that Turner must have been in possession of prior general statements of the investments made by Tracy, the inference is persuasive that the memoranda embraced on the second sheet may have been delivered by Tracy to Turner at that time.
It is insisted that as Thomas M. Turner testified that he exhibited th6 two sheets as one paper to Tracy, and that Tracy told him that he had all of the notes described on both of the sheets in his possession and that they were "as good as gold," therefore the sheets were proven to be one and tile liability of the estate of Tracy to account on that hypothesis was established. But in view of the state of the uncontroverted proof which we have previously noticed concerning Turner and his acts of omission and commission, we are constrained to the conclusion that he has so discredited himself as to make it impossible for us to accept his uncorroborated statements as establishing the alleged fraud and dishonesty of Tracy; although in reaching this conclusion we do not exclude the possibility that Turner may have harbored a suspicion that Tracy had not fully accounted, and communicated his suspicions to others. And even putting out of view the acts of commission and omission of Turner and the consequent inability to rely upon his testimony as to the commission by Tracy of the alleged fraud, the unexplained failure of the complainants to make certain proof, and the proof as made, clearly demonstrate that Tracy could not have been guilty of the fraud charged against him, and we under separate headings state our reasons for this conclusion.
1. The interview between Tracy and Turner, at which the alleged admission by Tracy was made concerning the list and his possession of all the notes shown on the two sheets, was the one had a week after the death of Silas H. Turner, at which Thomas M. Turner testifies that TyIr. Hunton, his counsel, was
present and heard the alleged statement made by Tracy. Yet

OCTOBER TERM, 1905.

202 U. S.

the testimony of Mr. Hunton was not taken. Besides, the bill contained an express averment that the land records of the District of Columbia established that the notes embraced on the first sheet which were omitted from the receipt signed by Turner had been paid after the death of Silas H. Turner, but no proof on that subject was offered. On the contrary, it was stipulated on the taking of evidence that five of the notes which were on the first sheet had been paid and the releases of trust executed after March 12, 1888, the date of the oldest executed note shown on the second sheet of the list, and before the death of Silas H. Turner, a fact which clearly rebuts the presumption that Tracy could have admitted to Turner on September 28, 1888, that he possessed notes which were good as gold, although they were not then in existence.
2. The face of the receipt itself (which is copied in the margin),' considered in the light of the uncontroverted facts

Opinion of the Court.

which we have stated, and other circumstances to which we shall advert, we think equally rebut the statements of Turner as to the alleged admissions of Tracy. It will be observed that the aggregate of both sheets of the so-called list was $28,972.10. The notes embraced upon the receipt given by Turner aggregated $22,802.50, a difference between the two footings of $6,169.60. Now, admitting that the two items of cash payments figuring in the receipt, amounting to $776.89, may be treated as interest, besides the notes, the receipt of Turner specified an investment of eighteen hundred dollars in the Maryland avenue lots, for which at the time Tracy delivered to Turner the certificate to which we have referred in stating the uncontroverted facts, and which Turner turned over to his son Erle. Deducting this eighteen hundred dollars, which Tracy admitted he owed, left only a difference of $4,369.60. How, under this condition of things, it could be found that Tracy admitted he was appropriating for his own benefit morethan six thousand dollars we cannot conceive, since on the face of the transaction, under the most favorable view of the testimony for the complainants, Tracy was paying over or acknowledging his liability for everything but about four thousand dollars of notes. And yet more incredible does the theory of a fraudulent retention of over six thousand dollars by Tracy become when it is considered that Tracy permitted Turner to retain what would have been conclusive evidence of his fraud if the theory of the previous admissions of Tracy as to one list and its correctness,, propounded by the complainants and found by the courts below, were true.

enough to conceive the spoliation which is charged to have been committed by him, it would be certainly fair enough to presume that he would have exercised reasonable precautions to destroy the evidence of his wrongdoing.
Moreover, a comparison of the receipt with the two sheets supports the conviction that the second sheet was but a statement of: reinvestments, and therefore that it was impossible that Tracy should have admitted that he was in fact stealing from or denying his liability to the estate of his dead friend in respect to the sum which he was either actually paying over or admitting his responsibility for. Now, the receipt embraced all of the notes mentioned on the second sheet, aggregating $4,850. It embraced certain notes found on the first sheet, aggregating $11,600. The receipt also embraced notes not appearing on the first sheet-in other words, replacing those omitted (and included the Maryland avenue lots)indicating by their dates that they were acquired after the date of the last investment appearing on the second sheet of the list, viz., March 12, 1888, and after April 30, 1888, when Silas Turner was in the office of Tracy and made his will. These last items aggregated $8,152.50. The total of the various items footed up $24,602.50. Now, this sum was slightly in excess of the notes shown on the first of the two sheets of the so-called list, going to demonstrate that the settlement between the parties was based, not upon any deduction of an impossible sum of six thousand dollars, but upon the fact that the second sheet represented reinvestments of items appearing on the first sheet. And the cogency of this conclusion becomes manifest when it is considered that there is not an iota of evidence tending to show where Tracy could have gotten the money to invest in the notes which he turned over, acquired after March 12, 1888, unless it was from collections of the notes appearing on the first sheet of the so-called list, which, in consequence of their payment, were represented in the receipt by the new investments. 3. That at the time the receipt was given there was some

conversation on the subject of a probable charge by Tracy for his services rendered to Silas H. Turner, we think persuasively appears. In May, 1892, after the refusal of Turner to qualify as administrator of the estate and the refusal of Tracy to turn over the proceeds of the Maryland avenue lots to Turner unless he did qualify, Tracy wrote Turner aletter which is copied in the margin.'
It is true that Turner, in producing the letter, whilst acknowledging its receipt, declared that it*was the first he had ever heard of any such charge or intention to charge; but Turner in no way intimates that he took issue with Tracy, by letter or otherwise, concerning the right of Tracy to make the charge, a line of conduct wholly inexplicable if the theory of a fraudulent retention by Tracy of six thousand dollars had foundation in fact. Having regard to the context of Tracy's letter we consider it as implying an intention to deduct for the benefit of the sister of Silas H. Turner the sum of the charge which Tracy. had made or then proposed to make from the proceeds of the investment remaining in his hands. And we

Dear Turner: I wrote you some time ago, but have not received any reply

may remark in passing that there is proof tending to show that Tracy subsequently made remittances to the sister in question.
4. As we have said in stating the uncontroverted facts, Turner came from Louisiana to the house of Mrs. Rust, where his brother Silas was lying dangerously ill, about a month and
a half before the death of Silas. The proof leaves no doubt that whilst there he frequently met his niece, Mrs. Rust, and other Virginia relatives, and had ample occasion to be aware of their frame of mind. There is no proof whatever showing that Tracy, whose home was in Washington, had any connection whatever with the Virginia relatives of Silas Turner, or was in a position to form an opinion concerning the probable
conduct of those relatives as to a contest of the will of Silas Turner. And yet Turner swears that one of the principal causes of his yielding to the fraud of Tracy was the danger which Tracy persuaded Turner would arise in consequence of the purpose of the Virginia relatives to contest the will. Further, although the first interview between Tracy and Turner after the death of Silas was on September 28, 1888, the settlement between Turner and Tracy was not had until more than two months thereafter, viz., November 30, 1888. Now the only explanation Turner gives for this delay is that Tracy told him at the interview on September 28, 1888, that he was about to absent himself on a two weeks' leave and upon his return would inform Turner and they would have a settlement, a reason wholly inadequate to explain the long delay between that and the next meeting; That Tracy expected to. make a settlement and desired to keep in touch with Turner is -shown by a letter written to Turner on October 10, 1888, from Old Point Comfort, advising Turner of his (Tracy's) whereabouts. Several of the Virginia relatives who were in contact with Turner during the considerable interval which elapsed between the first visit of Turner to Tracy and the final settlement testified to statements made in their presence by Turner, that he was awaiting the nhcessary papers from Louisiana showing his authority to represent his children, and that just before Turner

DARLINGTON v. TURNER.

202 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

went 'to Washington to make the settlement with Tracy, Turner stated to them that he had the required authority. This shows that the matter of Turner's right to represent his children was, in all probability, the cause of the long delay in making the settlement, and is corroborated by a passage contained in a letter written by Turner to his daughter Wilmer in 1899, in which communication, referring to the occurrences at the final settlement with Tracy, Turner said:
"Tracy then informed me that as my brother owed no debts there was no use to have an administration; that he would not qualify as executor of the will, and that I need not delay to be appointed guardian for my children; that he would turn the notes over to me and I could place them in bank to be collected as they matured."
True it is that Turner testified that the words which he affixed to his name in signing the receipt describing his representative capacity, viz., "Natural tutor and agent for my minor children," were dictated by Tracy, but in view of the probable ignorance of Tracy of the Louisiana law and the experience and familiarity which Turner possessed on that subject, the statement cannot be accepted as true.
Considering all the evidence, our conclusion is that the proof not only completely fails to establish the commission of fraud or wrong by Tracy, but that on the contrary it clearly shows honesty and fair dealing on his part. Indeed, so far as concerns the transfer of property made to Thomas M. Turner without provoking an administration either in Virginia or in the District of Columbia,. whatever may be its legal consequence, which we shall hereafter consider, we think the clear preponderance of the proof gives rise to the inference that that payment was made without administration because of Tracy's' knowledge that there were no debts and because of the representations made by Turner that he was entitled under the law of Louisiana to receive the transfer on behalf of his minor children, and that if it were not made to him without legal proceedings there would be much unnecessary expense resulting

from a contest, and thus the purpose of the testator towards the beneficiaries of his will would be in part frustrated..
This brings us to consider the proposition of law whether the payment by Tracy to Thomas M. Turner, as the representative of his children, was adequate to prevent the estate of Tracy from being compelled to pay a second time.
It is undoubted that at the time of Silas H. Turner's death the children who were, the beneficiaries under his will were minors and were domiciled with their father and mother, who were both alive and residing in the State of Louisiana. It is at once conceded that under the law of Louisiana a father or mother entitled to qualify as natural tutor (guardian) must be recognized by a court, and as a condition precedent to such recognition must have complied with the requirements.of the law. Under the law of Louisiana such precedent requirements are the taking of the inventory, the recording of an
abstract thereof and an oath of office. As it is established that Thomas M. Turner performed none of these requirements and was never recognized by a court as the natural tutor of his children, it is insisted that he was wholly without power to represent them or to receive the bequests made to them by the will of Silas H. Turner. But the proposition is inapposite and is based upon a misconception of the law' of Louisiana resulting from the assumption that under that law the rules governing the qualification and appointment of natural tutors after the death of one of the spouses applies to the case of a father during marriage representing and acting for and on behalf of his minor children.
In the Civil Code of Louisiana of 1870, title 7, chapter 5, treating of father and child, it is provided as follows:
"ART. 221. The father is, during the marriage, adminis-
trator of the estate of his minor children. "He is accountable. both for the property and revenues of
the estates, the use of which he is not entitled to by law, and for the property only of the estates, the usufruct of which the law gives him.

DARLINGTON v. TURNER.

202 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

"This administration ceases at the time of the majority or emancipation of the children."
And in the same title and chapter it is further provided: "ART. 223. Fathers and mothers shall have, during marriage, the enjoyment of the estate of their children until their majority or emancipation." Moreover, in the same chapter, it is also provided: "AnT. 226. This usufruct shall not extend to any estate, which the children may acquire by their own labor and industry, nor to such estate as is givn or left them under the express condition that the father and mother shall not enjoy such usufruct." Thes? provisions of the Code of 1870 have obtained in that State from an early date. The first of them was in the Code of 1825 as article 267, under the title treating of minors and their tutorship, and under -the same title the provision was contained in the Code of 1808 in section 2 of Title 8, article 5. And as the inevitable result of these provisions of the code it has long been settled in Louisiana that the plenary power of the father as administrator, during marriage, of the estate of his minor children, born of the marriage, was wholly distinct from tutorship, did not depend upon previous judicial recognition, and was not subjected to the precedent requirements essential to give rise to tutorship. In Cleveland, Tutrix, v. Sprowl, Administrator (1845), 12 Rob. 172, the court said (p. 173): "Now, it is well known, that no tutorship exists, during the marriage, over the children issued from it, but that a child remains under the authority of his father and mother until -his majority or emancipation. Civ. Code, Art. 234. "The father is, during the marriage, administrator of the estate of his minor children; he is accountable both for the property and revenues of the estates, the use of which he is not entitled: to by law, and for the property only of the estates, the usufruct of vhich the law gives him; and such administration ceases at the time of the majority or emancipation of the

children. Art. 267. The natural tutorship only takes place after the dissolution of the marriage, by the death of either of the spouses, and belongs of right to the surviving one. Art. 268. Thus it is clear, that the legal mortgage resulting from
the tutorship, is not applicable to the administration of the minor's property, given by law to the father, during the marriage. He is not a tutor; his duties and responsibilities are very different; and the law does not appear to have intended, that while the minor's estate remains under his father's administration during the marriage, his child should have a legal mortgage upon his father's property, as a security for the said administration."
As a result, it was expressly decided that neither the legal mortgage resulting from tutorship nor the security generally required by law from usufructuaries were applicable to a father -as administrator of the estates of his minor children during the marriage. Our attention has not been called to nor have we been able to find any decision of the Supreme Court of Louisiana modifying in the slightest degree the principles thus announced. On the contrary, in Gates v. Renlroe (1852), 7 La. Ann. 569, whilst the subject was notdirectly at issue, the court in its opinion assumed the "lawof Louisiana concerning the power of the father in administering the estates of his minor children, as previously stated, to be element-
ary. It is certain that the article relating to the power of the
father to administer during marriage, which was originally enacted in the Code of 1808, was drawn from the Code Napoleon. We say this is certain, because not only did the article as enacted in the Codes of 1808 and 1825 exist in the Code Napoleon in absolutely identical words, but it was also in that code placed, as it was in the two earlier Louisiana codes, under the heading of minors and their tutorship. Code Napoleon, Art. 389.
The fact that the provision should more properly have been
classed under the chapter of the code treating of paternal

authority has been recognized in France. In commenting, upon this subject Demolombe says (vol. 6, No. 409):
"It is evident that this article appropriately belongs to the title treating of paternal power, because during the marriage tutorship does not exist. It is alone in virtue of the paternal power that the father (or the mother in the case of the father's incapacity) is charged with the administration of the goods belonging to his minor children."
The same commentator thus expounds the spirit of the article (Ib. No. 415):
"During the marriage the father and the mother are present and codperating with each other, consulting with each other, supervising as it were each other With that instinctive tenderness which is the result of their relation to their. offspring. This the law assumes to be an assured and certain security for the children founded at the same time upon both paternal and conjugal affection, of which the children are the pledge, and of which they are the most potent links for the perpetuation of the union. . . . Let us add that the conflicts between interests of the children and those of the parent which often arise from the death of one of the parents do not usually exist whilst both the parents are alive. These are the family considerations upon which the article is founded, and tradition plainly confirms them. Thus in our ancient jurisprudence the distinction between the legal administration of a father and tutorship was well established. The first rested upon an agency created by law alone, based upon the confidence which the law reposed in paternal affection, from which it resulted that the powers of administration given to the father were broader and more comprehensive than those which the law conferred upon a tutor. (Comp. Merlin, Rep. VII, V0 L~gitime Administration; Coquille, sur l'art 2, de la Coutume de Niver-
nais, de Lauri~re sur Loisel Inst. Cout. livre 1, titre IV, r~gle 1.)" And when the genesis of the enactment which passed from
the Napoleon Code into the codes of Louisiana is considered the accuracy of the observations of the commentator just cited

OCTOBER TERM, 1905.

Opinion of the Court.

202 U. S.

is made clear. In the draft of the Napoleon Code which was first submitted the provision- subsequently contained in arti-' cle 389 of that .code was not found. The enactment of the article into the code was, the result of a recommendation by the Tribunat, its report on, the subject expressly saying (Locr6. Legislat. Civ. t. VII, p. 215):
"We think that the first article of the chapter should express in precise terms what during the marriage should be the authority of the father over the personal goods-of his minor children. . . . Never up to this time has it been exacted that a father should be obliged to qualify as the tutor of his children before the dissolution of the marriage. If while the marriage exist the law did not make a distinction between the father and mother and a tutor in the proper sense of the word, it would follow that the father Would be as to the personal goods of his minor children subjected during marriage to all tne conditions and burdens which the law imposes upon a tutor. The father would then be as to his minor children under the supervision of an under tutor, would depend upon the advice of a family meeting, etc., etc., all of which would be repugnant to the accepted conceptions. of paternal authority. It seems fitting that up to the dissolution of marriage the only title which the father should have is that of administrator, and it is for this reason that we recommend the adoption of the article."
And the views which were thus expounded have been substantially applied by the decided dises in France, and are concurred in by the practically unanimous opinion of the theoretical writers. The result of those decisions and the opinions of the writers on the subject adequately portray the plenary power conferred upon the father as the administrator of all the property of his minor children during marriage and the distinction' between that authority and the narrower power as' to the natural tutorship arising only.aftr the dissolution of
the marriage. The authorities will be found exhaustively collected in the notes to article 389 of the Napoleon Code in

DARLINGTON v. TURNER.

202 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

the Fuzier-Herman edition of that code, published at Paris in 1885.
Much reliance in argument is placed upon the terms of article 3350 of the Louisiana Code of 1870, which reads as follows:
"ART. 3350. Before fathers and mothers, who by law are entitled to the usufruct of property belonging to their minor children, shall be allowed to take possession of such property and enjoy the fruits and revenues thereof, they shall cause an inventory and appraisement to be made of such property, and
cause the same to be recorded in the mortgage book of every parish in the State where they or either of them have immovable property."
This article was not contained in any of the previous codes. Its origin is this: Prior to the Louisiana Constitution of 1868 the moneyed obligations of natural. tutors towards their minor children, of husbands to their wives, and some other pecuniary obligations expressly provided for by law, were secured by what was known to the Louisiana law as legal and tacit mortgages. Those mortgages existed by operation of law and without registry. No such provision, however, ever obtained, as we have seen, concerning a father administering upon the estate of his minor children during the marriage. The Louisiana constitution of 1868 (art. 123), provided that all legal, tacit mortgages should cease after a specified date, and expressly imposed upon the legislature the duty of providing by law for a mode of registry in order to preserve existing and future mortgages of that character. By an act passed in 1869, entitled an act to carry out this article of the constitution and "to provide for recording all mortgages and privileges," the legislature sought to comply with this constitutional direction. Acts La. 1869, p. 114. The act in question contained specific directions for recording mortgages of the character referred to, the mode of registry which was adopted as to these mortgages being the making of an abstract of an inventory showing the amount of the minor's property, and the putting of the same of record. Section 12, the last section

OCTOBER TERM, 1905.

Opinion of the Court.

202 U. S.

of the act, contained the exact provision subsequently embodied when the Code of 1870 was adopted, in article 3350, except that section 12 of the act of 1869, moreover, had these words, which are not found in the article of the code referred to: "Which recordation shall operate a mortgage on such property until a final settlement of the administration of said property." In other words, when the Code of 1870 came to be adopted the compilers omitted the words of section 12 of the act of 1869 just quoted, but placed in the code the remainder of the section providing for the registry of an abstract of the inventory in the case stated. It is difficult to determine, exactly the reason which impelled the compilers of the Code of 1870 to omit the provision as to mortgages found in section 12 of the act of 1869, conceding that that provision was constitutional despite the title of the act, and to reenact the remainder of the section providing for the registering of an abstract of an inventory in the case named, since by the omission of the provision as to mortgage no possible security could arise from the recording of an abstract of an inventory in the case provided for. For, certain it is that neither under the codes as they existed prior to 1870, nor in that code, was or is there any provision for a legal mortgage securing the minors against loss, resulting from the enjoyment by either parent during marriage of a usufruct. The intention of the compilers of the Code of 1870 not to. change the powers of administration of the property of his minor children, conferred upon the father by the prior codes, is expressly shown by the re~naftment without change of those provisions, and is cogently exemplified by the further fact that in reenacting the provisions in question they were removed from the chapters of the code referring to tutorship and were transferred to the chapters of the code relating to paternal authority. As the full significance to be given to article 3350 is a question of local Louisiana law, which we are not called to decide, except so far as is essential to the determination of the case before us, we content ourselves with saying that we think it is clear that that

DARLINGTON v. TURNER.

Opinion of the Court.

article in no way modifies or controls the full power of the father to administer during marriage the estates of his minor children, so well settled under the Louisiana law., In any event, We think that article 3350 simply implies that unless an inventory is made and an abstract recorded the usufruct which otherwise would exist shall not obtain. But giving this effect to the article in no way.modifies the powers of administration conferred upon the father during marriage to which we have referred, because, as clearly pointed out by the authorities which we have previously cited, the administration is wholly. independent of the usufruct and applies to the minor's property during marriage, whether or not there be a right of usufruct.
As then by the law of their domicil the minors were represented by their father as administrator, with full power under that law to receipt for and administer the property for their account, was the transfer of property made by Tracy in the District of Columbia to Thomas M. Turner, as the administrator or representative of his-minor children, valid and binding? It is said that it was not because Turner, the testator, was domiciled in Virginia, and if the property had been administered upon in that jurisdiction, never mind what was the power of the father, under the law of Louisiana he would not have been entitled to receive or remove the property from the jurisdiction without an order made by a Virigina court and upon the giving of satisfactory security. But the property in question was in the District .of Columbia, and in the absence of all showing that there were creditors in Virginia, the Probate Court of the District of Columbia would have had power under the circumstances disclosed, if administration had been had in the District, to direct the delivery of the property to the person lawfully entitled to represent the minors, without compelling the transmission of the funds to Virginia. Under these circumstances, we are of opinion that the payment in the District of Columbia to the father of the complainants as administrator of their estate, fully empowered to collect and

receive the same by the law of their domicil, is controlled by the cases of Wilkins v. Ellett, 108 U. S. 256; S. C., 9 Wall. 740. It is, however, urged that although as a general principle the cases referred to are decisive of this, the terms of the will and the knowledge which Tracy had of the intentions of the testator, made the delivery by Tracy to the father of the children a violation of the terms of the will and operated a fraud upon the rights of the children, which, it is claimed, takes this case out of the general rule. The unsoundness of the first of these contentions, which rests upon the terms of the will, we think ,is demonstrated by its mere statement. The proposition is that the words of the will "and appoint Philip A. Tracy to distribute the proceeds of said property equally between them" (the minor children of Thomas M. Turner) implied a direction to Tracy to hold and administer the property for the benefit of the children, and not to pay it over to a lawfully appointed administrator or to one legally authorized to receive it. The second contention rests upon the assumption that as a matter of fact the proof establishes that Tracy had knowledge that the purpose of Silas H. Turner in making his will was to exclude the administration by Thomas M. Turner of the property bequeathed to his children, because Thomas M. Turner was a spendthirift and the testator lacked confidence in him. And this assumption of fact, as we have seen, was adopted by the trial court. Conceding for the sake of argument only that the existence of such knowledge on the part of Tracy would have caused it to be a fraud for him to turn over the property to the lawful administrator of .the minors, we can find no reliable proof whatever in the record justifying the premise of fact upon which .the contention is based. The sole .and only possible basis for such an assufmption is a statement made by Erle H. Turner in the course of his examination-in-chief, where, in purporting to give his recollection of a conversation had with Tracy, he said:
"Tracy himself wrote the will; and he said that he had suggested to uncle to. leave it to my father, and if I remember,

DARLINGTON v. TURNER.

202 U. S.

Opinion of the 'Court.

his answer was no, he would spend it, or something like that; and then he suggested that he leave it to his children, and that idea suited uncle, and he wrote the will."
We shall not stop to point out the conflict between this statement made by Erle Turner and the intimate and friendly relations as exhibited by his correspondence, cQntinuing almost up to the time of the death of Tracy, or the conflict between the statements and the various parts of his testimony and his letters. We do not pause to do these things, because in our opinion the proof introduced by both parties beyond question establishes that Silas H. Turner entertained no such feeling towards his brother as the quoted testimony of Erle Turner implies. Thus the complainants' own proof showed that Thomas M. Turner was summoned to the bedside of his dying brdther and there remained for a month and a half; that during that time he was in constant and close relation with the brother, without the slightest iitimation of any want of confidence between them. On the contrary, Thomas M. Turner nie repeated statements and declaration in the course of his testimony, to the effect that his brother referred to the will, and informed him that he expected him to administer the property, etc. That Tracy regarded Thomas M. Turner as honest is demonstrated by his whole course of conduct, and is illustrated by his allusions to Thomas M. Turner in the memorandum which he left for-the information of his exec-
utors. The receipt being binding, the only question remaining for
consideration is whether any liability rests upon the estate of Tracy growing out of the investment in real estate referred to therein. From an inspection of the receipt it will be seen that that subject was thus described: Lots on Maryland avenue N. E. $1,800; and as we have also previously'stated at the time of the giving of the receipt Tracy delivered to Thomas M. Turner a certificate, which we have heretofore reproduced; and which, as we have said, Turner subsequently turned over to his son Erle.

OCTOBER TERM; 1905.

Opinion of the Court.

202 U. S.

The evidence shows that the investment in question was represented by shares of stock of the Mutual Investment Company, which had acquired square 937 in the city of Washington. On September 3, 1888, Tracy subscribed to twentyfive shares of the stock of the par value of $150 per share, making a total liability of $3,750. He had paid assessments aggregating only $85 per share, when, on February 6, 1890, the land, was sold at a profit of sixty dollars on each share of stock. It may, of course, be presumed that during the interval between the subscription to the stock and the winding ,up of the venture Tracy retained possession of the balance, upon which he was liable on the subscription over and above the sums actually paid on assessment calls, so as to be ready to respond to calls up to the par value of the stock. Twelve of the subscribed shares would represent an investment of $1,800, the exact amount stated in the receipt. The profit on the twelve shares amounted to $720. This profit with the principal of the investment aggregated, therefore, on February 6; 1890, $2,520. Tracy, however, received but a trifling amount in cash, the greater part of the sum due him on the settlement being paid in notes of the purchaser of square 937, secured by trust deed. When the notes were paid, as shown in a letter written by Tracy to T. M. Turner on May 7, 1892, heretofore reproduced in the margin, the investment had realized $2,600. On account of the refusal of Tracy in the spring of 1891 to pay over this sum to Thomas M. Turner, then living in Texas, unless he qualified as administrator of the estate, Tracy invested the amount in real estate notes, which were in Tracy's possession on May 7, 1892. Thomas M. Turner testified that prior to the spring of 1891 Tracy told him that the estate had realized from the investment in the Maryland avenue lots the sum of $2,750, although he does not claim to have taken issue with the statement in Tracy's letter that the amount was.$2,600. The auditor, however, fixed the amount at $3,069.65, and held the estate of Tracy liable to account for that sum from February 6. 1890.

DARLINGTON v. TURNER.

202 U. S. '

Opinion of the Court.

It appears from statements in the record that following the panic of 1893 payments of interest on this loan. ceased and the security became impaired, and, from passages in letters of Tracy, it may be conjectured the loan was secured by a second mortgage and a sale was had under the first mortgage, which failed to realize more than sufficient to pay the primary incumbrance. It being, however, impossible from the record to determine with precision the ultimate fate of the investment in question, and as the sum originally realized therefrom is fixed with sufficient accuracy and has not been accounted for, we think the estate of Tracy should be held liable as.of February 6, 1890, for the sum of two thousand five hundred and twenty dollars with legal interest. From this amount, however, there is to be deducted the one-fourth proportion of Erle H. Turner, as the sums admitted to have been paid to him by Tracy on account of this asset exceeded his proportion of the principal and interest. In other words, therefore, the estate of Tracy will be held accountable to complainants other than Erle H. Turner in equal proportions for the sum of eighteen hundred and ninety dollars with legal interest thereon from February 6, 1890.
The decree of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded with directions to reverse the decree of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia and to remand the
cause to that court with directions to enter a decree in conformity with this opinion. The costs in this court as well as in both the courts below are to be paid by the complainants and before distribution of the sum for which the estate of Tracy is held accountable.

MR. JUSTICE BROWN took no part in the consideration and decision of this case.
