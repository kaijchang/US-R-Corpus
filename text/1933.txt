GRISWOLD ET AL., EXECUTORS, v. HELVERING, COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT.
No. 38. Argued October 19, 20, 1933.-Decided November 6, 1933.
1. Section 402 of the Revenue Act of 1921 provides that, in determining the value of the gross estate of a decedent for the purpose of the federal estate tax, there shall be included the value at the time of his death of all property "to the extent of the interest therein held jointly or as tenants by the entirety by the decedent and any other person." Held, the inclusion, in the gross estate of a decedent who died while the provision of this section was in effect, of one-half the value of property held by him and his wife as joint tenants, though the tenancy was created prior to the effective date of the statute, was not a retroactive application of the statute. P. 58.
2. The cessation at death of decedent's interest in, and control over, half of property held with another as joint tenants presented a proper occasion for the imposition of a tax. Guinn v. Commissioner, 287 U.S. 224. P. 58.

CERTIORARI, 289 U.S. 722, to review a judgment affirming a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals, 23 B.T.A. 635, redetermining a deficiency in estate tax.

Mr. Wm.N. Haddadargued the cause, and Mr. Walter T. Fisher filed a brief, for petitioners.
Mr. Erwin N. Griswold, with whom Solicitor General Biggs and Messrs. Sewall Key and Wm.Cutler Thompson were on the brief, for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.
Section 402 of the Revenue Acd of 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 227, 277, 278, imposing an inheritance tax, provides,
"Sec. 402. That the value of the gross estate of the decedent shall be determined by including the value at the time of his death of all property,.

"(d) To the extent of the interest therein held jointly or as tenants in the entirety by the decedent and any other person, ...
The decedent died in 1923; while the foregoing provision was in effect. At the time of'his death he and his wife held as joint tenants certain real estate in Illinois, title to which vested in them by conveyance on October 5, 1909. The commissioner valued this real estate at $90,000, and included the-whole of it in the value of decedent's gross estate as being within the reach of § 402 (d). Upon appeal to the Board of Tax Appeals, that tribunal,
disapproving in part the commissioner's determination, held that the value of only decedent's one-half of the property could be included for the purposes of the tax. 23 B.T.A. 635. The circuit court of appeals affirmed.
62 F. (2d) 591.

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.

Opinion of the. Court.

290 US.

Whether this application of the statute gives it a retroactive effect is the sole question here involved; and with that we find no difficulty. Under the statute the death of decedent is the event in respect of which the tax is laid. It is the existence of the joint tenancy at that time, and not its creation at the earlier date, which furnishes the basis for the tax. By the judgment undcr review, only half of the value, that is to say, the value of decedent's interest, has been included, leaving the survivor's interest unaffected. After the creation of the joint tenancy, and until his death, decedent retained his interest in, and control over, half of the property. Cessation of that interest and control at death presented the proper occasion for the imposition of a tax. See Gwinn v. Commissioner,287 U.S. 224, and cases cited. And since that is all that is sought to be reached by the tax here in question, the complaint that the statute has been given a retroactive application obviously is without substance. The statute as applied does not lay a tax in respect of an event already past, but in respect of one 'yet to happen.
Petitioners insist that Knox v. McElligott, 258 U.S. 546, is to the contrary, but, clearly, it is not. There the tax return included the value of decedent's one-half of the jointly owned property, but did not include the value of the half which had been owned and enjoyed by the surviving joint tenant. Nevertheless, the commissioner undertook to impose a tax in respect of the value of this latter half as well. This court held that to do so was to apply the statute retroactively, and that this, under the circumstances of that case, could not be done. It did not hold, or intend to hold, that the statute was retroactive in so far as the value of the decedent's half of the joint estate was concerned. That question was not there involved. It is the only question here.
Judgment affirmed.

There is nothing in the enabling act which makes

Also, the identical provisions of the Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 32, 33; and the substantially similar ones of the Revenue Act of 1928, c. 852, 45 Stat. 791, 838, §§ 161 and 162.
In each cause the Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed the portion of the income from the trust created by the husband's will which had been paid to the widow. The trustees claimed credit therefor. The Board of Tax Appeals approved the assessments. The Circuit Courts of Appeals held otherwise.
Causes Nos. 75, 76 and 78 involve the same point of law. The undisputed facts are similar and it will suffice to state those of No. 75. The record in No. 77 presents another question and the facts there will be set out.

William B. Butterworth, resident of Pennsylvaiiia, died October 5, 1921. After certain bequests, his will gave the residue of the estate to respondents as trustees, with directions to pay the net income to the widow. She accepted under the will and surrendered the rights granted her by the state laws. During 1924 and 1925 the trustees paid her the income from the trust. The aggregate of these and antecedent payments was less than the estimated
whether distributed to them or not. Any amount allowed as a deduction under this paragraph shall not be allowed as a deduction under
paragraph (3) in the same or any succeeding taxable year.

Opinion of the Court,

value of her statutory rights in the estate. In order to
ascertain the taxable income of the trust, the respondents
claimed the right to deduct from the gross amount pay-
ments made to the widow. The Commissioner denied this and the Board of Tax Appeals approved his action. The
court below reversed the judgment.
Prior to Warner v. Walsh, 15 F. (2d) 367, United States
v. Bolster, 26 F. (2d) 760, and Allen v. Brandeis, 29 F. (2d) 363, the Commissioner ruled that distributions from
the income of a trust estate to the widow who elected to take under her husband's will in lieu of her statutory interest were taxable to her. These cases held that by relinquishment of her rights, she came to occupy the posi-
tion of the purchaser of an annuity. They decided that payments to her were not subject to taxation until her total receipts from the trust estate amounted to the value of what she relinquished-her alleged capital. Thereafter, in similar cases, the Commissioner refused to give credit to the trustee for such payments and thus the present causes arose.
We cannot accept the reasoning advanced to support
the three cases just cited. The evident general purpose of the statute was to tax in some way the whole income of all trust estates. If nothing was payable to beneficiaries, the income without deduction was assessable to the fiduciary. But he was entitled to credit for any sum paid to a beneficiary within the intendment of that word, and this amount then became taxable to the beneficiary. Certainly, Congress did not intend any income from a trust should escape taxation unless definitely exempted.
Is a widow who accepts the provisions of her husband's will and receives part or all of the income from an established trust in lieu of her statutory rights a beneficiary within the ambit of the statute? We think she is. It is unnecessary to discuss her rights or position under other circumstances. We are dealing with a tax statute and seeking to determine the will of Congress.

OCTOBER TERM, L933.

Opinion of the Court.

290 U.S.

When she makes her election the widow decides to

accept the benefits of the will with the accompanying

rights and liabilities. In no proper sense does she pur-

chase an annuity. For reasons satisfactory to herself,

she expresses a desire to occupy the position of a bene-

ficiary and we think she should be so treated.

The trustees in Nos. 75, 76 and 78 were entitled to the

credits claimed and the judgments of the courts below

therein must be affirmed.

No. 77

Calvin Pardee, a resident of Pennsylvania, died March 18, 1923. His will provided-" I also give unto my said wife an annuity of Fifty thousand Dollars ($50,000.), to be computed from the date of my decease and to be paid in advance in quarterly payments." The total amount paid by the trustees to the widow under the will during the tax years 1924 and 1925 and prior thereto did not aggregate the value of the interest to which she would have been entitled had she declined to take under the will. When computing the taxable income of the estate the trustees deducted the amounts paid to the widow, claiming credit therefor under § 219. The Commissioner's refusal to allow this was sustained by the Board of Tax Appeals. The court below ruled otherwise.
The annuity provided by the will for Mrs. Pardee was payable at all events. It did not depend upon income from the trust estate. She elected to accept this in lieu of her statutory rights. She chose to assume the position of an ordinary legatee. Section 213 (b) (3), Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 253, 267, 268, exempts bequests from the income tax there laid. Payments to Mrs. Pardee by the fiduciary were not necessarily made from income. The charge was upon the estate as a whole; her claim was payable without regard to income received by the fiduciary. Payments to her were not distribution of income;

but in discharge of a gift or legacy. The principle applied in Burnet v. Whitehouse, 283 U.S. 148 is applicable.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE HUGHES, dissenting.
I agree with the opinion of the Court in Nos. 75, 76 and 78. I am unable to agree with the opinion in No. 77. In that case, the testator created a trust for the benefit of his wife, children, and grandchildren. The income of the trust, by its express terms, was to be paid to his wife to the extent of $50,000 a year. While the payment of this annual amount was also charged on the principal of the estate, resort could not be had to the principal if the income of the trust was sufficient. Johnston's Estate, 264 Pa. 71, 76; 107 Atl. 335. The widow was in every sense of the word a beneficiary of the trust, and the amounts paid to her out of the income of the trust were paid to her as a beneficiary. These amounts were thus deductible by the trustees, under the express provision of § 219 (b) (2) of the Revenue Act of 1924, from the gross income of the trust. As to this, I think it makes no difference whether or not the widow was taxable on the amount of the income she received. The decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be affirmed.

1. In determining the value of a devise to charities of a remainder contingent upon the death without issue of a female life tenant in order that such value may be deducted from gross income in computing the federal estate tax, it is permissible to prove that before the death of the testator the life tenant became incapable of having issue, as the result of a surgical operation by which her procreative organs were removed. P. 281.
2. The ancient rule that a woman is conclusively presumed to be capable of bearing children as long as she lives, was, like other irrebuttable presumptions, a rule of expediency or policy, based upon the belief that to permit proof of the facts would result in injuries of greater consequence than the predominance of truth over error in the cases to which it applied.

3. Applicability of this presumption remains a proper subject of judicial inquiry in the light of modern knowledge and experience. Pp. 282, 285.

Solicitor General Biggs, with whom Assistant Attorney General Wideman and Mr. Paul A. Sweeney were on the
brief, for the United States. The amount subject to tax is to be ascertained as of
the date of the decedent's death. Ithaca Trust Co. v. UnitedStates,279 U.S. 151. No deduction will be allowed for a charitable bequest dependent upon a condition unfulfilled at that date. Humes v. United States, 276 U.S. 487; Regulations 37, Art. 56.
By the overwhelming weight of authority in the United States, evidence is not admissible to show that a woman, after reaching adult age, is incapable of bearing children. Whether the courts use the words "conclusive presump-
tion of law," "presumption of law," or some other expression, the result is the same, the rule being one of
substantive law rather than one governing the burden of proof or the duty of going forward with evidence.

In the following cases the presumption was discussea in connection with the determination of the intent of a testator: Ansonia Nat. Bank v. Kunkel, 105 Conn. 744; Oleson v. Somogyi, 93 N.J.Eq. 506; Florav. Anderson, 67 Fed. 182.
The presumption was also discussed in Sims v. Birden, 197 Ala. 690; State v. Lash, 16 N.J.Eq. 380.
See also 48 L.R.A. (N.S.) 865; 67 A.L.R. 538; 23 Col.L. Rev. 50.
In England the same rule has been strictly enforced in cases involving the rule against perpetuities (Jee v. Audley, 1 Cox Ch. Cas. 324; Griffiths v. Deloitte, [1926] Ch. 56), but in distributing estates the courts have been more liberal when the proof of incapacity seemed persuasive and distribution would deprive no living person, of a possible interest. In re White, [1901] 1 Ch. 57( ; Carrv. Carr,106 L.T.Rep. 753. Cf. Perkin v. Bland, 1 2 L.T.Rep. 181.
With relatively few exceptions, the courts have regarded the principle as so firmly established that departures from precedent should be prohibited, if only for the sake of certainty and uniformity. See In re Dougan, 139 Ga. 351, 355.
The cases holding that evidence can be admitted to show that a woman is in fact incapable of having issue are few. Johnson v. Beauchamp, 5 Dana 70, has not been followed in Kentucky. See May v. Bank of Hardinsburg, 150 Ky. 136. Male v. Williams, 48 N.J.Eq. 33; Riley v. Riley, 92 N.J.Eq. 465; Gowen's Appeal, 106 Pa. 288; List v. Rodney, 83 Pa. 483; Sterrett's Estate,300 Pa. 116; Miller v. Macomb, 26 Wend. 229; Bacot v. Fessenden, 130 App. Div. 819; and Whitney v. Groo, 40 App.D.C. 496, were cases involving specific performance of contracts for the sale of real estate. It can be inferred in all of them that the courts concluded that the possibil-

ity of issue being born to a woman long past the age for child-bearing was too remote to render unmarketable the title offered by the vendor.
There are two cases in which the capacity of a woman
to bear children has arisen in connection with tax matters-Farringtonv. Commissione 30 F. (2d) 915, cert.
den., 279 U.S. 873; and Guaranty Trust Co. v. Commissioner, 27 B.T.A. 550, now pending on appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Both involved the federal estate tax, and in both the presumption of capacity was held to be conclusive and irrebuttable. See also Pennsylvania Co. v. Brown, E.D.Penna., decided July .18, 1933, reported in Prentice-Hall Federal Tax Service, 1933, Vol. 1A, par. 1761.
The reasons usually given for excluding evidence of the incapacity of a woman to bear children are: (1) that the age at which ability to procreate ceases can not be ascertained with any degree of certainty; (2) that the subject is one of such delicacy that it should not be investigated in judicial proceedings; (3) that consideration of such evidence might encourage the performance of surgical operations to prevent birth of issue; and (4) that the prevailing rule tends to eliminate confusion in titles to property. See Hill v. Sangamon Loan & Trust Co., 295 Ill. 619, 621-622.
It happens that the great majority of the cases wherein the presumption has been held conclusive involved only old age or the physiological changes incident thereto, but the rule makes no distinction between incapacity due to age and incapacity due to artificial causes. In two cases testimony has been offered to show that the capacity to bear children had been terminated by medical treatment. Both involved the same surgical operation as was proved here (hysterectomy), and in both the evidence was held inadmissible. Byers v. Beddow, 106 Fla. 166; Guaranty Trust Co. v. Commissioner, 27 B.T.A. 550.

U.S. v. PROVIDENT TRUST CO.

272

Argument for Respondent.

Courts may well be reluctant to permit inquiry into matters so steeped in unceltainty as the efficacy of the various methods used to destroy child-bearing capacity.
The rule which has survived for many years should not
be discarded upon a showing of hardship in. individual.
cases.

Mr,Joseph Carson, with whom Mr. George M. Morris
was oh the brief, for respondent. Modern medical knowledge and scientific certainty
have made the rule contended for by the United States obsolete and inapplicable in this case.
No legal writer :before Littleton refers to the rule. Littleton's Tenures (1592 ed.), fol. 8; Coke on Littleton, 28; 2 Blackstone's Commentaries, 125. The comments of these writers are made in connection with estates tail for the purpose of showing that a fee tail gtneral can not become a fee tail with possibility of issue extinct and that a fee tail special arises only upon the death of one of the spouses. They appear to be the product of logicians in tenure and have an extremely remote, if any, connection with a federal estate tax dispute arising under modern American statutes. Cf. United States v. Provident Trust Co., 281 U.S. 497.
In the then state of medicine and surgery, it was impossible to determine as a fact that either the male or female was incapable of procreation,-hence the rule.
The modernity of medical knowledge is emphasized by the fact that of all the cases cited involving incapacity of a woman to bear children, it appears that only three involved surgical operations. Byers v. Beddow, 106 Fla. 166; Guaranty Trust Co. v. Commissioner, 27 B.T.A. 550; and the present case. The absence of such cases makes it evident that the chief practical difficulty in the cases which have heretofore come before the courts has been the inconclusiveness of the evidence offered.

278

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.

Argument for Respondent.

291 U.S.

That the rule has rested on ignorance and uncertainty and not on knowledge, will best be demonstrated by reading the cases cited by petitioner. In every case the char-
acter of the evidence tending to show incapacity appears -to have been considered, and the 'judgments of the courts will be seen in large measure to have been formed from the facts appearing in the evidence offered. Uncertain as to the impossibility of issue from the evidence presented, the courts have fallen back on the ancient formula as a safer guide. See Hill v. Sangamon Loan & Trust Co., 295 Ill. 619; Bowlin v. R.I. Hospital Trust Co., 31 R.I.
289. Nevertheless courts in the United States have fre-
quently recognized incapacity to bear children where the evidence was less conclusive than here. Whitney v. Groo, 40 App.D.C. 496; Johnson v. Beauchamp, 5 Dana 70; Male v. Williams, 48 N.J.Eq. 33; Gowen's Appeal, 106 Pa. 288; Bacot v. Fessenden, 130 App. Div. 819; Ansonia
NationalBank v. Kunkel, 105 Conn. 744. See also Apgar v. Apgar, 38 N.J.Eq. 549; In re Staheli, 78 N.J.Eq. 74, 77. And the British courts have, except where the property interests of living persons would be adversely affected, regularly admitted such evidence. Mackenzie v. King, 17 L.J. Ch. N.S. 488 (1848); In re White, 1 Ch. 570 (1901); Leng v. Hodges, Jac. 585 (1822); Edwards v.
Tuck, 3 De G. M. & G. 39 (1853); Brown v. Pringle, 4 Hare 124 (1845); Haynes v. Haynes, 35 L.J. Ch. 303 (1866). Moreover, in the field of law pertaining to damages for personal injury, it appears to be the universal rule that evidence will be received to show that the injury destroyed the power to have issue. This Court has in fact so held. Denver & R. G. Ry. v. Harris, 122 'U.S. 597. See also Normile v. Wheeling T. Co., 57 W.Va. 132; Sedgwick on Damages, 9th ed., vol. 1, § 41a; Partridgev. Boston & M. R. Co., 184 Fed. 211; Alabama G. S. R. Co. v. Hill, 93 Ala. 514.

Opinioii of the Court.

Petitioner relies upon a presumption, the product of the artificial reasoning necessary to round out an intricate medieval concept. With the appearance of modem abdominal surgery the ancient presumption has become a demonstrable fiction-a bar to the truth-to be continued only if overwhelmingly desirable in the public interest. No such desirability exists here.
None of the reasons underlying the frequent refusal of the courts to hold that a woman is incapable of bearing children are applicable here.
Without the evidence as to incapacity the true value of the estate for tax purposes can not be computed.
The wisdom, as a matter of public policy, of admitting evidence concerning the impossibility of issue, is not involved where the question to which the evidence goes is one of valuation by a party (the Government) not directly concerned with anything more than the size of the testa,tor's estate under the statute. It was the province of the court to pass upon the weight of all evidence pertinent to value.
It is the purpose of the statute to encourage charitable bequests (Edwards v. Slocum, 264 U.S. 61), and to require no more certainty in the evidence of value than is generally found in "human affairs" (Ithaca Trust Co. v. United States, 279 U.S. 151).
MR. JUSTICE SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The Provident Trust Company is the administrator, with will annexed, of the estate of the deceased, who died in 1921, leaving a will thereafter duly admitted to probate. Subsequent to the filing of the federal estate tax return, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue imposed an additional estate tax, amounting with interest to something over $21,000. The trust company paid the amount and filed a claim for refund of $18,404.05, on the ground

280

Opinion of the Court.

291 U.S.

that under the provisions of the will the value of the residuary estate, less the value of the life estate of the
daughter of deceased, should have been but was not allowed as a deduction from the gross estate. The commissioner rejected the claim and this action was brought.
The will, after making certain bequests, devised the remainder of the estate to the trust company, in trust to pay the income thereof to deceased's daughter during hei natural life, and upon her death to her lawful issue; and further provided that upon the death of the daughter without issue, the testator's residuary estate should be distributed among designated charitable institutions and societies-all belonging to that class of organizations, bequests to which are deductible from the gross estate under the provisions of § 403 (a) (3) of the Revenue Act of 1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1098. At the time of deceased's death, the daughter was fifty years of age. She had been in poor health and under a physician's care; and on February 9, 1914, upon medical advice, an operation was
performed removing her uterus, Fallopian tubes, and both ovaries. The court below specifically found-" The operation and removal of the organs were necessary to prevent further impairment of her health. After the operation she could not have become pregnant nor could she have given birth to a child. She died on March 12, 1927, unmarried, and without ever having given birth to a child." Following her death, a state orphans' court awarded the residue of the estate, subject to payment of transfer or inheritance taxes which might be due, to the charitable organizations named in the will.
Upon the foregoing facts, the court below held that respondent was entitled' to recover, and accordingly awarded judgment in the sum of $17,204.66. 77 Ct. Cls. 37; 2 F.Supp. 472.

U.S. v. PROVIDENT TRUST CO.

272

Opinion of the Court.

Section 403 (aL) (3), supra, so far as it is pertinent here, provides that for the purpose of determining the value of the net estate to be taxed there shall be deducted from the value of the gross estate-" (3) The amount of all bequests, . . . to or for the use of any corporation organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes..... " Article .53, Treasury Regulations 37, declares that the amount of
the -deduction in such case is the value at the date of decedent's death of the remainder interest in the money or property which is devised or bequeathed to charity. Com-, pare Ithaca Trust Co. v. United States, 279 U.S. 151. It follows that in making a deduction for that interest, the value thereof must be determined from data available at the time of the death of decedent. Compare Humes v.
United States, 276 U.S. 487, 494. The government contended in the court below, as it
contends here, that, in view of the restriction in respect of issue contained in the will, the value could not be thus determined, since the law, without regard to the fact, conclusively presumes that a woman is capable of bearing children as long as she lives; and that this presumption controls where the organs of reproduction have been completely removed and inability to bear children admits of no valid dispute, no less than where the question turns upon the circumstance of age alone, or upon conflicting evidence or medical opinions. The lower court held otherwise for the reason that the facts established, as of the (late of decedent's death, forbade any other conclusion than that the daughter was incapable of bearing children, and a presumption to the contrary could not be indulged.
The rule in respect of irrebuttable presumptions rests upon grounds of expediency or policy so compelling in character as to override the generally fundamental re-

291 U.S.

quirement of our system of law that questiOfr of fact must be resolved according to the proof. Mr. Best, writing more than ninety years ago when the force of th cle was. more strictly regarded than it has come to be since, said that modern courts of justice (that is to say, the courts of that day) were slow to recognize presumptions as irrebuttable, and were disposed to restrict rather than extend the number.
"Many presumptions," he says, "which, in earlier times, were deemed absolute and irrebuttable, have, by the opinion of later judges, acting on more enlarged experience, either been ranged among praesumptionesjuris tantism, or considered as presumptions of fact, to be made at the discretion of a jury. . . . By an arbitrary rule, to preclude a party from adducing evidence which, if received, would compel a decision in his favour, is an act which can only be justified by the clearest expediency and soundest policy; and it must be confessed that there are several presumptions still retained in this class which never ought to have found their way into it, and which, it is to be feared, often operate seriously to the defeat of justice." Best, Presumptions of Law and Fact (London, 1844), § 18.
Certainly the world has gained in experience since that was written; and the binding effect, in respect of particular situations, of the ancient rule precluding proof of facts to the end of avoiding supposed injurious results thought to be of greater consequence than the predominance of truth over error, still remains a proper subject of judicial inquiry to be made and resolved in the light of such further experience and knowledge. Compare Funk v. United States, 290 U.S. 371.
The foregoing observations are peculiarly apposite to the phase of the subject now under review; for, as suggested by counsel for respondent, the presumption here

U.S. v. PROVIDENT TRUST CO.

272

Opinion of the Court.

involved had its origin at a time when medical knowledge\ was meager, and many centuries before -the discovery of anaesthetics and, consequently, before surgical operations of the kind here involved became practicable. It was not until a comparatively recent period, therefore, that the effect of such an operation was disclosed to observation, and the incontrovertible fact recognized that a woman subjected thereto was permanently incapable of bearing children.
The government argues that the rule is one of substantive law and evidence to overcome it is inadmissible. Whether in particular instances so-called irrebuttable presumptions are, in a more accurate sense, rules of substantive law rather than crue presumptions, is a matter in respect of which a good deal has been said by modern commentators on the law of evidence. 2 Chamberlayne on Evidence, §§ 1086, 1087, 1159, et seq.; 5 Wigmore on Evidence, 2d ed., § 2492. Compare Heiner v. Donnan, 285 U.S. 312, 328-329; 2 Thayer, Evidence, 351-352, 540541, 545-546. But it is unnecessary to consider that interesting distinction, since, as will appear, the presumption in questioii in this instance must be dealt with as open to rebuttal and, therefore, in any aspect of the matter, as a true presumption.
The presumption generally has been held to be conclusive when the element of age alone is involved, albeit Lord Coke's view that the law seeth no impossibility of issue, even though both husband and wife be an hundred years old (Coke on Littleton, 551; 2 Blackstone Commentaries 125), if now asserted for the first time, might well be put aside as a rhetorical extravagance. But the presumption, even where age alone is involved, has not been universally upheld as conclusive or applied under all circumstances. It has been followed to a greater extent in this country than in England, though even here

exceptional cases are to be found; 1 and in England su( cases are very numerous.' It does not seem necessai to review the decisions in either jurisdiction. It is enougi to say that the English courts have treated the rule ,-; possessing a considerable degree of flexibility and have refused to give it a conclusive effect in a large number of cases; while the American courts, adhering to a more rigid view, have applied the rule more generally. See extended note, 67 A.L.R. 538, et seq., where the decisions are classified and digested. Few cases have arisen where elements other than, or in addition to, that-of age were present, and the conclusive character of the rule in such cases is by no means established. Thus in Hill v. Spencer, 196 Ill. 65, 70; 63 N.E. 614, the Supreme Court of Illinois held meaningless an allegation that a woman was past the age of childbearing, but was careful to add, " unless more than a mere matter of age is stated in the bill." See Denver & R. G. Ry. v. Harris,supra, note 1. And speaking generally this court has said, Lincoln v. French, 105 U.S. 614, 616-617-" But all presumptions as to matters of fact, capable of ocular or tangible proof, such as the execution of a deed, are in their nature disputable. No conclusive character attaches to them.. They may always be rebutted and overthrown."
The basis for the interposition of an irrebuttable presumption is embodied in the general statement of Mr.
'Male v. Williams, 48 N.J.Eq. 33, 36; 21 At. 854; Ansonia National
Bank v. Kunkel, 105 Conn. 744, 753; 136 Ati. 588; Moore's Executor v. Beauchamp, 5 Dana (Ky.) 70, 72; Bacot's Case, MS. (N.J.), cited in note to Apgar's Case, 37 N.J.Eq. 502; Apgar v. Apgar, 38 N.J.Eq. 549, 552; Carney v. Kain, 40 W.Va. 758, 811; 23 S.E. 650. And in Denver & R. G. Ry. v. Harris, 122 U.S. 597, 608, a personal injury case, this court sustained without question the admission of evidence that the injured person had been rendered impotent as a result of the physical injury.
'See note to Apgar's Case, supra, note 1.

U.S. v. PROVIDENT TRUST CO.

272

Opinion of the Court.

Wigmore, quoted by the court below, that evidence of certain kinds of facts is excluded "because its admission would injure some other cause more than it would help the cause of truth, and because the avoidance of that injury is considered of more consequence than the possible harm to the cause of truth." 1 Wigmore on Evidence, 2d ed., § 11. Relating this obviously correct view to the presumption here invoked, not only do we perceive no grounds of expediency or policy that call for its hard and
fast application to a particular physical condition, when ignorance has been supplanted by knowledge so as to put beyond the range of doubt the destructive effect of that condition upon the capacity for childbearing, but we conclude affirmatively that the policy of the statute under review as applied to the case in hand is quite to the contrary.
The important point to be emphasized is that the question arises with respect to a surgical operation, the inevitably destructive effect of which upon the power of procreation is established by tangible and irrefutable proof. Moreover, the case does not involve the rule against perpetuities, the devolution of property, the rights or title of living persons in or to property, or any other situation such as constituted the background of practically all the decisions which have suitained the conclusiveness of the presumption. We have'for consideration simply a statutory provision exempting from a prescribed tax the value of all bequests, etc., made to or for the use of charitable organizations and those which are akin, plainly evincing a legislative policy to encourage such bequests. Edwards v. Slocum, 264 U.S. 61, 63. And, in that view, we well may assume that Congress could not have meant to leave its aim to be diverted by a purely arbitrary presumption, which, whether applicable or not to sustain another or different policy, would deny the

truth and subvert the policy of this particular legislation. Compare Huprcs v. United States, supra, at p. 494.
The sole question to be considered is-What is the value of the interest to be saved from the tax? That is a practical question, not concluded by the presumption invoked but to be determined by ascertaining in terms of money what the property constituting that interest would bring in the market, subject to such uncertainty as ordinarily attaches to such an inquiry. See Ithaca Trust Co. v. United States, supra. Thus stated, the birth of a child to the daughter of the deceased after his death was so plainly impossible that, as a practical matter, the hazard disappears from the problem. Certainly, in the light of our present accurate knowledge in respect of the subject, if the interest had been offered for sale in the open market during the daughter's lifetime, a suggestion of the possibility of such an event would have been ignored by every intelligent bidder as utterly destitute of reason.

The purpose of the Eleventh Amendment was only to prevent the courts of the United States from rendering money judgments against the respective States in favor of private individuals. It was not conceived to deprive the federal courts of jurisdiction over the respective States. Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 406. Charles Warren, The Supreme Court in United States History, vol. 1, pp. 93-102.
When a party intervenes in litigation, he does so in recognition of the jurisdiction of the court and the propriety of all orders and rulings of the court prior to the intervention. French v.

The removal of a case to the Supreme Court of the United States for review of a judgment in favor of a State does not constitute the commencement or prosecution of a suit against the State within the meaning of the Eleventh Amendment. Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 409-410.
The Eleventh Amendment merely confers a privilege, which the State may waive by entering its voluntary appearance and submitting its rights to a federal court. Clark v. Barnard, 108 U.S. 436, 447-448; Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 200 U.S. 273, 284, 291-292; Cunningham v. Macon & Brunswick R. Co., 109 U.S. 446, 451-452.
Where property is in the custody of a court, any question which arises concerning the right of a State to tax such property or to enforce a tax lien against it must be presented to and decided by the court having such
custody. In re Tyler, 149 U.S. 164, 182-3.

The main litigation, to which the present matter is ancillary, was in the .nature of an action in rem, and the property against which the State seeks to enforce its tax lien was and is within the custody of the District Court. Franz v. Buder, 11 F. (2d) 854, 859.
While the state courts and the courts of the United States have concurrent jurisdiction, they are parts of entirely separate systems of jurisprudence, as much as the courts of two foreign sovereign powers, and neither should interfere with the jurisdiction of the other, especially where one has acquired jurisdiction over, or custody of, specific property. Covell v. Heyman, 111 U.S. 176, 182-3; Ponzi v. Fessenden, 258 U.S. 254, 260-261.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.
By an ancillary and supplemental bill of complaint in the District Court of the United States, respondents sought an injunction against the State of Missouri restraining the State from prosecuting certain proceedings in the Probate Court of the City of St. Louis in relation to the estate of Sophie Franz, deceased. The State appeared specially and moved to dismiss the bill upon the ground, among others, that it was a suit against the State, which had not consented to be sued, in violation of the Eleventh Amendnient of the Federal Constitution. The District Judge granted the motion upon that ground. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the order of dismissal, holding that the Eleventh Amendment was inapplicable, in the view that the ancillary and supplemental bill had been brought to prevent an interference with the jurisdiction of the federal court. 62 F. (2d) 150. The case comes here on certiorari, 289 U.S. 720.
The circumstances are these: By the will of Ehrhardt D. Franz, who died in 1898, his property was left to his

wife, Sophie Franz, for life, with remainder to his ten children. The will was probated in the Probate Court of the City of St. Louis. In 1909, Sophie Franz transferred certain securities, in part belonging to her husband's estate, to trustees to hold during her life. On its creation, the trust embraced shares, belonging to her husband's estate, which had been increased by stock dividends; later, these shares were exchanged for shares of a successor corporation and these were further increased by stock dividends
There has been protracted litigation in relation to this
trust and the property held by the trustees. The present suit was brought, in 1924, in the District Court of the United States, by one of the sons of Ehrhardt D. Franz, to determine and quiet his remainder interest and to obtain an accounting and security for his protecti6n. Indispensable parties (owners of other remainder interests) being absent, the original bill was dismissed. Franz v. Buder, 11 F. (2d) 854, 858. An amended bill was filed and the present respondents, who are children of Ehrhardt D. Franz and not residents of Missouri, were brought in with others. On an ancillary bill, it appearing that the federal court had first acquired jurisdiction over the subject matter in an action quasi in rem, defendants Sophie Franz and her trustees were enjoined from prosecuting a
suit in the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis for the determination of the same issues. Franz v. Franz, 15 F. (2d) 797. The present suit in the federal 'court then pro-
ceeded to decree, in 1927, which, with modifications as to security and costs, was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals in the following year. Buder v. Franz, 27 F. (2d) 101.
There is a question between the parties here as to the scope of this decree, but we may assume, for the present purpose; that this decree, as stated by the Circuit Court of Appeals in the decision under review, 62 F. (2d) pp.

Opinion of the Court.

151, 153, 154, determined the rights of the present respondents by virtue of their remainders under the will of Ehrhardt D. Franz. The decree, as thus construed, determined that certain shares, with their increase through stock dividends, were corpus of the estate of Ehrhardt D. Franz, and not income, and hence that Sophie Franz had only a life interest. Id., 27 F. (2d) pp. 105, 113, 114.
Later, in 1930, Sophie Franz died, and her estate is in the course of administration in the Probate Court of the City of St. Louis. Her executor, in view of the decree of the federal court, did not include the shares above mentioned in his inventory of her estate. Thereupon, in 1931,
the State of Missouri procured the issue, on behalf of the State, of a citation in the Probate Court to compel the executor to inventory these shares as assets of the estate of Sophie Franz. The State of Missouri then moved in the federal court for leave to intervene. The State set forth the issue of the citation in the Probate Court; that the respondents, and others in interest, were seeking in the federal court to obtain distribution of the shares of stock in question, and that, to protect the State's right to inheritance taxes, intervention was necessary to oppose
that distribution pending the determination of the issues involved in the proceeding in the Probate Court. The application for intervention was granted.
The State then filed its intervening petition alleging that the decree of the federal court, while finding. the interests in remainder of certain children of Ehrhardt D. Franz, made no finding as to other children, and that the latter, including the present respondents, although remaindermen, had "prior to the entry of said decree, by diverse acts and by pleadings filed in this cause, extinguished, transferred and assigned their remainder interest to the life tenant, Sophie Franz "; that the stock in question "should have been inventoried" and was subject "to the assessment and collection of inheritance taxes

of the State of Missouri under the terms of the will of Sophie Franz," and that for these taxes the State had a lien upon this stock. The petition prayed that a portion of the stock should be transferred to the registry of the federal court to be held until the Probate Court determined whether the stock should have been inventoried by the executor of the estate of Sophie Franz. The present respondents (with others) answered the petition in intervention denying that the decree of the federal court had been limited as alleged and setting up their rights under the decree as res judicata. They asked that the petition be dismissed and that their motions for distribution be sustained.
Shortly before filing this answer the present respondents brought their ancillary and supplemental bill of complaint to enjoin the State of Missouri from "prosecuting further the said citation in the Probate Court" and" from seeking or obtaining any order, decree, or judgment therein " until the further direction of the District Court. The Circuit Court of Appeals, in sustaining the jurisdiction of the District Court to entertain the bill for this purpose, stated that the extent to which that jurisdiction should be exercised was "the protection of the jurisdiction and decrees of the trial court "; that it did not extend to matters not involved in the main litigation. 62 F. (2d) p. 157.
First. The first question is whether the State has waived
the immunity it now claims. Immunity from suit under the Eleventh Amendment is a personal privilege which may be waived. Clark v. Barnard,108 U.S. 436, 447, 448; Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 200 U.S. 273, 284. It may be waived by a voluntary proceeding in intervention (Clark v. Barnard,supra) and the question is as to the effect of the State's application to intervene in this suit. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that it did not

18

Opinion of the Court.

amount to a waiver, but the respondents press the question in supporting the decree under review.
While the motion of the State was for leave to intervene as "a party defendant," the Circuit Court of Appeals pointed out that by the petition in intervention the State did not seek the determination " of any rights or title," that it expressly pleaded "that such determination will take place in theProbate Court," and that the only relief asked was that the federal court should not distribute the stock from the trustees to the present respondents but should "place it in its registry to abide the result of the determi-
nation of the rights of the State by the Probate Court." The Circuit Court of Appeals was of the opinion that the only purpose and result of the intervention would be to retain the stock within Missouri in a place where it could
be made to respond to the tax claims of the State if these claims were upheld. In determining the question presented to it on the appeal, the court was not concerned with the propriety of allowing the intervention for that purpose or with its legal classification as pro interesse auo or otherwise. As only- a "temporary impounding" was sought, which was "in no sense a matter of right, but rather partakes of grace," the court concluded that the intervention was too limited in character to constitute a waiver of the immunity given by. the Amendment, if that immunity would otherwise exist. 62 F. (2d) pp. 152, 153. We think that the Circuit Court of Appeals was right.
Second. The Eleventh Amendment is an explicit limitation of the judicial power of the United States. "The judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by citizens of another State or by citizens or subjects of any foreign State." However important that power, it cannot extend into the forbidden sphere. Considerations of convenience open no

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.

Opinion of the Court.

290 U.S.

avenue of escape from the restriction. The " entire judicial power granted by the Constitution does not embrace authority to entertain a suit brought by private parties against a State without consent given." Ex parte New York, 256 U.S. 490, 497. Such a suit cannot be entertained upon the ground that the controversy arises under the Constitution or laws of the United States. Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1, 10; Palmerv. Ohio, 248 U.S. 32, 34; Duhne v. New Jersey, 251 U.S. 311, 313, 314.
The ancillaty and supplemental bill is brought by the respondents directly against the State of Missouri. It is not a proceeding within the principle that suit may be brought against state officers to restrain an attempt to enforce an unconstitutional enactment. That principle is that the exemption of States from suit does not protect their officers from personal liability to those whose rights they have wrongfully invaded. Tindal v. Wesley, 167 U.S. 204; Prout v. Starr, 188 U.S. 537, 543; Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., supra; Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 150 et seq. Here, respondents are proceeding against the State itself -to prevent the exercise of its authority to maintain a suit in its own court.
The proceeding by ancillary and supplemental bill to restrain the State from this exercise of authority is unquestionably a "suit." Said Chief Justice Marshall in Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 407, 408: "What is a suit? We understand it to be the prosecution, or pursuit, of some claim, demand, or request. In law language, it is the prosecution of some demand in a Court of jus-
tice. . . . To commence a suit is to demand something by the institution of process in a Court of justice; and to prosecute the suit, is, according to the common acceptation of language, to continue that demand. By a suit commenced by an individual against a State, we should understand process sued out by that individual against

MISSOURI v. FISKE.

18

Opinion of the Court.

the State for the purpose of establishing some claim against it by the judgment of a Court; and the prosecution of that suit is its continuance. ' The fact that the motive for the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment was to quiet grave apprehensions that were extensively entertained with respect to the prosecution of state debts in the fed-
eral courts cannot be regarded, as respondents seem to argue, as restricting the scope of the Amendment to suits to obtain money judgments. The terms of the Amendment, notwithstanding the chief motive for its adoption, were not so limited. Expressly applying to suits in equity as well as at law, the Amendment necessarily embraces demands for the enforcement of equitable rights and the prosecution of equitable remedies when these are asserted and prosecuted by an individual against a State. This conception of the Amendment has had abundant illustration. Louisianav. Jumel, 107 U.S. 711, 720; Hagood v. Southern, 117 U.S. 52, 67; In re Ayers, 123 U.S. 443, 497; Fitts v. McGhee, 172 U.S. 516, 529.
Respondents' bill asserts a right to maintain their interests as remaindermen under the will of Ehrhardt D. Franz with respect to certain shares of stock against an attempt of the State to lay inheritance taxes on these shares as the property of Sophie Franz, the deceased life tenant. In order to enforce this asserted right respondents bring their bill to obtain the equitable remedy of injunction against the State. This is not less a suit against the State because the bill is ancillary and. supplemental. The State had not been a party to the litigation which resulted in the decree upon which respondents rely. The State has not come into the suit for the purpose of litigating the rights asserted. Respondents are attempting to subject the State, without its consent, to the court's process.
The question, then, is whether the purpose to protect
the jurisdiction of the federal court, and to maintain its

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.

Opinion of the Court.

290 U.S.

decree against the proceeding of the State in the state court, removes the suit from the application of the Eleventh Amendment. No warrant is found for such a limitation of its terms. The exercise of the judicial power cannot be protected by judicial action which the Constitution specifically provides is beyond the judicial power. Thus, when it appears that a State is an indispensable party to enable a federal court to grant relief sought by private parties, and the State has not consented to be sued, the court will refuse to take jurisdiction. Cunningham v. Macon & Brunswick R. Co., 109 U.S. 446, 451, 457; In re Ayers, supra, p. 489; Christianv. Atlantic & N. C. R. Co., 133 U.S. 233, 244; Stanley v. Schwalby, 147 U.S. 508, 518; South Carolinav. Wesley, 155 U.S. 542, 545; Belknap v. Schild, 161 U.S. 10, 20. And if a State, unless it consents, cannot be brought into a suit by original bill, to enable a federal court to acquire jurisdiction, no basis appears for the contention that a State in the absence of consent may be sued by means of an ancillary and supplemental bill in order to enforce a decree.
The fact that a suit in a federal court is in rem, or quasi in rem, furnishes no ground for the issue of process against a non-consenting State. If the State chooses to come into the court as plaintiff, or to intervene, seeking the enforcement of liens or claims, the State may be permitted to do so, and in that event its rights will receive the same consideration as those of other parties in interest. But when the State does not come in and withholds its consent, the court has no authority to issue process against the State to compel it to subject itself to the court's judgment, whatever the nature of the suit. See The Siren, 7 Wall. 152, 154; The Davis, 10 Wall. 15, 19; Georgia v. Jesup, 106 U.S. 458, 462; Cunningham v. Macon & Brunswick R. Co., supra, p. 452. Ex parte New York, supra, pp. 497500.

MISSOURI v. FISKE.

18

Opinion of the Court.

We express no opinion upon the question whether the decree of the District Court, entered during the lifetime of Sophie Franz, the life tenant, in this suit to which she, her trustees and the remaindermen were parties, can be regarded as binding upon the State of Missouri with respect to its subsequent claim for inheritance taxes against the shares in controversy as a part of the life tenant's estate. That question is not before us. Whatever may be found to be the effect of this decree in that relation, the result
is the same so far as the present question of the right of respondents to bring this bill against the State is concerned. If the State, by reason of the fact that it was not a party to the litigation, is not bound by the decree, it is manifestly free to litigate its claim to the taxes in the proceeding it has instituted in its own court. United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 222; Tindal v. Wesley, supra, p. 223; McClellan v. Carland,217 U.S. 268, 282. But if the decree of the federal court can be considered as determining the ownership of the shares so as to bind the State in later tax proceedings upon the death of the life tenant and there is a federal right to have that effect given to the decree, that federal right can be specially set up and claimed in the proceeding in the state court, and, if the right is finally denied" the decision may be the subject of review by this Court in case the appropriate procedure is followed. Waterman v. Canal-LouisianaBank Co., 215 U.S. 33, 46. See Tilt v. Kelsey, 207 U.S. 43. The contention that the question of ownership of the shares has been finally determined by the federal cort affords no ground for the conclusion that the federal court may entertain a suit against the State, without its consent, to prevent the State from seeking to litigate that question in the state court.
The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded to the District Court with directioils to dismiss the ancillary and supplemental bill.
Reversed.

Argument for Respondents.

Mr. Robert H. McNeill for petitioner.

Mr. Wm.E. Leahy, with whom Messrs. Wm.J. Hughes, Jr., Eugene B. Sullivan, and James F. Reilly were on the brief, for respondents.
As the answer denied that plaintiff became a bona fide resident of Florida, and that the marriage in Florida was in good faith, the only question submitted to tue Court is whether a residence in Florida acquired in bad faith, and a marriage in bad faith, must be recognized by the District of Columbia courts.
Not only therefore. does the record show that defendants
denied that plaintiff acquired a bo"ia fide domicile in Florida, but other facts in the record show that it is unlikely that she could have acquired a bona fide residence in Florida within the short time which elapsed between the date she was adjudged guilty of adultery with Lougliran and the date she married him.
The good faith of the Florida residence and marriage being denied, the present case is exactly like Olverson v. Olverson, 54 App.D.C. 48, followed by the court below.
The full faith and credit clause does not require the District of Columbia courts, to recognize a marriage in violation of the public policy of the District of Columbia itself. It does not apply in the District of Columbia; in so far as it is effective, it operates in the District only by reason of a federal statute. Act of March 27, 1804; 28 U.S.C., § 687.
The full faith and credit clause does not require the courts of a given jurisdiction to recognize a public act or record of another jurisdiction which is contrary to the public policy of the State of the forum. Simmons v. Simmons, 57 App.D.C. 216.
It is difficult to conceive how § 966 of the D.C. Code can be construed other than as a declaration of 'public policy. The legislative history of that section shows that it is so.

218

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.

Argument for Respondents.

292 U. S.

The divorce law of the District both as to length of
time for residence and also in limiting the causes of divorce to adultery, is one of the most stringent in the
country. The Court of Appeals has not declared the public policy
of this jurisdiction; it has merely taken cognizance of and applied an Act of Congress which does so.
It seems to be conceded by petitioner's counsel that if the marriage in the present case were a polygamous, incestuous or an abhorrent marriage, the full faith and credit clause would not require it to be recognized in the District even though it had been entered into in Florida.. Am.L.Inst., Restatement of the Law of Marriage and
Divorce, §§ 137, 138, 139, 142. The foregoing sections
of the Restatement are of interest in the present case for the reason that Congress in enacting the District of Columbia Code has put the marriage of persons whose previous marriage has not been terminated by divorce in exactly the same classification as incestuous and polygamous marriages. D.C. Code, c. 43, § 1283. If the marriage has not been terminated by death or a decree of divorce, it is in exactly the same classification as an incestuous marriage.
The marriage of plaintiff to Daye was not terminated by a decree of divorce within the meaning of the word "terminate" as used in § 1283.
A further indication that the marriage has not been terminated in any absolute or complete sense is the fact that § 966 prohibiting the remarriage of a guilty party does not in so many words prescribe a penalty: It must be.presumed that Congress enacted this with some intelligent purpose in mind and intended to make it as effective as it reasonably could. If it be conceded that it prescribes no penalty, and if it does not impinge-upon the completeness of the decree of divorce, it follows that it is ineffec-

LOUGHRAN v. LOUGHRAN.

Argument for Respondents.

tive for any purpose whatsoever. *The only rational interpretation of this section is that it is a statutory provision which is read into the decree of divorce in an applicable, case, and that it deprives that decree of the absoluteness and completeness which it would otherwise have.
It should be noted also that the proviso of § 966 to the effect that only the innocent party may. remarry is contained in the very section which conveys power upon the court to graht a diirorce. Certainly it can not be contended that a court of the District could, in the teeth of § 966, pass a decree of divorce authorizing the guilty party to remarry. This being so, the reservation of the right of the guilty party to remarry is a limitation upon the power of the court to terminate a marriage by divorce.
The importance of whether plaintiff's marriage has been terminated within the meaning of § 1283 becomes clear when it is considered that § 1287 of the District of Columbia Code makes illegal in the District any marriage of persons domiciled in the District, if celebrated outside of the District, which marriage is illegal inside the District.
A court of equity has the right to deny equitable relief to one who has deliberately created a situation contrary to the public policy of the lex fori.
Petitioner herein, in equity, seeks the remedy of the District of Columbia court, whose decree in personam she has flouted and ignored. Her claim for dower is founded
upon a marriage prohibited by a statute of the jurisdiction in which she seeks relief. Armstrong v. Toler, 11 Wheat. 258; Hall v. Coppelt, 7 Wall. 542; Oscanyan v. ArmB Co., 103 U.S. 261; Higginsv. McCrea, 116 U.S. 671; Hunter v. Wheate, 53 App.D.C. 206; Olverson v. Olverson, 54 App.D.C. 48; Morck v. Abel, 3 B. & P. 35; Collins v. Blanterm, 1 Smith's Lead. Cas., Pt. 2, p. 716; Vandyck

No principle seems to be better settled than that no court will lend its aid to one who founds his cause of action upon an illegal act. The good faith of the alleged Florida residence and the marriage therein being denied, the petitioner appeared in the court below as one whose position was created by reason of her violation of § 966, a positive law of the District of Columbia.. Upon that ground, the court refused to lend to her its aid. The status she created was prohibited by law, on this present record.
Many cases are cited by petitioner to the effect that a marriage valid where performed is valid everywhere. To this rule there are exceptions as well known as the rule itself. Of these the most important is a marriage which the legislature, either by express terms or necessary implication, has declared to be invalid because of the public policy of the enacting State. Maynard v. Hill, 125 U.S. 190.
If the statute prohibiting the remarriage of the guilty party in divorce actions, contrary to the statute of the forum, is interpreted as an expression of the public policy of the enacting State, then a subsequent remarriage in. another jurisdiction is invalid in the enacting State, notwithstanding the lex loci of the second jurisdiction.

216

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case is here on certiorari to the Court 5f Appeals of the District of Columbia. It is a suit in equity brought in the Supreme Court of the District in 1932, by Ruth Loughran, then resident there. The defendants are John Loughran and others, trustees of real estate there located. The estate of Daniel Loughran, Jr., deceased, is a bene-
ficiary. The plaintiff alleges that she is Daniel's widow; and she seeks to enforce, as such, rights in the nature of dower and to recover unpaid alimony. She alleges that in 1926 she married Daniel in Florida after living there more than two years; that in 1927 she and her said husband established their domicile in Virginia; that in 1929, while they were residing in Virginia, she obtained there a decree of divorce from him a mensa et thoro, with an award of alimony payable monthly; and that in 1931, while she remained Daniel's wife, he .died, leaving a part of the alimony unpaid.
The trustees defend on the ground that before her mar-
riage to Daniel, the plaintiff had been married to Henry Daye; that in 1924, while she and Daye were domiciled in the District, he had secured there an absolute divorce for her adultery with Daniel; that being the guilty party, she was by § 966 of the Code of the District prohibited from remarrying; and that, having remarried in violation of the statute, she is not in a position to enforce in a court of the District the alleged rights in the estate of the deceased. A copy of the record of the Daye divorce proceeding -is annexed to the answer.
Section 966 provides: "A divorce from the bond of marriage may be granted only where one of the parties has committed adultery during the marriage: Provided, That in such case the

222

292 U.S.

innocent party only may remarry, but nothing herein contained shall prevent the remarriage of the divorced parties to each other: . . ."
On motion of the plaintiff, the case' was heard on bill and answer. The trial court entered a decree for the plaintiff in respect to the claim in the nature of dower. That decree was reversed by the Court of Appeals of the District. It ordered that the cause be remanded to the lower court for further proceedings not inconsistent with
the opinion, 62 App.D.C. 262, 263; 66 F. (2d) 567, 569, saying:
"It is unnecessary for us to concern ourselves with the legality of the Florida marriage in that State, or with the subsequent divorce proceedings in the State of Virginia since the disposition of the case is dependent entirely
upon the law of the District of Columbia. In so far as the law of the District is concerned, the marriage between plaintiff and Daniel Loughran, Jr., in Florida, if performed in the District of Columbia, would be absolutely void, and the plaintiff, being the offending party against the law of the District, is in no position to enforce any
claim against the estate of Daniel Loughran, Jr., growing out of the marriage in Florida."
Disclaiming consideration of the doctrine of clean hands, the court added:
"Plaintiff, by her own unlawful conduct has placed herself without the pale of the law, and cannot be heard in a court of equity to take advantage of her own wrong."
The trustees insist that the bill was properly dismissed
because the plaintiff, retaining her domicile in the District, went to Florida and married there in order to evade the prohibition of § 966. The plaintiff contends that the admitted facts constitute no defence; that because the marriage was legal in Florida, its legality should, under the
established doctrines governing conflict of laws, have been recognized by the courts of the District; and, more-

Opinion of the Court.

over, that this was required by the full faith and credit clause, since the validity of the Florida marriage had been adjudicated by the Virginia decree of divorce a mensa et
thoro. First. Marriages not polygamous or incestuous, or
otherwise declared void by statute,1 will, if valid by the law of the State where entered into, be recognized as valid in every other jurisdiction. Meister v. Moore, 96 U.S. 76; Travers v. Reinhardt, 205 U.S. 423, 440. The mere statutory prohibitioft by the State of the domicile either generally of the remarriage of a divorced person, or of remarriage within a prescribed period after the entry of the decree, is given only territorial effect. Such a statute does not invalidate a marriage solemnized in another State in conformity with the laws thereof.2
Second. We have no occasion to decide what the rights of the parties would be if it appeared that the plaintiff and her paramour, retaining at all times their domicile in the District, had gone to Florida for the purpose of evading § 966 by a marriage there; and had then returned to the District to live as man and wife." It is argued that marriage within the District would have been illegal be-

has no application to marriages in violation of the prohibition of § 966. Section 1287 provides:
"If any marriage declared illegal by the aforegoing sections shall be entered into in another jurisdiction by persons having and retaining their domicile in the District of Columbia, such marriage shall be deemed illegal, and may be decreed to be void in said District in the same manner as if it had been celebrated therein."
The sections preceding § 1287 relate solely to marriages void, because incestuous or polygamous, and to those which are voidable, because entered into by a person who was a lunatic, under the age of consent, or impotent, and those which are voidable because procured by force or fraud. In the case at bar, there is no suggestion of any
such obstacle to the validity of the marriage. The only objection urged is that by marrying in Florida the plaintiff violated § 966. But the preceding sections do not refer to § 966; and they contain no reference to remarriage of divorced persons. Their only reference to divorce is in Paragraph Third of § 1283 which declares void:
"The marriage of any persons either of whom has been previously married and whose previous marriage has not been terminated by death or a decree of divorce."
Since the plaintiff had been legally divorced from Daye in the District while the parties were domiciled there, and the decree became effective under § 983a, unconditionally and irrevocably, she was thereafter an unmarried woman; and if she had cohabited with Daniel in the District after the Florida marriage she would not have been guilty of polygamy. Commonwealth v. Lane, 113 Mass. 458, 460, 462.
Moreover, it does not appear that the plaintiff and Daniel did retain their domiciles in the District after her divorce, or that after the Florida marriage they ever lived in the District as man and wife. The trustees argue that it must be assumed on the pleadings that plaintiff's resi-

dence in Florida and the marriage there were not in good faith.4 But the bill alleged the good faith of the residence and marriage in Florida; and the answer contains no specific, denial of that allegation. Nor does it contain any averment that the residence in Florida and marriage there were with the intent of evading the prohibition against remarriage.' The Court of Appeals did not pass upon the issue sought to be raised. It expressly disclaimed deciding whether the Florida marriage was valid or what the effect of the Virginia decree was. And the question
whether the marriage in Florida should be deemed void within the District because the parties went to Florida to evade the prohibition of § 966 was not presented by the petition for a writ of certiorari.
Third. The Court of Appeals stated that "the single
question for determination here is, whether or not plaintiff is entitled to her dower interest "; and it held that the bill should be dismissed, regardless of whether the marriage was valid under the law of Florida. The requisites of dower are a valid marriage; seizin of the husband; and his death. It may be assumed that the law of the situs
of real estate determines whether a widow is entitled to dower. Compare De Vaughan v. Hutchinson, 165 U.S. 566, 570. But, if the marriage was valid under the laws of Florida, the plaintiff was, under established doctrines of the conflict of laws, Daniel's widow. As such she was entitled, as an incident of the marriage, to dower in the property -within the District. For, while a statute of the

District provides for forfeiture of dower in case of the
wife's adultery during marriage;' none denies dower to a widow beca"-p she had been guilty of adultery prior to
the marriage with her late husband. Section 966 is not extra-territorial in its operation. It
does not purport to prohibit remarriage outside the District; and no other statute denies dower to a, widow be-
cause by remarrying elsewhere she had disregarded the prohibition contained in § 966. It does not make remarriage a crime, or in terms impose any penalty, even if contracted within the District; and obviously it could not make criminal remarriage elsewhere. Nor does it in terms declare the remarriage void. Apparently, it is the law of the District that a remarriage elsewhere in
disregard of the prohibition of § 966, even where both parties remained domiciled in the District, is not void ab initio, but, at most, voidable; and that a voidable marriage cannot be annulled after the death of either
spouse.' No case has been found in which, independently of
statutory direction, a widow has been denied dower on the ground that a remarriage, legal by the law of the place where celebrated, had been entered into in violation of some prohibition imposed by the law of the State in
'The Code of the District 1929, Title 14, § 30, declares: "If a wife willingly leave her husband, and go away, and continue with her advouterer, she shall be barred forever of action to demand her dower, that she ought to have of her husband's lands, if she be convict thereupon, except that her husband willingly, and without coercion reconcile her, and suffer her to dwell with him in which case she shall be restored to her action."

which the divorce was granted and the property was situated.8 Ordinarily the operation of a statute of descent and distribution is held not affected even by the fact that the death of the decedent was caused by a crime
of the heir; 0 and, by the common law, dower is not barred even by misconduct during marriage. Since, as matter of substantive law, the plaintiff is entitled to dower in property within the District, if the marriage in Florida was valid, and its validity was assumed by the Court of Appeals, we have no occasion to consider whether the decree in the Virginia divorce proceedings made that matter res judicata.
Fourth. The relief sought by the bill includes, besides dower rights, a claim under the Virginia decree for the alimony which had accrued and remained unpaid at the time of Daniel's death. The right to recover the alimony is independent of the right to dower. It rests upon a judgment to which, so far as appears, full faith and credit must be given by the courts of the District. It is true that, under rules of law generally applicable, these courts may reuse to enforce a mere right of contract if it provides for doing within the District things prohibited by its laws. Bothwell v. Buckbee, Mears Co., 275 U.S. 274, 278. It may, in the exercise of the police power, prohibit the enjoyment by persons within its borders of many rights acquired elsewhere and refuse to lend the aid of its courts to enforce them. Home Insurance Co. v. Dick, 281 U.S. 397, 410. But when rights, however arising, have ripened into a judgment of a court in another State, the full faith

And courts of the District are bound, equally with courts of the States, to observe the command of the full faith and credit clause, wherever applicable. BradfordElectricLight Co.v. Clapper, 286 U.S. 145, 155. Thus, the facts stated afford no basis in the substantive law for dismissal of the bill so far as it seeks to recover unpaid alimony. Whether the fact that this claim has been presented also in the probate court constitutes a reason for denying relief here, was not discussed below, and on this matter we express no opinion.
Fifth. It remains to consider whether the denial of relief can be justified on some principle of adjective law. The Court of Appeals holds that the "plaintiff by her own unlawful conduct has placed herself without the pale of the law "; but it does not state specifically the ground for that conclusion. The bar applied is not the plea of illegality commonly interposed in suits brought to enforce contracts tainted by illegality. In those suits the illegality relied on is inherent in the cause of action; is directly connected with the relief sought; and constitutes a substantive defence. Here, the relation of the illegality to the relief sought is indirect and remote. The wrong done is a thing' f 'the past and is collateral. By the long line of cases following Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co., 184 U.S. 540, it is settled that illegality constitutes no defense when merely collateral to the cause of action sued on. A "person does not become an outlaw and lose all rights by doing an illegal act." ,NationalBank & Loan Co. v. Petrie, 189 U.S. 423, 425. Courts grant relief against present wrongs and to enforce an existing right, although the property involved was acqu'ired by some past illegal act. Brooks v. Martin, 2 Wall. 70, 79, 80; Planters'Bank v. Union Bank, 16 Wall. 483, 499, 500.

LOUGHRAN v. LOUGHRAN.

216

Opinion of the Court.

The Court of Appeals, while it disclaimed acting on the doctrine of clean hands,"0 declared that Olverson v. 01verson, 54 App.D.C. 48; 293 Fed. 1015 (decided by it in 1923) is decisive of the case at bar. But both the facts and the relief sought are different in the two cases. In the first place, the parties in the Olverson case were at the time of the marriage domiciled in the District; remained
so when they went to Baltimore for the marriage ceremony with the purpose of evading the prohibition of § 966; returned immediately thereafter to the District; and then lived in the District as man and wife. On the other hand, in the case at bar it does not appear that the plaintiff and Daniel were domiciled in the District at the time of the marriage; or that they went to Florida in order to evade the prohibition of § 966; or that during their marriage they lived in the District; or that they ever
cohabited there as man and wife. In the second place, the Olverson suit was brought by a wife for a decree of divorce a mensa et thoro with a motion for alimony; and was dismissed on the ground that the plaintiff could not "ask the courts of this jurisdiction to relieve her of the obligations of a relation which she willfully and wrongfully assumed."
The suit at bar was brought after termination of the marriage by death to enforce existing property rights growing out of the marriage in Florida and the decree entered in Virginia. It was not brought to enforce any transaction had within the District; nor was it brought to enforce an illegal contract; or to further an illegal relation.1 Equity does not demand that its suitors shall have led blameless lives. Neither the doctrine of clean
