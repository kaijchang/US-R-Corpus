arguendo conceded that such power had been theretofore
possessed by the officials who exercised authority within the area which was made a territory by the constitution." But this only in passing. We are not called upon to consider the power of the territorial officers. The validity of the grants have been pronounced by Congress and we are only required to consider their relation to each other and the public domain. We have seen that the Beck grant in all of its steps, was prior to the Perea grant. Juridical possession was given of it before the Perea grant was applied for and the conveyance of the land embraced within its boundaries made complete. It was confirmed first by the Surveyor General of the Territory and surveyed first by the Interior Department, and a survey "was essential to its accurate segregation and delimitation." Stoneroad v. Stoneroad, supra, 158 U. S.240, 250.
It follows from these views that the land in conflict is part of the Beck grant, and the judgment of the Supreme Court of the Territory is reversed and the cause remanded to the Supreme Court of the State for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

TAYLOR, ADMINISTRATRIX, v. TAYLOR.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
No. 224. Argued January 30, 1914.-Decided February 24, 1914.
The Employers' Liability Act of 1908, as amended in 1910, supersedes all state statutes upon the subject covered by it, and the distribution of the amount recovered in an action for death of an employ6 is determined by the provisions of that act and not by the state law.

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

232 U. S.

The source of right of the widow of an employ6 of an interstate carrier to maintain an action for his death is the Federal statute, whether the cause of action is based on § 1 or § 9, and the father of the deceased is nof entitled to share in the amount recovered.

THE facts, which involve the construction of the Federal Employers' Liability Act of 1908 as amended in 1910, are stated in the opinion.

Mr. Frederic D. Mckenney, with whom Mr. George F. Brownell, Mr. John Spalding Flannery and Mr. William Hitz were on the brief, for plaintiff in error:
It was error for the state court to hold that the'net proceeds of the judgment recovered in the action of the administratrix against the railroad company, under the circumstances shown in the record herein, were not distributable under the provisions of the federal Employers' Liability Act of 1908 as amended in 1910.
The net proceeds of this judgment are not "assets of the decedent's estate" within the ordinary acceptation of that phrase.
In support of these contentions see: American R. R. Co. v. Didrickson, 227 U. S. 145, 149; Florida Cent. Ry. Co. v. Sullivan, 120 Fed. Rep. 799; Gulf &c. R. Co. v. McGinnis, 228 U.

TAYLOR v. TAYLOR.

232 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

No brief was filed for defendant in error.
MR. JUSTICE MCKENNA delivered the opinion of the court.
The plaintiff in error and defendant in error are respectively the widow and father of one Howard Taylor, a resident of Orange County, State of New York, who through the negligence of the Erie Railroad Company met with an accident which caused his death.
Plaintiff. in error was appointed the administratrix of his estate with right to prosecute any right of action granted by special provision of law as such administratrix. She brought suit, as such administratrix, against the Railroad Company for damages, alleging the employment of her husband in interstate commerce upon a train running from Port Jervis, New York, to Jersey City, New Jersey, the negligence of the Railroad Company as the cause of his death, and that the action was brought under the act of Congress of April 22, 1908, c. 149, 35 Stat. 65, entitled "An Act relating to the Liability of Common Carriers by Railroad to their Employs in Certain Cases," known as the Employers' Liability Law.
By permission o ,,le Surrogate of Orange County, she compromised with the railroad, accepting a judgment for $5,000.
Defendant in error filed a petition in the Supreme Court of Orange County for an order directing plaintiff in error to pay over to him one-half of the net proceeds of the judgment in accordance with the statute of distribution of the State. The motion was denied and an order was entered determining that plaintiff in error, as widow of the deceased, was entitled to receive and retain for her own use all of the net proceeds of the judgment. The order was reversed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court and the judgment of reversal, on appeal to the Court of Appeals, was affirmed and the record re-

mitted to the Supreme Court. This writ of error was then
prosecuted. The Appellate Division was of opinion that the law of
the State gave the right of action and determined the distribution of the proceeds of the judgment. Considering the act of Congress and its provisions, the court was of the
view that the act of Congress "should be construed as one granting a new remedy under certain circumstances, where none, or a less adequate one, existed under the state laws, and as not intended to supplant or abrogate a right of
action of practically equal extent existing under the laws of the State." The court further said, "It is only on the theory that this act of Congress constitutes the exclusive rule applicable to the facts of the case before us that the order of the Special Term [the order under review] can be upheld. If the remedy afforded by our laws be concurrent with that provided by Congress, then we think that our
public policy will not permit an administratrix appointed by our courts under our laws, to use the Federal statute simply for the purpose of defeating our statute of distribution of personal property." The Court of Appeals expressed the opinion that the case presented a case of conflict between the Federal and state statutes and determined that the state statutes must prevail. It was said that the power of Congress "to regulate interstate commerce must end somewhere, and as far as employs of common carriers engaged in interstate commerce are concerned, it appears to us that it must end with the death of the employd." And considering that the consequences of a contrary doctrine would give Congress power over the distribution of real estate which might happen to be purchased by the earnings of an employ6 in interstate commerce, the court declared that the act of Congress in so far as it attempted to distribute the funds in controversy was "invalid and unauthorized." There were dissenting opinions expressed. The judgment of the

TAYLOR v. TAYLOR.

232 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Appellate Division of the Supreme Court was affirmed and the record was remitted to the Supreme Court to be proceeded upon according to law and the judgment of the latter court was entered conformably thereto.
We have had many occasions to declare the comprehensive and exclusive power which Congress possesses over interstate commerce. And starting with that power as a factor, we have only to consider the breadth and meaning of the act of Congress.
Section 1 provides that every common carrier by railroad, while engaged in interstate commerce, "shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier in such commerce, or, in case of the death of such employ6, to his or her personal representative, for the benefit of the surviving widow or husband and children of such employS; and, if none, then of such employ6's parents; and, if none, then of the next of kin, dependent upon such employ6, for such injury or death resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employ~s of such carrier," or by reason of any defect in its instrumentalities.
Section 6, as amended by the act of April 5, 1910, c. 143, 36 Stat. 291, provides that the jurisdiction of the *courts of the United States shall be concurrent with that of the courts of the several States, and if the action be brought in a state court it shall not be removed to a court of the United States.
Section 9, as amended by the same act, c. 143, 36 Stat. 291, is as follows:
"That any right of action given by this Act to a person suffering injury shall survive to his or her personal representative, for the benefit of the surviving widow or husband and children of such employ6, and, if none, then of such employ6's parents; and, if none, then of the next of kin dependent upon such employ6, but in such cases there shall be only one recovery for the same injury."

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.

Opinion of the Court.

232 U. S.

The act has come up for consideration in a number of cases. In Mondou v. New York, New Haven & Hartford R. R. Co., 223 U. S. 1, it and its amendments were declared to be constitutional, that having been enacted in pursuance of a power reserved to Congress, state laws must give away to them. They established the policy for all, it was decided, and the courts of a State cannot refuse to enforce
them on the ground that they are not in harmony with the policy of the State. Congress having acted, it was said, p. 55, "the laws of the States, in so far as they cover the same field, are superseded, for necessarily that which is not
supreme must yield to that which is." In Missouri, Kansas & Texas Ry. v. Wulf, 226 U. S.
570, 576, the Mondou Case was applied. The action was brought by the mother of a deceased employ6 in interstate commerce, under the state statute. The petition was subsequently amended to embrace a right of action by her
under the Federal law as the personal representative of the decedent. The amendment was held not to be the commencement of a new action. It was said that notwithstanding the original petition asserted a cause of action under the state statute without making reference to the act of Congress, the court was presumed to be cognizant of the Federal enactment, and "to know that, with respect to the responsibility of interstate carriers by railroad to their employ6s injured in such commerce after its.enactment it had the effect of superseding state laws upon the
subject." In Michigan CentralR. R. Co. v. Vreeland, 227 U. S.59,
68, it is again said that the act of Congress has undertaken to cover the subject of the liability of railroad companies to their employ~s injured while engaged in interstate commerce and that state legislation was superseded by it. "The obvious purpose of Congress," it was said, "was to save a right of action to certain relatives dependent
upon an employ6 wrongfully injured, for the loss and

TAYLOR v. TAYLOR.

232 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

damage resulting to them financially by reason of the wrongful death." And again, "It is one beyond that which the decedent had,-one proceeding upon altogether
different principles." The same view was expressed in American RailroadCo.
v. Didrickson, 227 U. S. 145, 149. The action was by surviving parents, they being the sole beneficiaries under the statute. A distinction was expressed between a cause of action to an injured employ6 and in case of his death, a cause of action to dependent relatives; and of the first it was said that it does not survive his death but that in such case the act "creates a new and distinct right of action for the benefit of the dependent relatives named in the statute" for the damages which results to them because they have been deprived of a reasonable expectation of pecuniary benefits on account of his wrongful death.
In Gulf, Colorado& Santa Fe Railway Co. v. McGinnis, Administratrix, 228 U. S. 173, the statute was again considered as giving a cause of action to the personal representative of the deceased employ6 for the benefit of the persons designated because of the pecuniary loss resulting to them.
In St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern Ry. Co. v. Hesterly, 228 U. S. 702, the same principles were applied. In St. Louis, S. F. & Texas Ry. Co. v. Seale, 229 U. S. 156, the action was by the widow and parent of an interstate commerce employS. The petition stated a case under the state statute. The Railroad Company contended that the Federal statute was the applicable one. There was a conflict between the statutes. The state statute
gave the right of action to the surviving husband, wife, children and parents; the Federal statute vested the right of action in the personal representative of the deceased for certain named beneficiaries, the parents of the deceased having no rights if there be a widow, husband or children. The Railroad Company, therefore, interposed the objec-

232 U. S.

tion grounded on the Federal statute that the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover on the case proved. The state court overruled the objection and we declared the ruling to be error. We said, p. 162, "Two of the plaintiffs, the father and mother, in whose favor there was a separate recovery, are not even beneficiaries under the Federal statute, there being a surviving widow; and she was not entitled to recover in her own name, but only through the deceased's personal representative, as is shown by the terms of the statute and the decisions before cited."
These cases were all brought under the statute as originally enacted and before the amendments of 1910. Section 1, however, was not amended, and in St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern Ry. Co. v. Hesterly, supra, it was said that the amendment of April 5, 1910, which added § 9, quoted above, "in like manner allows but one recovery, although it provides for survival of the right of the injured person."
It is clear from these decisions that the source of the right of plaintiff in error was the Federal statute; and this whether the cause of action is based on the first section of the act or on § 9, added in 1910. From plaintiff in error's complaint against the Railroad Company it is not clear whether she counted on § 1 alone or on that and § 9. If under § 1, the cause of action was not derived from the deceased in the sense of a sucdession from him. As said in one of the cited cases, her cause of action was "one beyond that which the decedent had,-one proceeding upon altogether different principles." It came to her, it is true, on account of his death but because of her pecuniary interest in his life and the damage she suffered by his death. It was her loss, not that which his father may have suffered. The judgment she recovered was for herself alone. He had no interest in it.. Any loss he may have suffered was not and could not have been any part of it, as we have seen.

CALAF v. CALAF.

232 U. S.

Counsel for Appellants.

If the action included a right under § 9, the recovery was for her benefit exclusively as the widow of the decedent. The language of the section is that the right of action given to the employ6 survives to his personal representatives for the benefit of his parents only when fhere is no widow.
Judgment reversed and cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistentwith this opinion.

No. 199. Argued January 26, 1914.-Decided February 24, 1914.
While under the laws of Toro parol acts, although not amounting to a solemn recognition, may have entitled a natural child to sue in Porto Rico for a share of the parent's inheritance and prove the acts in the same suit, the existing Code requires a preliminary proceeding to prove those,acts and to declare their effect, and limits the time within which such proceeding can be brought. Cordova v. Folgueras, 227 U. S. 375.
A judgment or decree bars all grounds for the relief sought and, as res judicata, it is a bar to a subsequent suit between the same parties the object of which is to reach the same result by different means.
Whether the judgment in a former suit between the same parties was or was not final is a question of local practice upon which this court follows the local court unless strong reasons are produced against it.

possession of the asserted property rights be assumed, it must follow that the power to remove, given by the statute, must be sustained. Considering the context of the act, the limitation which it imposes upon the members of the tribe and the tribe itself to contract and the large administrative supervision over such subjects which the statute confers upon the Secretary, it is not disputable that the right to remove for "good cause to be by him determined" which the statute gives to the Secretary is but an appropriate means provided for the accomplishment of the duties cast upon him with reference to the subject-matters stated. Under these circumstances the proposition could not be maintained without holding that although the duty existed to protect by appropriate legislation the tribe and its members, suich legislation if enacted, would be repugnant to the Constitution.

Memorandum opinion by direction of the court. By
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WHITE.

As administratrix of the estate of her deceased husband, the plaintiff in error sued to recover for the loss occasioned by his death alleged to have resulted from the negligence of the defendant railroad company. Over the objection of the defendant the case was submitted by the trial court to the jury and from the judgment entered on the verdict rendered against the railroad company, error was by the company prosecuted from the Circuit Court of Appeals. On the hearing that court concluding that the evidence did not justify the submission of the case to the jury, reversed the judgment and in passing upon a motion made by the railroad company in the trial court, pursuant to the Pennsylvania practice for judgment in its favor non obstante veredicto it was held that the motion was well taken and the case was remanded to the trial court not for a new trial, but with directions to enter a judgment for the defendant. (200 Fed. Rep. 359.) As the case as made by the pleadings depended not merely upon diverse citizenship, but was expressly based on the Employers' Liability Act, error was prosecuted from this court.
We shall not undertake to analyze the evidence or review the grounds which led the court below to conclude that error was committed in submitting the case to the jury, because we think it is adequate to say that after a careful examination of the record we see no reason for holding that the court below erred in so deciding. As regards however, the ruling on the motion for judgment

affirm and modify; that is, to affirm the judgment of reversal and to modify by reversing so much of the action of the court below as directed the entry of a judgment in favor of the defendant. Conformably to this conclusion it is ordered that the judgment of reversal be, and the same is hereby affirmed, and that the direction for entry of judgment in favor of defendant be reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court with directions to set aside its judgment and grant a new trial.

PRIEST v. TRUSTEES OF THE TOWN OF LAS VEGAS, NEW MEXICO.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF THE TERRITORY OF NEW MEXICO.
No. 218. Submitted January 28, 1914.-Decided March 9, 1914.
A judgment in a suit to quiet title to real property in New Mexico is not binding on a person or corporation or trustees having an interest in the premises who could be definitely located and served with process and who were not joined by name. The court did not acquire jurisdiction over them.
The statutes of New Mexico which, in 1894, permitted unknown claimants to be joined as defendants as such and to be served by publication, did not relate to parties who could be definitely located and joined or who were confirmees of the grant including the property under the act of June 21, 1860.
In affirming a judgment, an appellate court is not confined to the grounds on which the court below based the judgment.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WHITE.

The ground upon which it is asserted in this case that the statute of the State of South Dakota, upon which the judgment of the court below here under review was based, is repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, was considered and held to be well taken in a case decided this term. (Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. Polt, ante, p. 165.) As that decision is conclusive upon all the issues here presented and establishes that the statute in question is inconsistent with the Constitution and void, it results that for the reasons stated in the case referred to, the judgment in this case must be reversed and the case remanded to the court below for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

PEOPLE OF PORTO RICO v, RAMOS.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR PORTO RICO.
No. 390. Submitted February 25, 1914.-Decided March 16, 1914.
Immunity of sovereignty from suit without consent does not permit the sovereign to reverse the action invoked by it so that it may come in and go out of court at will without the right of the other party to resist either step.
While Porto Rico may not in ordinary actions be sued without its consent, a voluntary appearance after due consideration and request to be made a party by the Attorney General on the ground of interest in the controversy, amounts to a consent, and thereafter Porto Rico cannot object to the jurisdiction on account of its immunity as a sovereign.

Opinion of the Court.

232 U. S.

Where the District Court of the United States for Porto Rico had jurisdiction of an action involving title to real estate brought by a citizen of Porto Rico against a foreign subject, the jurisdiction is not ousted because Porto Rico becomes, on the application of the Attorney General, the sole party defendant.

Mr. Felix Frankfurterfor plaintiff in error.

Mr. Frank Antonsanti and Mr. Frederick 5. Tyler for defendant in error.

MR.JUSTICE McKENNA delivered the opinion of the court.

Action in ejectraent for certain described lands in Porto Rico brought by defendant in error, a citizen of Porto Rico, against Eduardo Wood, a subject of Great Britain.
Defendant, in error alleged in his complaint that he was the owner, possessed and entitled to the possession of the lands and that Wood, claiming that the property belonged to the estate of Eliza Kortright, of which he was the duly appointed administratoT, without right or title entered upon the lands and ejetted defendant in error therefrom. Restitution of the lands was prayed and damages in the sum of $5000.
The complaint was filed November 12, 1909, and process duly issued thereon. On November 19, 1909, the defendant, Wood, filed a paper entitled "Motion to make the People of Porto Rico a party defendant and for an

extension of time to plead." It was alleged in the motion that the People of Porto Rico had been declared and adjudged to be the sole heir of Eliza Kortright by an order made by the District Court in and for the Judicial District of San Juan, she having died intestate and without leaving any legal heirs.
That the People of Porto Rico, by virtue of such declaration of heirship, have an interest in the result of the suit and ought to be joined as co-defendants.
That the defendant desired an extension of time to file a
demurrer or answer to the complaint, as he might be advised, to the 2nd of December, 1909.
An order was prayed making the People of Porto Rico a party, for service upon them, and that time for pleading be extended.
Subsequently defendant filed an answer denying each
and every material allegation of the complaint and prayed a dismissal of the action.
The case, by consent, was subsequently- set for trial and a jury empaneled. Thereupon Harvey M. Hutchinson, representing the Attorney General of Porto Rico, petitioned the court for a continuance of the trial for time to enable him to ascertain if the People of Porto Rico should be made a party defendant to the cause. In pursuance of the petition the court continued the case. Upon the date to which the cause was continued Hutchinson again, as representing the Attorney General of Porto Rico, appeared in behalf of the People of Porto Rico and represented to the court that the People of Porto Rico were interested parties to the action. The court thereupon ordered the People of Porto. Rico to be made a party. The jury was excused, the cause continued and the plaintiff (defendant in error) was "directed to amend his complaint so as to show the People of Porto Rico to be a party defendant."
An amended complaint was filed December 15, 1910.

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.

Opinion of the Court.

232 U. S.

It alleged the plaintiff to be a citizen of Porto Rico and the defendant "a body politic, created by the Congress of the United States being a citizen thereof." That plaintiff was the owner of a "rustic estate," describing it, and in possession thereof, and that one Eliza Kortright, since deceased,
ejected plaintiff therefrom and continued in possession thereof up to her death. That, therefore, her estate was placed under judicial administration under the direction of Eduardo Wood, as judicial administrator, which judicial administration ceased during the month of November, 1910, and the administrator discharged. That, therefore, the defendant, The People of Porto Rico, was adjudged by the District Court of San Juan the only heir to the estate of Eliza Kortright, as she left no heirs. That The People of Porto Rico, as such heir continues to possess the land without right or title thereto, against the will of plaintiff, and to his damage in the sum of $6000, which sum was prayed as rents and profits, together with restitution of the land.
Upon motion of the Attorney General of Porto Rico his name was entered as counsel for The People of Porto Rico and leave granted to file a demurrer.
The demurrer recited that the Attorney General appeared specially for the sole purpose of challenging the jurisdiction of the court in the case and demurred to the
amended complaint for the following reasons: (1) Because the suit was one between, plaintiff, a citizen of Porto Rico, and The People of Porto Rico as sole defendant, and that both plaintiff and defendant, being citizens of Porto Rico within the meaning of the act of Congress conferring jurisdiction on the court, the court had no jurisdiction. (2) Because The People of Porto Rico as a recognized entity, was so far a sovereign as to be exempt from suit at the instance of private individuals.
The demurrer was overruled and on the eleventh of January, 1911, an answer was filed in which defendant in-

232 U.S.

Opinion of the Court.

sisted and pleaded that it "had such attributes of sovereignty" as exempted it from suit. The rest of the answer denied the allegations of the complaint and set up judgments obtained in two separate suits brought by Eliza Kortright against defendant in error in which it was adjudged against him that she was the owner of the lands sued for by plaintiff in the present action.
The action was tried to a jury which found for plaintiff (defendant in error) and assessed damages at $6000, in accordance with which judgment was entered. A new trial was moved and denied, and this writ of error granted.
But one contention is argued, that is, that the District Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit against Porto Rico "without its consent and against its active opposition." Porto Rico v. Rosaly, 227 U. S. 270, is cited to sustain the contention. It was said in that case that the government "established in Porto Rico is of 'such a nature as to come within the general rule exempting a government sovereign in its attributes from being sued without its consent." This case, however, is not within the rule. In that case Porto Rico was a defendant in the first instance. In this case it voluntarily petitioned to be made a party, asserting rights to the property in controversy, and, against the opposition of the plaintiff (defendant in error), it was made a party defendant. And this action was not improvident. Its Attorney General took time to consider. He applied for and obtained a continuance of the case to determine the best course to secure the interests of the People of Porto Rico, whether to assert its rights in the then litigation or attempt to keep them under the immunity of its sovereignty from attack. His decision had the support of substantial reasons. The property came to Porto Rico as an escheat, and came therefore as it was held by Eliza Kortright and Wood. If held in wrong by them, it was held in wrong by it, and the Attorney General may have considered it well worth

while to face the controversy rather than remit it to some other proceeding that the plaintiff might institute, fortified, perhaps, by a decision in his favor. United States v. Lee, 106 U. S. 196; Stanley v. Schwalby, 147 U. S. 508.
But, whatever his reasons, he certainly asked for time, as we have seen, "to enable him to ascertain if the People of
Porto Rico should be made a party defendant" in the cause, and, having been granted the time, he appeared again in the cause and represented to the court that Porto Rico was an interested party to the action, and the court, having heard the arguments of opposing counsel, ordered
Porto Rico to be made a party and directed plaintiff to amend his complaint in execution of the order. Porto Rico, therefore, through its Attorney General, not only gave its consent to be a pdrty to the cause but invoked and obtained the ruling of the court against the resistance of
the plaintiff to make it a party to the cause. The complaint having been amended as moved and
directed and nearly a year having elapsed, there came a change of view, but the immunity of sovereignty from suit without its cohsent cannot be carried so far as to permit it to reverse the action invoked by it and to come in and go out of court at its will, the other party having no right of resistance to either step.
In placing our decision upon the consent of Porto Rico to be made a party defendant under the circumstances presented by this case, we do not wish to imply that Porto Rico could not have been made a party without its consent, the property being an escheat. As to that we express no opinion.
There is an assignment of error based on the proposition that by the amendment of the complaint the plaintiff and Porto Rico became the sole parties to the action, and they being citizens of Porto Rico the court lost jurisdiction of it. The proposition is not urged by plaintiff in error in its
brief, and if the proposition did not raise a question of

It is, however, enough to say of it that the original defendant Wood was properly sued, he then being a subject of Great Britain and in possession of the land.

ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE.
No. 339. Argued April 30, 1914.-Decided June 22, 1914.
The statute of Tennessee of 1865, c. 40, § 8, declaring that children of slave marriages should be legitimately entitled to inherit, as it has been construed by the highest, court of that State as not extending the right of inheritance beyond lineal descendants of the parents, is not unconstitutional under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Inheritance is not a natural or absolute right but the creation of statute and is governed by the lex rei sitce.
The rights of one claiming real property as heir, through an alien, a bastard or a slave, must be determined by the local law. Blythe v. Hinckley, 180 U. S. 333.
While a colored freedman in Tennessee could dispose of property acquired during freedom by deed or will and it descended to his issue, if any, if he died intestate, if no issue survived, it passed under the terms of the act of 1865 to his widow, if she survived, and not to his collateral relatives.
THE facts, which involve the construction and constitutionality under the Fourteenth Amendment of certain provisions of the laws of Tennessee in regard to the descent of real property, are stated in the opinion.

Opinion of the Court.

234 U. S.

One John Jones, a colored freedman, died in 1889, the owner of a tract of eighty-seven acres of land lying in
Shelby County, Tennessee, upon which he and his wife had lived for many years. He died intestate and without issue. The title to the land was claimed by his widow, the defendant in error, Marguerite Jones, who has since the death of John Jones inter-married with the other defendant in error, Albert Jones. Her claim was rested upon §4165, Shannon's Compilation of Tennessee laws, which provides that if one die intestate, "leaving no heirs at law capable of inheriting the real estate, it shall be inherited by the husband or wife in fee simple." The plaintiff in error, Will Jones, contested the claim of the widow, contending that the land passed to the surviving brothers and sisters of the intestate, under whom, through quit-claim deeds, he claimed the title. The widow's bill was for the purpose of cancelling these deeds as clouds upon her title. The Tennessee court sustained her bill and adjudged that the intestate having died without issue and without heirs at law capable of inheriting, his real estate passed to his widow under § 4165, supra.
The deeds denounced as clouds upon the widow's title
were attacked upon a number of grounds, among them fraud in their procuration. The decree ordering their cancellation was apparently based only upon the ground that their makers, assuming them to be legitimate full brothers and sisters of the intestate John Jones, were sons and daughters of a born slave and themselves born slaves, and as such were not his heirs within the meaning of the Tennessee statutes of descent.
There i4 a Tennessee statute of descent which provides that the land of an intestate shall pass to his brothers and sisters in case the owner die without issue, and the contention is that if this statute preferring the brothers and sisters of an intestate dying without issue over the husband or widow be construed as applying only to brothers and

Opinion of the Court.

sisters born free, it discriminates against those born slaves and thereby violates that equal protection of the law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.
This provision of the Tennessee canon of descent by which the brothers, and sisters of an intestate dying without issue take his real estate is as old as the State and comes from the common law. It does not distinguish in terms between brothers and sisters born free and those born slaves. Neither does it distinguish between those who are born bastards and those born in wedlock, and those who are aliens and those who are not. Nevertheless, neither a bastard nor an alien'has inheritable blood, nor are they capable of inheriting as heirs unless by aid of some statute: 2 Kent's Comm. * p. 211; 2 Blackstone's Commentaries, * p. 249; Lety y. McCartee, 6 Peters, 102. The civil status of slaves in Tennessee, as well as in other States in which slavery existed, was such as to disable them from inheriting or transmitting property by descent. Thus it was said, "They cannot take property by descent or purchase, and all they find and all they hold, belongs to the master. They cannot make lawful contracts, and they are deprived of civil rights. They are assets in the hands of executors, for the payment of debts." 2 Kent's Commentaries, 11th ed., 278, * p. 253; Jackson v. Lervey, 5 Cowen (New York), 397. Slaves, therefore, were not within the meaning and effect of the statutes of descent, and no descent from or through a slave was possible except as provided by some special statute. The rule was the same as to aliens and illegitimates.
After the emancipation of the slaves of the South the statutes of inheritance were extended in many States so as to confer upon the children of parents born in slavery the right to inherit from their parents But these enlargements of the canon of descent extended only to lineal descendants and did not embrace collaterals. The Ten-

nessee statute, which was claimed in the court below to be broad enough to embrace collateral relatives, is that of 1865-6, c. 40, § 5, carried into Shannon's Compilation as § 4179. That act declared that slaves who within the State had lived together as man and wife should be regarded as lawfully married, and that the children of such slave marriages should be "legitimately entitled to an inheritance in any property heretofore acquired, or that may hereafter be acquired by said parents, to as full an extent as the children of white citizens are entitled by. the laws of this State." But this statute has been more than once construed as not extending the right of ;nheritance beyond the lineal descendants of the parents: Sheperd v. Carlin, 99 Tennessee, 64; Carver v. Maxwell, 110 Tennessee, 75. In Sheperd v. Carlin, supra, the question here presented was decided. Agnes Lee, a colored woman, born in slavery, died intestate and without issue. Her land was claimed by her surviving husband under §4165, Shannon's Compilatior, heretofore referred to, and by her niece as her only collateral relative. The court held that the right to inherit the real estate of an intestate born in slavery had been extended only in favor of lineal descendants and that collaterals possessed no inheritable blood. To the same effect are many cases, among them: Tucker v. Bllamy,'98 No. Car. 31; Jones v. Hoggard, 108 No. Car. 1f8; Williams v. Kimball, 35 Florida, 49; S. C., 16 So. Rep. 783.
Inheritance is governed by the lex rei sit&. It is not a natural or absolute right, but the creation of statute law. If one claim the right to succeed to the real property of another as heir and his right is denied because he must trace his pedigree or title to or through an alien, a bastard or a slave, the question is one to be determined by the local law. Cope v. Cope, 137 U. S. 682. Levy v. McCartee,
supra. Blythe v. Hinckley, 180 U. S. 333. In Levy v. McCartee, supra, the question was oae of inheritance, the

plaintiff tracing his pedigree through an alien ancestor. After first deciding that a question of inheritance to land in New York, was one to be determined by the law of that State, the court held; first, that an alien had no inheritable blood and could neither take land himself by descent, nor transmit it to others; second, that under the law of New York one citizen of the State could not inherit in the collateral line of another when he must make his pedigree or title through a deceased alien ancestor.
It is true that the land of the intestate John Jones was acquired when he was a freedman. Under the law of the State when he acquired it. he had the right to dispose of it by deed or will. If he died intestate leaving issue, it descended to such issue. But if he left no such descendants, it passed, by the express terms of the statute, to his widow.
We are unable to see in the Tennessee Statute of Descent any such denial of the equal protection of the law as is prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment.
The decree is accordingly affirmed.

ORDER OF ST. BENEDICT OF NEW JERSEY v. STEINHAUSER, INDIVIDUALLY AND AS ADMINISTRATOR OF WIRTH.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.
No. 267. Argued. March 11, 1914.-Decided June 22, 1914.
In a suit by an ecclesiastical society to recover from the administrator of a deceased member assets of the estate as community property under the provisions of the constitution and membership, the question for the courts is not one of canon law or ecclesiastical polity, but one solely of civil rights.
Where the State has chartered a society as one of "religious men living in community," a provision in its constitution for community ownership, with renunciation of individual rights in private property during continuance of membership, with freedom of withdrawal, is not invalid as opposed to the public policy of, but is directly sanctioned by, the State creating the society.
An agreement to live in community and renounce individual rights of property, but with a right to withdraw at any time invades no constitutional right; nor, in this case, does it transgress any statute of the State of New Jersey which chartered the society with which the agreement is made.
Subject to the inhibitions of the Constitution of the United States the legislature of each State is the arbiter of its public policy.
In this case hed that an agreement made by a member of a religious order, chartered as a society of religious men living in community, that his individual earnings and acquisitions, like those of other members, should go into the common fund, included his earnings from copyrights of books; and also held, that as such agreement contained a right to withdraw at any time there was no infringement of any right protected by the Constitution of the United States nor was it against the public policy of the State of New Jersey which granted the charter to the society.

MR. JusTicE HUGHs delivered the opinion of the court.

This suit was brought by The Order of St. Benedict of New Jersey, a corporation of that State, to establish its title to personal property left by Augustin Wirth, deceased, a member of the Order who died at Springfield, Minnesota, in December, 1901. The defendant, Albert Steinhauser, as administrator of the estate of the decedent, holding letters from the Probate Court of Brown County, Minnesota, filed a cross-bill asserting ownership in his representative capacity and praying discovery and account with respect to whatever part of the estate had come into the complainant's possession. The Circuit Court entered a decree dismissing the cross-bill and granting the relief sought by the complainant's bill. 179 Fed. Rep. 137. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed this decree, directing the dismissal of the original bill and the granting of the prayer of the cross-bill. 194 Fed. Rep. 289. Certiorari was allowed.

of mandates essentially unchanged from the beginning. The vows are those of obedience, stability, chastity and poverty.
We are not concerned in the present case with any question of ecclesiastical requirement or monastic discipline. The question is solely one of civil rights. The claim in suit rests upon the constitution of the complainant corporation, and the obligations inherent in membership.
The Order of St. Benedict of New Jersey was incorporated in 1868 by special act of the legislature of that State. The incorporators were described as 'being a society of religious men living in community and devoted to charitable works and the education of youth.' The corporation was empowered to hold property and to make by-laws for the government of the Order, provided that these should not be repugnant to the Constitution of the United States or of the State of New Jersey, that the clear yearly income of the real estate should not exceed a sum stated, and that no one should remain an incorporator 'except regular- members of said religious society, living in community and governed by the laws thereof.' Under this charter the Order adopted a constitution, among the provisions of which are the following:
"Section XI. Membership is lost at once: "1. By. being dismissed according to the disciplinary
statutes of the Order of St. Benedict of New Jersey approved of by Pope Pius IX for the American Cassiness Congregation of Benedictines.
"2. By voluntarily leaving the Order for any purpose whatsoever.
"3. By joining any other order or secret society or any other religious denominations.
"Section XII. Since the Order of St. Benedict of New Jersey is solely a charitable institution, the real estate of said Order and the individual earnings of its members,
are and must be considered as common property of the

ST. BENEDICT ORDER v. STEINHAUSER. 643

234 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Order of St. Benedict of New Jersey from which the members of said Order derive their support and the balance of which income and property should serve for following up and carrying out the charitable objects of the Order.
"It is therefore agreed upon by all the members of the said Order of St. Benedict of New Jersey that no member can or will claim at any time or under any circumstances more than their decent support for the time for which they are members of the Charter of the Order of St. Benedict of New Jersey, and no further.
"And, moreover, that each member individually pledges himself to have all property, which he now holds or hereafter may hold, in his own name conveyed as soon as possible, to the legal title of the Order of St. Benedict of New Jersey."
Augustin Wirth was born in Bavaria in 1828. He came to this country in 1851; and, in the next year, he took the solemn vows of the Order at St. Vincent's Abbey in Pennsylvania and was ordained to the priesthood. For a few years he had charge of a church at Greenburgh, Pennsylvania, near St. Vincent's, and in 1857 he went to Kansas where he established a college and a church which afterwards became an abbey. He continued his' work in Kansas until 1868 and then. was sent to Minnesota where he remained until 1875. He then resumed his pastorate at Greenburgh, Pennsylvania, and later had charge of a parish at Elizabeth, New Jersey, until 1887. It is evident that while in Kansas he had joined the monastery of St. Benedict there established and in 1887, with the permission of both Abbots, he transferred his stability to St. Mary's Abbey in Newark, New Jersey, the home of the complainant, the New Jersey Order, of which he thus became a member. He remained continuously at this Abbey for about two years, until 1889; he was in ill-health and was taken care of by the Order. He was then sent to a church in Wilmington, Delaware, and after a few

months he returned to his pastorate in Elizabeth, New Jersey, in which he continued until 1897. After traveling for some time in Europe for his health, visiting Rome and various monasteries, he took a parish, in 1898, at ,Springfield, Minnesota, with the requisite permission ad tempus from the Abbot of St. Mary's; and there he remained until his death. At the request of the New Jersey Abbot he was buried in the cemetery of the Benedictine Order in Minnesota. The Circuit Court found that his membership in the complainant Order continued to the last, and this finding was not disturbed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. We regard the fact as satisfactorily established. His absence from the Abbey when engaged in pastoral work was upon the consent of the Abbot and he was sub-
ject to recall at any time. Father Wirth published many works on religious sub-
jects. He obtained copyrights for his books, and made his contract with the publishers, in the name of "Augustine Wirth, 0. S. B." The property here in question consists chiefly of the proceeds received from sales of these books (including notes and mortgages in which they had been invested), credits on account of sales made before and after his death, and the copyrights. He received the royalties personally during his lifetime; and after his death, until October 17, 1906 (when suit was brought against the publishers by the administrator), the accruing royalties were paid to the complainant. The New Jersey Order also, through the Abbot of St. John's Abbey in Minnesota, collected certain sums on outstand-
ing notes held by the decedent and paid therefrom the decedent's debts.
It is clear that, according to the principles of the complainant's organization, Father Wirth was not entitled to retain for his own benefit either the moneys which he received for his services in the various churches with which he was connected or those which he derived from

ST. BENEDICT ORDER v. STEINHAUSER. 645

234 U. S.

Opinioa of the Court.

the sale of his books. By the -explicit provision of the constitution of the complainant (§ XII), it was a necessary consequence of his continued membership, that his gains-from whatever source-belonged to it, and that as against the complainant he could not assert title to the property which he received. The claim of the Order, based upon this conception of its rights, is resisted upon the grounds, (1) that the decedent had the permission of the Abbot to retain, as his own property, the proceeds of the sales of his books, and (2) that the obligation sought to be enforced by the complainant is void as being against public policy.
1. While there was evidence that Father Wirth was required to account to the Abbot for the salary and perquisites received in his church work, it appeared that the income from his books was treated in a different manner. This income he was allowed to retain and use. When he joined the complainant, in 1887, he did not make a transfer of any property to the Order although already he had some property as a result of his literary labors. The evidence showed that he made loans and investments; and
from the moneys in his hands, he paid his personal expenses including his outlays on his visit to Europe. Because of his going to Rome without leave and his expenditures on this trip, he was admonished by the Abbot Primate, 0. S. B., who had already written to the Abbot of St. Mary's that Father Wirth should be required to account. But no such account was given, and it would seem that such disagreements as arose between the decedent and his ecclesiastical superiors in this country related to church moneys and not to the proceeds of book sales. The Circuit Court of Appeals, disagreeing with the finding of the Circuit Court, concluded that Father Wirth was permitted by the Abbot of St. Vincent's, and by the complainant's Abbot, to retain these proceeds as his own property.

OCTOBER TERM, 1913.

Opinion of the Court.

234 U. S.

It is undisputed that the decedent did have a special permission with respect to the use of this income. Originally given by the Abbot of St. Vincent's, it was continued by the Abbot-of St. Mary's. It was given in recognition of the fact that his literary work was in addition to the duties which he was normally required to perform. But, as we think, the conclusion of the court below does not give proper weight to the testimony as to the nature and scope of the privilege thus accorded. It was explicitly testified by the Abbot that Father Wirth was permitted to keep the moneys in question, not as his own, but to have their use for charitable purposes with the permission of his superiors. It was this permission which was originally given and which the complainant's Abbot renewed. This testimony was not controverted and, in view of the constitution of the Order, we find no ground for treating the permission as being of a different character. It is said that it does not appear how the decedent while in Minnesota, for example, could have expended the money for the charitable purposes of the Order in New Jersey. But the purposes of this Order were broadly charitable and religious; the decedent prosecuted his educational and religious work with the Abbot's consent and the use of these moneys for charitable purposes, wherever he was located for the time, might well be in furtherance of the objects of the Order. It may have been the concession of a special privilege to permit the decedent to act directly in the distribution of the moneys which he had earned by his additional labors, instead of turning them over to the head of the Order, but we cannot say that it was a permission without restriction or one which essentially altered his relation to the Order and his fundamental duty while he remained a member of it.
On the contrary, we agree with the Circuit Court, not only in its finding of fact that the permission was limited as stated, but also in its holding that in view of the basic

ST. BENEDICT ORDER v. STEINHAUSER. 647

234 U. S.

Opinion cf the Court.

law of the organization, there is no warrant for the conclusion that the Abbot had any authority to allow Father Wirth to assert an independent title or to hold the property as absolutely his own. It is said that the 'Rule of St. Benedict' recognizes the right of the member of the Order to keep whatever the Abbot permits him to have. But this plainly refers to the necessities of life and not to accumulations in direct antagonism to the principles of the society. Whatever indulgence may have been shown to the decedent with respect to the submission of? appropriate accounts, it cannot be said that while his membership continued he bad, or could have, the privilege of accumulating an individual estate for his own benefit and free from his obligations to the Order. This could not but be regarded as violative of the constitution of the complainant and beyond the competency of its official head to grant.
2. We are thus brought to the question whether the requirement, which lies at the foundation of this suit, is void as against public policy; that is, whether, by reason of repugnance to the essential principles of our institutions, the obligation though voluntarily assumed, and the trust arising from it, cannot be enforced. In support of this view, it seems to 'be premised that a member of
the Order can be absolved from his vows only by the action of the Head of the Church and that unless the requisite dispensation is thus obtained the member is bound for life in temporal, as wel as in spiritual, affairs. This, it is said, is the necessary import of testimony given by the Abbot. It is thus assumed that the vows in connection with the 'Rule' bind the member in complete servitude to the Order for life or until the Head of the Church
absolves him from his obligations; and it is concluded that an agreement for such a surrender, being opposed to individual liberty and to the inherent right of every person to acquire and hold property, is unenforceable in the civil

courts and cannot form the basis for an equitable title in the complainant.
This argument, we think, disregards the explicit provision of the complainant's constitution as to voluntary withdrawal. It overlooks the distinction between civil and ecclesiastical rights and duties; between the Order of St. Benedict of New Jersey, a corporation of that State, and the monastic brotherhood subject to church authority; between the obligation imposed by the corporate organization and religious vows. As we have said, the question here is not one of canon law or ecclesiastical polity. The requirement of complainant's constitution must be read according to its terms and its validity must be thus determined. Granted that it is to be examined in the light of that to which it refers, still, obligations which are inconsistent with its express provisions cannot be imported into it. This constitution, as already stated, definitely provides: "Membership is lost at once :-2. By voluntarily leaving the, Order for any purpose whatsoever." (Section XI.) This language cannot be taken to mean other than what it distinctly says. So far as the corporation, and the civil rights and obligations incident to membership therein, are concerned, it leaves no doubt that the member may voluntarily leave the Order at any time. His membership in the corporation, and the obligation he assumes, are subject to that condition. If he severs his connection with the corporation, it cannot be heard to claim any property he may subsequently acquire. His obligation runs with his membership and the latter may be terminated at will.
With this privilege of withdrawal expressly recognized, we are unable to say that the agreement--expressed in § XII of the complainant's constitution-that the gains and acquisitions of members shall belong to the corporation, must be condemned. These go to the corporation in exchange for the privileges of membership and

ST. BENEDICT ORDER v. STEINHAUSER. 649

to further the common purpose to which the members are devoted. No constitutional right is invaded and no statutory restriction is transgressed. The legislature of New Jersey which, subject to constitutional inhibition is the arbiter of the public policy of that State, granted the charter by special act to the Benedictine Society of 'religious men living in community' and it cannot be said that the constitution adopted by the Order was repugnant to the charter provisions or exceeded the authority plainly intended to be conferred. It would seem to be clear that the obligation assumed instead of being opposed to the public policy of the State where it was created was directly sanctioned.
The validity of agreements providing for community ownership with renunciation of individual rights of property during the continuance of membership in the community, where there is freedom to withdraw, has repeatedly been affirmed. The case of Goesele v. Bimeler, 14 How. 589, related to a religious society called Separatists. By an agreement made in 1819, the members of the society agreed to unite in a 'communion of property.' They renounced 'all individual ownership of property, present or future, real or personal.' Amendatory articles of like import were signed in 1824. As to these agreements, the court said: "The articles of 1819 and 1824 are objected to as not constituting a contract which a court of equity would enforce. . . . What is there in either of these articles that is contrary to good morals, or that is opposed to the policy of the laws? An association of individuals is formed under a religious influence, who are in a destitute condition, having little to rely on for their support but their industry; and they agree to labor in common for the good of the society, and a comfortable maintenance for each individual; and whatever shall be acquired beyond this shall go to the common stock. This contract provides for every member of the

community, in sickness and in health, and under whatsoever misfortune may occur. . . .- By disclaiming all individual ownership of the property acquired by their labor, for the benefits secured by the articles, the members give durability to the fund accumulated, and to the benevolent purposes to which it is applied. No legal objection is perceived to such a partnership." (Id., pp. 606, 607). In Schwartz v. Duss, 187 U. S.8, the controversy related to the property of the Harmony Society, a community in Pennsylvania. It was said that the cardinal principle of the society was 'self-abnegation,' which was manifested 'not only by submission to a religious head, but by a community instead of individual ownership of property, and the dedication of their labor to the society.' It had been held by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania
that the agreements constituting the community were not offensive to the public policy of that State (Schriber v. Rapp, 5 Watts, 351), and, as to this, it was said by this court: "The Supreme Court observed that the point made against the articles as being against public policy was attended with no difficulty, and Chief Justice Gibson said for the court: 'An association for the purposes expressed is prohibited neither by statute nor the common law."' (Id. p. 26.) In Burt v. Oneida Community, 137 N. Y. 346, in describing the character of that society, the Court of Appeals of New York said that its main purpose was the 'propagandism of certain communistic views as to the acquisition and enjoyment of property' and 'the endeavor to put into practical operation an economic and industrial scheme which should embody and illustrate the doctrines which they held and inculcated.' Necessarily, said the court (p. 353), "the basic proposition of such a community was the absolute and complete surrender of the separate and individual rights of property of the persons entering it; the abandonment of all purely selfish pursuits, and the investiture of the title to their

property and the fruits o:f their industry in the common body, from which they could not afterwards be severed or withdrawn except by unanimous consent. It was fashioned according to the pentecostal ideal, that all who believed should be together and have all things common. It was intended to be in fact, as they frequently styled themselves, but a single family upon a large scale with only one purse, where self was to be abjured and the general good alone considered." The court, viewing it solely as a business undertaking, held that the organization 'was not prohibited by any statute or in contravention of any law regulating the possession, ownership or tenure of property.' See also Speidel v. Henrici, 120 U. S. 377; Gasely v. Separatists, 13 Oh. St. 144; Waite v. Merrill, 4 Maine, 102; Gass v. Wilhite, 2 Dana (Ky.), 170; State v. Amana Society, 132 Iowa, 304; 8 L. R.

It is said that in these cases, the contracts had been fully performed, and that the effort was made either to partition or distribute the property of the society, or to recover the value of property which had been actually conveyed or services which had been rendered to it. But the validity of the agreements there in question, against the objection based upon public policy, was distinctly recognized.
In the present case, there was no infringement of Father Wirth's liberty or right to property. He did not withdraw from the Order. He had agreed, by accepting membership under the complainant's censtitution, that his individual earnings and acquisitions, like those of other members, should go into the common. fund and, except as required for the maintenance of the! members, should be used in carrying out the charitable objects of the Order. It is not unlikely that the copyrights upon his books derived their commercial value largely, if not altogether, from his membership.

The further objection that the claim is barred by the statute of limitations was held by the Circuit Court to be untenable and we agree with that view. The applicable limitation is six years (Revised Laws, Minnesota (1905), § 4076,) and the bill was filed within six years after Father Wirth's death. There is no such clear evidence of repudiation of the trust as would warrant the conclusion that the statute began to run at an earlier date.
The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and that of the Circuit Court is affirmed.
It is so ordered.

SELIG v. HAMILTON, RECEIVER OF EVANS, JOHNSON, SLOANE COMPANY.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
No. 361. Argued May 6, 1914.-Decided June 22, 1914.
The legislation of Minnesota with respect to the liability of stockholders, as construed by the courts of that State, has heretofore been reviewed and its constitutional validity upheld by this court in Bernheimer v. Converse, 206 U. S. 516, and Converse v. Hamilton, 224 U. S. 243.
A stockholder cannot, under the statutes of Minnesota, even by a bona fide transfer of his stock, escape liability for debts of the corporation theretofore incurred.
Bankruptcy proceedings against a Minnesota corporation do not stand in the way of a resort to the statutory method of enforcing the liability of a stockholder which is not a corporate asset.
Congress has not yet undertaken to provide that a discharge in bankruptcy of a corporation shall release the stockholders from liability.
