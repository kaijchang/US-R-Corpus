trade, every such combination, as well the small as the great, is within the act.
In view of my interpretation of the statute I do not go further into the question of the power of Congress. That has been dealt with by my brother White and I concur in the main with his views. I am happy to know that only a minority of my brethren adopt an interpretation of the law which in my opinion would make eternal the bellum omnium contra omnes and disintegrate society so far as it could into individual atoms. If that were its intent I should regard calling such a law a regulation of commerce as a mere pretense. It would be.an attempt to reconstruct society. I am not concerned with the wisdom of such an attempt, but I believe that Congress was not entrusted by the Constitution with the power to make it and I am deeply persuaded that it has not tried.

I am authorized to say that the CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE WHITE and MR. JUSTICE PECKHAM concur in this dissent.

MR. JUSTIcE HolMis delivered the opinion of the court.

The question in this case is whether the following instrument is entitled to probate:

"Washington, D. C. Aug. 31"/001.
"I am going on a Journey and may, not ever return. And if I do not, this is my last request. The Mortgage on the King House, wich is in the possession of Mr H H Brown to go to the Methodist Church at Bloomingburgh All the rest of my properday both real and personal to My adopted Son L. B. Eaton of the life Saving Service, Treasury Department Washington D. C, All I have is my one hard earnings and and I propose to leave it to whome I please. Caroline Holley."

The case was heard on the petition, an answer denying the allegations of the same, except on a point here immaterial, and

setting up that the residence of the deceased was in New York, and upon a stipulation that the instrument was written and signed by the deceased on August 31, 1901, and that she went on her journey, returned to Washington, resumed her occupation there as a clerk in the Treasury Department, and died there on December 17, 1901. Probate was denied by the Supreme Court with costs against the appellant, and this decree was affirmed by the Court of Appeals upon the ground that the will was conditioned upon an event which did not come to pass. It will be noticed that the domicil of the testatrix in Washington was not admitted in terms. But the Court of Appeals assumed the allegation of the petition that she was domiciled in Washington to be true, and obviously it must have been understood not to be disputed. The argument for the appellee does not mention the point. The petition also sets up certain subsequent declarations of the deceased as amounting to a republication of the will after the alleged failure of condition, but as these are denied by the answer they do not come into consideration here.
It might be argued that logically the only question upon the probate was the factum of the instrument. Pohiman v. Untzellman, 2 Lee, Eccl. 319, 320. But the practice is well settled to deny probate if it clearly appears from the contents of the instrument, coupled with the admitted facts, that it is inoperative in the event which has happened. Parsons v. Lanoe, 1 Ves. Sr. 189; S. C., Ambler, 557; 1 Wils. 243; Sinclairv. Hone, 6 Ves. 607, 610; Roberts v. Roberts, 2 Sw. & Tr. 337; Lindsay v. Lindsay, L. R. 2 P. & D. 459; Todd's Will, 2 W. & S. 145. The only question therefore is whether the instrument is void because of the return of the deceased from her contemplated journey. As to this, it cannot be disputed that grammatically and literally the words "if I do not" [return] are the condition of the whole "last request." There is no doubt either of the danger in going beyond the literal and grammatical meaning of the words. The English courts are especially and wisely careful not to substitute a lively imagination of what a testatrix

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.

Opinion of the Court.

193 U. S.

would have said if her attention had been directed to a particular point for what she has said in fact. On the other hand, to a certain extent, not to be exactly defined, but depending on judgment and tact, the primary import of isolated words may be held to be modified and controlled by the dominant intention to be gathered from the instrument as a whole. Bearing these opposing considerations in mind, the court is of the opinion that the will should be admitted to proof.
"Courts do not incline to regard a will as conditional where it can be reasonably held that the testator was merely expressing his inducement to make it, however inaccurate his use of language might be, if strictly construed." Damon v. Damon, 8 Allen, 192, 197. Lord Penzance puts the same proposition perhaps even more strongly in In the Goods of Porter, L. R. 2 P. & D. 22, 23; and it is almost a common place. In the case at bar we have an illiterate woman writing her own will. Obviously the first sentence, "I am going on a journey and may not ever return," expresses the fact which was on her mind as the occasion and inducement for writing it. If that had been the only reference to the journey the sentence would have had no further meaning. Cody v. Conly, 27 Gratt. 313. But with that thought before her, it was natural to an un-
educated mind to express the general contingency of death in the concrete form in which just then it was presented to her imagination. She was thinking of the possibility of death or she would not have made a will. But that possibility at that moment took the specific shape of not returning from her journey, and so she wrote "if I do not return," before giving her last commands. We need not consider whether if the will had nothing to qualify these words, it would be impossible to get away from the condition. But the two gifts are both of a kind that indicates an abiding and unconditioned intentone to a church, the other to a person whom she called her adopted son. The unlikelihood of such a condition being attached to such gifts may be considered. Skipwilh v. Cabell, 19 Gratt. 758, 783. And then she goes on to say that all that

EATON v. BROWN.

193 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

she has is her own hard earnings and that she proposes to leave it to whom she pleases. This last sentence of self-justification evidently is correlated to and imports an unqualified disposition of property, not a disposition having reference to a special state of facts by which alone it is justified and to which it is confined. If her failure to return from the journey had been the condition of her bounty, an hypothesis which is to the last degree improbable in the absence of explanation, it is not to be believed that when she came to explain her will she would not have explained it with reference to the extraordinary contingency upon which she made it depend instead of going on to give a reason which on the face of it has reference to an unconditioned gift.
It is to be noticed that in the leading case cited for the opposite conclusion from that which we reach, Parsons v. Lanoe, Lord Hardwicke emphasizes the proposition that under the circumstances of that case no Court of Equity would give any latitude to support such a will. There the will began "in case I should die before I return from the journey I intend, God willing, shortly to undertake for Ireland." The testator then was married but had no children. He afterwards returned from Ireland and had several children. If the will stood the children would be disinherited, and that was the circumstance which led the Lord Chancellor to say what we have mentioned, and to add that courts would take hold of any words they could to make the will conditional and contingent. Ambler, 561; 1 Ves. Sr. 192. It is to be noticed further that in the more important of the other cases relied on by the appellees the language or circumstances confirmed the absoluteness of the condition. For instance, "my wish,
desire, and intention, now is that if I should not return, (which I will, no preventing Providence)." Todd's Will, 2 W. & S. 145. There the language in the clearest way showed the alternative of returning to have been present to the testator's mind when the condition was written, and the will was limited further by the word "now." Somewhat similar was In the

CHARLES McINTIRE v. EDWIN A. McINTIRE.
EDWIN A. McINTIRE v. CHARLES McINTIRE.
APPEALS FROM, AND IN ERROR TO, THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
Nos. 84, 85. Argued December 8, 1903.-Decided January 4, 1904.
A testator left a residue "to be equally divided between my brothers Edwin and Charles children." At the date of the will the brother Edwin had died leaving six children, five of whom survived the testator. Charles had two children and he and one of his children survived the testator.
Held that the residue was to be divided per capita. Counsel was retained to uphold the will at the petition of legatees, in-
cluding the administrator with the will annexed, and was paid by order of court, the payments being charged by him against the interest of these legatees without prejudice to an application to have them charged against the estate. In the final account, the payments were charged against the estate and his accounts were allowed. Held that the charge was proper. An order of court was made by consent that the administrator with the will annexed should act as such, but without commission or other charge, the assets being in other hands. When the debts were paid the assets

were transferred to him by another order on his giving a new and larger bond. Held that he was entitled to no commissions notwithstanding the change
made by the later order. Partial distributions are charged against special pecuniary legacies, not
against the interest of the legatees in the residue. Interest properly is charged against an administrator for money which the
record shows to be due from him to the estate.

cases cited in Farmerv. Kimball, 46 N. H. 435, on this use of
the word. Extraneous evidence under the circumstances surrounding
this case was not admissible to show the intent of a testator. We submit that such evidence is inadmissible. See Weather-

The allowance of commissions is a matter peculiarly within the province of the Orphans' Court, which has a close-at-hand view of the administration of the estate; and so far as discretion is vested in that court, its exercise is not subject to appeal.

MR. JusTIcE, HoLlies delivered the opinion of the court.

These are cross appeals from the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia. 14 App. D. C. 337. To avoid all questions of form there are also writs or error on the same grounds. The appeal of Charles McIntire is from the overruling of exceptions to the final account of the administrator with the will annexed of the estate of David McIntire, and presents two

OCTOBER TER]A, 1908.

Opinion of the Court.

192 U. S.

questions, one of construction and one of administration outside the terms of the will. The probatd of the will already has been before this court. 162 U. S. 383.
The question of construction is the main one. It is whether the children of the testator's brothers, Edwin and Charles, take per capita or per stirpes under the residuary clause of the following will:

"January 7th, 1880. "This is my last will and testament. "I David IcIntire. tin-plate worker, of this city (of) do will, bequeath, or devise, to my nephews, and nieces, that is to say, from July the first. 1st eighteen hundred and fifty-four. 1854 "To the opening of. on reading of this, paper. one thousand three hundred and fifty dollars and sixty-four cents ($1,350.64) is to be calculated at six (6) per cent. interest "That amount whatever it may be is to be given to each of my brother Edwin's children. The remainder if any, is to be equally divided between my Brothers Edwin and Charles children. David McIntire." There was an addition and also an earlier document of January 1, 1880, which it is unnecessary to copy. At the date of the will the brother Charles was living and had two sons, Charles and Henry, the latter of whom died before the testator. The brother Edwin had died, leaving six children, one of whom died before the testator. The testator held promissory notes of his brother Charles for°S1350.63. The brother Charles also now is dead. The argument for a division per stirpesis this. Earlier in the paper the testator had used the phrase "nephews and nieces," which it would have been natural to repeat had he intended to make a division per capita. But instead of that he says "my brothers Edwin and Charles children," which is not very different from "my brother Edwin's children and my brother Charles' children," and orders an equal division "between" them. "Between," if accurately used, imports that not more

Opinion of the Court.

than two persons or groups are set against each other, Ihrie's Estate, 162 Pa. St. 369, 372; Records v. Fields, 155 Missouri, 314, 322, and those groups are earmarked and shown to be regarded as groups by naming the parents from which respectively they come.- The equality of division is an equality between the groups. See Hall v. Hall, 140 Massachusetts, 267, 271. This mode of distribution has the recommendation that it follows the rule in cases of intestacy. Raymond v. Hillhouse, 45 Connecticut, 467, 474. See further Alder v. Beall, 11 G. &J. 123, explained in Plummer v. Shepherd, 94 Maryland, 466, 470. But the court is of opinion that the general rule of construction must prevail according to which, in the case of a gift to the children of several persons described as standing in a certain relation to the testator, the objects of the gift take per capita and not per stirpes. Walker v. Griffin, 11 Wheat. 375, 379; Balcom, v. Haynes, 14 Allen, 204; Hill v. Bowers, 120 Massachusetts, 135. The fact that one of the parents was living at the date of the will is deemed sufficient to exclude a reference to the statute of distributions. Blackler v. Webb, 2 P. Wins. 383; Bryant v. Scott, 1 Dev. & Bat. Eq. (N. C.) 155, 157. And with regard to the word "between," the will is an illiterate will, and as the popular use of the word is not accurate no conclusion safely can be based upon that. See Maddox v. State, 4 H. & J. 539; Brittain v. Carson, 46 Maryland, 186; Collins v. Feather, 52 W. Va. 107; Lord v. Moore, 20 Conriecticut, 122; Pitney v. Brown, 44 Illinois, 363; Farmerv. Kimball, 46 N. H. 435, 439; Burnet v. Burnet, 30 N. J. Eq. 595; Myres v. Myres, 23 How. Pr. 410; Waller v. Forsythe, 1 Phillips' Eq. (N. C.) 353.
The other error assigned on behalf of Charles McIntire is that the court charged the estate with $11,500, fees paid to counsel for services in defending the will against the attack of the said Charles and his father. The amount was paid in different sums by orders of court, in several instances on the petition of the children of Edwin, one of whom was the administrator with the will annexed, and was directed to be charged

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.

Opinion of the Court.

192 U. S.

against the interest of those children in the first instance, but without prejudice to an application to have it finally charged
against the estate. On the allowance of the account it was
charged against the estate. We are of opinion that the charge was proper. There is no contest over the amount. It was
the proper business and duty of the administrator to defend the will, and he was entitled to a reasonable allowance for what he had to pay in doing so. The only just alternative would be to charge counsel fees as costs against the losing party, which would have been less favorable to the appellant. The general proposition is not disputed, but it is said that in this case the legatees retained the counsel and therefore ought to pay them. The other legatees as well as the administrator no doubt had a share in calling the counsel in. But that did not matter. The services were services to the estate in main-
taining the testator's will, they were adopted by the administrator and the usual rule must prevail. It is said that there was no application to change the original order and no chance to be heard against it. But plainly this cannot be true. As observed by the court below, allowing the account changed the order and charged the fees on the estate. Whatever want of formality there may have been, the appellant had the right and opportunity to object and except to the account, as well on this ground as others, and he used it. The precise mode in which the allowance appeared upon the account is not material, but may be explained in a word or two. The payments were made by the solicitors of the parties while they had the assets in their hands, as will be stated in a moment. They rendered their account, crediting themselves with those payments gen-
erally. Then they turned over the assets, less these payments and their commissions, to the administrator. In the account of the latter he charges himself only with the net amount received by him, and makes no charge for the counsel fees against the legatees, and thus throws the burden on the residue
of the estate.
The foregoing considerations dispose of the appeal of Charles

McINTIRE v. MoINTIRE.

192 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

McIntire. There is a cross-appeal by the administrator from the allowance of certain exceptions to the account. The first error assigned is that he was denied commissions. The reason was this. On February 19, 1885, pending the controversy on the will and other controversies, an order was made by consent of all parties, to the effect,, among other things, that Edwin A. McIntire should act as administrator, "but without any allowance for commission or other charge for his services as such administrator," and that the assets should remain under the control of the court (they having been paid into court under another order of the same date, passed in an equity cause). The next year, all debts having been paid except a disputed note, another order was made by consent, turning over the assets to the solicitors of the parties. The funds. were managed by the solicitors until the will was established, when on petition of the administrator offering to give an additional bond, the assets were put into his hands on July 7, 1896, upon his filing a bond for $100,000. It is argued that this restoration of the assets to the hands of the administrator with the duty of distribution and the requirement of a new bond, relieved him of the terms of the bargain on which it was agreed that he should act, if that bargain ever was valid. We think it enough to say that we perceive no such change of situation from what was anticipated as should have that result. Whether the bargain was good or bad, the services were rendered under it, and therefore purported to be gratuitous. The law does not forbid gratuitous services, even in fiduciary relations, and if acts purport to be done gratuitously no claim for payment can be founded upon them at a later date. See Johnson v. Kimball, 172 Massachusetts, 398, 400, 401.
A partial distribution was made under an order of December 9, 1897, of $2800 to each of the children of Edwin, and of $6022.02 to Charles Mclntire. Complaint is made because the sums paid to Edwin's children were charged against the legacies to them instead of against their share in the residue, whereas the payment to Charles was charged to his share in

OCTOBER TERM, 1908.

Opinion of the Court.

192 U. S.

the residue, which was all he had. It is said that this mode stops the running of interest on the legacies to the disadvantage of the legatees. But we see no ground for complaint. Of course the liabilities of the estate in the form of legacies as well as those in the form of debts are to be satisfied before the residue exists. In the absence of a definite understanding at the time, partial payments naturally would be taken as working that satisfaction and as stopping the liability of the estate for interest. The same principle applies to another sum which four of the legatees agreed to treat as having been paid to them
as stated below. A third error alleged concerns $500, part of the counsel fees
in addition to the sums mentioned above. This was paid upon a petition of Edwin's children, stating that the counsel "had been managing their interests," and under an order directing the same to be charged to their distributive shares without reserving any right to apply to have it finally charged to the estate. We are not disposed to overturn the decision that this payment must be borne by the legatees, as they were content to be charged with it in the order allowing the payment.
The next error assigned is that the administrator was charged with interest on an item of $10,000 from April 18, 1884, to February 25, 1885. This sum was alleged to have been received by the administrator and improperly omitted from the inventory. The matter was referred to arbitrators. In order to avoid a family quarrel, if possible, the four sisters of the administrator agreed to be charged with $2500 each, as on a partial distribution, and gave receipts on February 25, 1885. Thereupon the administrator requested the arbitrators to find that he received and must account for the sum, and they did so. Very probably the matter of interest was overlooked, but the result of the transaction is that the administrator stands charged on the record as owing the estate $10,000 until the time of distribution to the sisters, and of course that he must pay interest at the legal rate. It is not a case of charging interest not earned against an administrator having funds in his

hands as such, but it is a charge against him for money which he ought to have put into his account and held as an identified fund, but did not. The motives which induced his consent to charge himself are immaterial. Whatever they were, the effect of the record is the same.
Finally, the administrator objects to being charged with interest on an item of $1419.73, which he received in 1891. There is perhaps more doubt about this than concerning the more important matters, but we shall not disturb the decree. The assets had been ordered to be paid into court and then had been transferred, as above stated, to the solicitors of the parties as custodians. The administrator did not pay this sum over, but kept it in his own hands.
Decree affirmed.

ELDER v. HORSESHOE MINING AND MILLING COMPANY.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA.
No. 220. Submitted April 18, 1904.-Decided May 2,1904.
A notice to a cobwner, to contribute his share of' development work on a mining claim, when rightfully published under § 2324 is effective in cutting off the claims of all parties and the title is thus kept clear and free from uncertainty and doubt. Claims for more than one year may be grouped in one notice.
It is not necessary for the notice to delinquent cobwners required by § 2324, Rev. Stat., to specifically name the heirs of a deceased cobwner, but is sufficient if addressed to such coowner, "his heirs, administrators and to whom itmay concern," even though an administrator had not been appointed at the time.
A notice published every day except Sundays, commencing' Monday, January 7, and ending Monday, April 1, held to have been published once a week for ninety days and to be sufficient under § 2324, Rev. Stat.
THE plaintiffs in error, being, the administrator, together with the heirs at law of Rufus Wilsey, deceased, commenced this suit in the state court of South Dakota against the defendants, and upon the trial the complaint was dismissed upon the merits; that judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State, and the plaintiffs have brought the case here. The action was commenced to obtain a decree that defendants held in trust for the plaintiffs in error an undivided one-half interest in and to the land embraced in what is called in the complaint the Golden Sand lode mining claim, the plaintiffs asked for a decree that the defendants should convey to the plaintiff in

error, Elder, administrator, an undivided one-half interest therein, and for such other and further relief as might be just and equitable.
The answer contained a denial of the various allegations of the complaint and set up a defence of laches on the part of the plaintiffs in error in asserting their claim. The case went to trial before the court, and the following facts were found:
In January, 1878, Rufus Wilsey and Charles H. Havens located a mining claim near Bald Mountain, in the Whitewood mining district, Lawrence County, South Dakota, by discovering mineral-bearing rock in place, sinking a shaft, posting discovery notices and planting boundary stakes; and on May 13 of the same year they filed for record their location certificate, which was then recorded. On June 12,1878, Wilsey died, and soon thereafter the plaintiffs, his heirs at law, were informed of his death. They knew that he had left property, and from a time shortly after his death corresponded with different attorneys and others residing in the Black Hills, trying to get something out of the estate, but, until the arrangement was made with the attorneys under which this action is brought, made no progress toward a settlement. From the time of the death of Wilsey, in 1878, up to December, 1893, the heirs of Wilsey did nothing toward contributing or offering to contribute toward paying for the annual labor made necessary by the Federal statute, Rev. Stat. sec. 2324; 2 Comp. Stat. p. 1426, in order to keep possession of the mine. On June 19, 1878, one Evans was appointed special administrator of the estate of Wilsey, and his letters were subsequently revoked, and one Stevens was appointed and filed his bond as administrator on August 13, 1881. Subsequently, on an allegation of the death of Stevens, some time in 1888, the present administrator was appointed on the twelfth of August, 1893.
In 1889, or soon thereafter, processes for the successful treatment of all mining ores, including such ore as was found in the ground in controversy, were introduced in Lawrence
County, and as a consequence the value of the mining property

therein was materially enhanced, and this property became of much greater value in August, 1892, and December, 1893,
than at any time since its location. On December 5, 1893, the plaintiffs in error by their attorneys
served on the defendant company an offer in writing to pay $700 for annual development and assessment work, and if that was not the correct amount of the expense for protecting their half interest in the Golden Sand lode, then they offered to pay the full amount due for the protection of the half interest of the plaintiffs in error, and they asked for a receipt, and demanded
a deed for such half interest. The offer and the request were. refused, and this action was begun on December 6, 1893.
From the time of the location of the mine up to 1888, inclusive, Havens, the codwner with Wilsey, did at least one hundred dollars' worth of labor each year in order to hold the claim, and filed on January 2, 1889, an affidavit to that effect, including the time from 1880 to and including the year 1887, and another affidavit to the same effect for the year 1888. Under the statute he publisheV a notice directed to "Rufus Wilsey, his heirs, administrators, and to all whom it may concern," informing them that he had expended $800 in labor upon the mine for the years ending December 31, 1880, 1881, 1882, 1883, 1884,-1885, 1886 and 1887, and stating that if within ninety days after this notice by publication they failed to'contribute their proportion, $400, being $50 for each of said years, their interest in said claim would become the property of the subscriber under section 2324 of the Revised Statutes of the United States. Havens also published for the year 1888 a notice similar to the one already given in regard to the work done prior to that year. The two notices were published in the proper newspaper and were set out in full and published in each daily issue of the paper, (every day in the week except Sunday,) beginning Monday, January 7, 1889, and concluding Tuesday, April 2, 1889, and no more. Havens also continued during the years 1889, 1890, 1891, and 1892, to do at least $100 worth of
work in the mine for the purpose of holding the same. On

Argument for Plaintiffs i' Error.

August 10, 1892, Havens made a deed of the whole lode and mining claim to one Thomas H. White, and on August 25, 1892, White caused to be filed for record an affidavit of Havens, which recited that he was one of the locators of the Golden Sand lode and that Wilsey, his co6wner, and whom he advertised out for not contributing his proportion of labor, had not paid his proportion nor any of the expenditures for holding the
claim. Questions were made as to the sufficiency of the notices and
as to the regularity of the publication of the same under the above statute of the United States. The case was tried once before and resulted in a judgment for plaintiffs, which was reversed by the Supreme Court of the State, 9 S.Dak. 636, and upon the new trial the judgment was for the defendants. 15 S.

Mr. Ebei W. Martin and Mr. Norman T. Mason for plaintiffs in error:
The notice of forfeiture was not sufficiently addressed. If there is any doubt as to the interprotation of the forfeiture provision of § 2324, the statute should be construed strictly as against defendants because it is a statute of forfeiture.

194 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE PECKHAM, after making the above statement of facts, delivered the opinion of the court.

The Federal questions which arise in this case are based upon
the statute of the United States already referred to in the fore-
going statement of facts, being section 2324 of the Revised Statutes, the material portion of which is set forth in the
margin..
The plaintiffs in error contend that the notices published by or in behalf of the defendants in error were not a compliance with the statute, because of the manner in which they were addressed. They also insist that, even assuming the sufficiency of the notices, they were not published in accordance with the
Rev. Stat. sec. 2324; as amended 21 Stat. 61, c. 9, 2 Comp. Stat. p. 1426. On each claim located after the tenth day of May, eighteen hundred and seventy-two, and until a, patent has been issued therefor, not less than one hundred dollars' worth of labor shall be performed or improvements made during each yeor. On all claims located prior to the tenth day of May, eighteen hundred and seventy-two, ten dollars' worth of labor shall be performed or improvements made by the tenth day of June, eighteen hundred and seventy-four, and each year thereafter, for each one hundred feet in length along the vein until a patent has been issued therefor; but where such claims are held in common, such expenditure may be made upon any one claim; and upon a failure to comply with these conditions, the claim or mine upon which such failure occurred shall be open to relocation in the same manner as if no location of the same had ever been made, provided that the original locators, their heirs, assigns or legal representatives, have not resumed work upon the claim after failure and before such location. Upon the failure of any one 'of several co-owners to contribuite his proportion of the expenditures required hereby, the co-owners -who have performed the labor or made the improvements may, at the expiration of the year, give such delinquent co-owner personal notice in writing, or notice by publication in the newspaper published nearest, the claim, for at least once a week for ninety days, and if at the expiration of ninety days after such notice in writing or by publication such delinquent should fail or refuse to. contribute his proportion of the expenditure required by this section, his interest in the claim shall become the property of his co-owners who have made the required expenditures. Provided, That the period within which the work required to be done annually on all unpatented mineral claims shall commence on the first day of January succeeding the date of location of such claim, and this section shall apply to all claims located since the tenth day of May, Anno Domini eighteen hundred and seventy-two.

OCTOBER TERM, 1903.

194 U. S.

requirements of the statute for a sufficient length of time, and that, therefore, the title of the plaintiffs in error was not divested. We are not impressed with the validity of either of
the two objections. As to the first. The notice was.addressed as follows: "To
Rufus Wilsey, his heirs, administrators, and to all whom it may concern." The objection made is that at the time when this notice was ppblished, Rufus Wilsey was dead, and there was no administrator then existing and th-names of the heirs were not given, and the notice, "to whom it may concern," was futile.
The statute, it will be observed, does not require that the
published notice in regard to a deceased co6wner shall be directed to any one by name. Upon--the failure of a co6wner to contribute his proportion of the expenditure required under the section, the c6owner who has performed the labor or made the improvements may, as provided for by the section, at the expiration of the year, give such delinquent co6wner personal notice in writing or notice by publication in the newspaper published nearest the claim, and if at the expiration of ninety days after such notice in writing, or by publication, the delinquent refuses to contribute his proportion or fails to do so, his interest in the claim thereby becomes the property of his coowners who have made the required expenditures. We perceive no possible har'i arising from the fact that the notice itself, containing all the facts necessary to be included therein, was addressed to "Rufus Wilsey, his heirs, administrators aid to whom it may concern." The fact that Rufus Wilsey was dead was not material so far as to thereby render the notice to his heirs illegal or insufficient. It certainly did them no harm
to include the name of Rufus Wilsey, and the notice was quite as likely to become known to them as if it had been addressed "to the heirs of Rufus Wilsey, deceased, his administrators, and to all whom it may concern." It is entirely unlike the publication of a summons for the purpose of commencing an action against a particular individual or individuals. There the identification must be complete and the person particularly de-

ELDER v. HORSESHOE MINING & MILLING CO. 255

Opinion of the Court.

scribed and named, so that when the publication has been
finished it can be known that the particular individual has been served with process by publication with the same effect as if it had been personally served on the same individual without publication. This statute provides a summary method for the purpose of insuring the proper contribution of codwners among themselves in the working of the mine, and it provides a means by which a delinquent co6wner may be compelled to contribute his share under the penalty of losing his right and title in the property because of such failure. It was not necessary, in our judgment, that the notice should specifically name the heirs of the. deceased owner. The act does not require it. If the notice be such that the former owner is particularly named and identified thereby, and his heirs are notified by the publication, it is a sufficient notice to them for the purpose of making it necessary for them to comply with, the terms of the statute within the time designated therein by the payment of their
share of the expenses of working the mine, or else to lose their right, title and interest therein. The codwner who did the work might not know who the heirs were, and it might be im-
possible for him to learn their names or whereabouts, and the statute never contemplated that the man who did the work should be prevented from obtaining the benefit of the statute by his inability to learn who the heirs were and where they lived. A.general address to the heirs of the person named and the proper publication of the notice, is sufficient. It did not become insufficient because in addition to being addressed to
them it was also addressed to their intestate by name. An address to a deceased person did them no harm, so long as At was also addressed to them.
The Supreme Court of South Dakota has held in this case that at the time this notice was published the title to a one-half interest in this claim was in the heirs, subject to a possible lien of the administrator for administration purposes, and had been since 'the death of Wilsey. 9 S. Dak. 636, 642. The same court has held that an administrator has but a lien on real

estate for administrative purposes, and that the title vests in the heirs. (Cases cited in opinion of the state court.) The only debt, so far as the record shows, existing against the estate ,of Wilsey was one for $50, in favor of Stevens, who was appointed administrator in 1881, and died in 1888, and from then until 1893 there was no administrator, the present one being appointed evidently for the purpose of this suit. The actual title to the fee is in the government, but the interest of the miner may be conveyed and inherited. Black v. Elkhorn Mining Company,. 163 U. S. 445, 449. We are of opinion that the publication of the notice was sufficient, although there was no administrator at the time of publication. It is unnecessary under this statute to publish a notice to lienors. We agree with the Supreme Court of the State that the evident purpose and object of the law of 1872 (section 2324) were to encourage the exploration and development of the mineral lands of the United States and the sale of the same, and that all the provisions of the law having been framed with that object in view, if the required work is not performed, after the expiration of the year, and notice of contribution properly served or sufficiently published, the rights of delinquents are absolutely cut off, though the failure to do the work may have been caused by the death of the locator or locators during the year. When a notice has been rightfully published under the statute it becomes effective in catting off the claims of all parties, and the title is thus kept clear and free from uncer-
tainty and doubt. There was no irregularity in grouping in one notice claims
for more than one year's expenditures. We can perceive no reason why a consolidation of the claims of several years should not be made and included in one and the same notice.
(2.) The objection to the sufficiency of the publication of the
notice we regard as equally unfounded. The statute provides for a publication "for at least once a week for ninety days." The publication was in fact made every day, except Sunday, in the proper newspaper, beginning Monday, January 7, 1889,

ELDER v. HORSESHOE MINING & MILLING CO. 257

19I U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

and concluding Tuesday, April 2, 1889. And the statute provides that if, after the expiration of ninety days after such notice in writing or publication, such delinquent should fail or refuse to contribute his proportion .of the expenditure required by this section, his interest in the claim shall become the property of his co6wners who have made the required expenditures. The publication, we think, was sufficient. The ninety day
period begins with the first publication; in this case, Monday, January 7. The publication on that day was sufficient for the week then beginning. The publication on January 15 was sufficient for that week, and, as stated by the Supreme Court of South Dakota: "Each succeeding Monday would certainly constitute at least one publication each week while so continued. There was a publication on each Monday from January 7 to April 1, both inclusive. If no publication was required after the first until the following Monday, none was required after April 1 until the following Monday, April 8, and on that day the period of ninety days had been completed. Including
the first day of publication, ninety days ended on Saturday, April 6. Excluding the first day, ninety days ended on Sunday, April 7. On that day the required notice had continued during ninety days, and another publication on Monday, April 8, was wholly unnecessary."
We are satisfied that this construction is the correct one, and the publication was, therefore, made for a sufficient length of time to comply with the statute.
The judgment of the Supreme Court of South Dakota is Affirmed.
