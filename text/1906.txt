If he elect to relet he must make "an honest and reasonable attempt to relet." And this is a reasonable and just exaction. It is the spirit as well as the letter of the covenant, fulfilling its security without unnecessary loss to the lessee.

APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

A trust in a will in favor of testator's four daughters and "from and after their death " for the '"children of each of them," and in which the idea of provision for the grandchildren is especially prominent, will not be construed, by rigidly giving plurality to the pronoun " their," as creating a joint tenancy so that the last surviving daughter takes all the income to the exclusion of'the children of her sisters previously deceaced.

and four daughters, Catherine E., then the wife of Samuel Owen, Susan, Ann (appellant) and Louisa. The widow of the deceased died May 13, 1876;. Louisa died January 2, 1876; Susan tied Deceinber 31, 1900, and Catherine E. Owen died May 14, 1901. Susan and Louisa never married, nor has Ann up to the present time. Catherine E. Owen left surviving her three daughters, Evania F. Mackall and the appellees, Kate D. Owen and Jessie Owen Cugle. The property produces an income of $11,000 or $12,000.
The question in the case is whether appellant succeeded to the whole estate upon the death of Catherine E. Owen, or whether the children of the latter, appellees, were the successors of their mother.
The wil .gives small legacies to two nephews, and disposes of "all the rest and residue and remainder of the testator's estate to Susan Cruit in trust (1) for his wife for and during her life, and topermit her to take-and receive the whole income, thereof; (2) in trust, as to testator's real estate, to his daughters equally, share and share alike, for and during their respective lives, . . . and from and after their death in trust for the child or children of each of my said daughters, then alive, in fee simple, such child or children, respectively, to take the share to which his, her or their parent was entitled. And if any of my said daughters shall die without having been married, her share shall pass to her or their surviving sisters or sister foi- life equally, and upon her or their death the same shall vest in her or their child or children in the same manner and for the same estate and pass on her or their death, as her or their original share or shares."
We do not think it is difficult to discern the intention of the testator. There is very little ambiguity in the will. If ambiguity exist it is in the pronoun "their" in the provision "and from and after their death in trust for the child or children of each of my said daughters then living in fee simple, such
shill be appointed Iy the Circuit Court so that the trusts hereby created slhall be at all times preserved and carried into effect.

child or children respectively to take the share to which his, her or their parent was entitled." It is contended by appellant that it is manifest from these words and others in the will that it was drawn by a skillful hand to create a joint tenancy in the daughters of the testator, and cases are cited in which wills containing such words have been construed, it is contended, as giving such effect. We might review these cases and those cited in opposition by appellees if the will in controversy were less clear in its meaning. Provision for his daughters and equality between them were clear and definite in the mind of the testator. One daughter was married and that the others might be was contemplated, and that children might result therefrom. This idea is especially prominent and is carefully expressed fnd provision is made for such children. The contention of appellant militates against this idea. It would leave grandchildren unprovided for. If such had been the intention of the testator, we think, he would have explicitly expressed it. It was not so natural an intention as the other. It is not the first impression of the will, and can only be made out by rigidly giving plurality to the pronoun "their" in the provision "and from .and after their death in trust for the child or children of each of my said daughters, then living, in fee simple." But the word is qualified and made several by what precedes it. The devise is to his daughters "for and during their respective lives." It is qualified also by what follows it. One of the daughters of the testator was married, the others were not, and might not be, and anticipating this possibility the testator provided that if any. of his daughters should die without having been married her share should pass to the survivors. In other words, it was only upon the death of a daughter "without having been married" (and without issue possibly), that her share was to pass to her sisters or sister. We also agree with the courts below that the trust continues.
The concluding paragraph of the will is: "And lastly I appoint my said daughter Susan Cruit sole

This ruling as to the separability of the statute is conclusive,

and refutes the contention that the entire law is void even upon

the hypothesis that the creation of presumptions as to one

class not applicable to another class or classes was repugnant

to the Fourteenth Amendment.

It remains only to consider the contentions that the statute

upon which the conviction was had was repugnant to the due

-process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and was, more-

over, void because it abridged the privileges and immunities

of the plaintiff in error as a citizen of the United States. As

the first rests solely upon the proposition that there was a

want of due process of law, because the State was without

power to authorize a presumption of guilt on proof of the

doing of certain acts specified in the statute, it is disposed

of by what we have already said. And as the second was not

A statute imposing a succession tax is not void as against estates not closed, as denying equal protection of the laws, because it does not affect estates which had been actually closed at the time of its enactment. When the state court which has delivered two decisions declares that the later does not overrule, but distinguishes, the earlir, which it states was decided on considerations having no application to the later one, both decisions must be considered as correct interpretations of the statute construed, and it is not the province of this court to pronounce them contradictory or one to be more decisive than the other.
THE facts are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Charles Rosen and Mr. Gustave Lemle for the plaintiffs in error:
That an inheritance tax is not a tax on property, but on the privilege or right of inheriting, is no longer open to question. Magoun v. Illinois Trust & Say. Bank, 170 U. S. 283; Knowlton v. Moore, 178 U. S. 41; Plummer v. Coler, 178 U. S. 115; 27 Am. & Eng. Ency. of Law, 338.
That the rights of these heirs and legatees vested at the moment of the death of the ancestor is also beyond dispute. Black on Constitutional Prohibitions (1887), 239; Cooley,

Executors, 3 Louisiana, 336.
As to the universal legatees, the inheritance of property by them took place at the moment of their testator's death. This privilege or right of inheritance was not exercised subsequently; and, there being no inheritance after the tax was levied, no tax is due.
The prohibition .that formerly applied, under the Fifth Amendment, only to the United States, now applies with

equal force, under the Fourteenth Amendment, to the States. They, no more than the United States, can, under the guise of taxation, or other legislation, take private property for public purposes without compensation, or pass retroactive laws that divest vested rights.
This law is not merely retroactive. Remedial legislation that is retrospective is unobjectionable. Retroactive legislation that does not divest vested rights is not in violation of the Federal Constitution. But retroactive legislation that divests vested rights, that interferes with rights already acquired, that imposes a tax-for the privilege of inherison where such privilege has been long since exercised, and, therefore, requires payment of such tax merely becauseit has the physical power to do so by reason of the fact that the owner is, from some delay or other accidental cause, not yet in possession, is a clear taking of property, a clear deprivation of property, without due process of law. Cooley, Const. Lim., 6th ed., 436;' Norman v. Heist, 5 W. & S. 171;i.Beall v. Beall, 8 Georgia, 210; Case of Pell, 171 N. Y. 48; Case of Lansing, 182 N. Y. 238.
The Supreme Court of Louisiana, in holding that as the inheritance was property within the limits of the State, the State could tax it, for the purpose mentioned, until it had passed out of'the succession of the testator, erred.
Confusing the tax on the right to inherit with a tax on 'property, although the property was still within the State, the right of inheritance or succession did not still remain to
be exercised. The clause in question is a denial of the equal protection
of the laws. So far as the tax discriminates between descendants and
collaterals, there is no objection. This was expressly decided in the Magoun case, but after having first made a class of collaterals or strangers, it taxes some and exempts others-and these,too, inheriting under the same conditions, by the. same title, on the same day. This is not classification, and is a denial of the equal protection of the laws.

MR. JUSTICE MCKENNA delivered the opinion of the court.

The case involves the validity, under the Constitution of the United States, of a burden imposed inder the inheritance tax law of the State of Louisiana, passed June 28, 1904.
Mathias Levy, a resident of New Orleans, died in that city May 26, 1904. He was unmarried and left no ascendants, and was, therefore, without forced heirs. He left a last will and testament of the date of December 23, 1903, in which he named executors and made sundry particular bequests. to charitable institutions. He bequeathed the balance of his estate, in eq'ial shares, to his two nieces, Camille Cahen and

Julie Cahen, constituting them thereby his universal legatees and instituted heirs.
The will was duly probated in the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans, May 30, 1904. An inventory of his estate was taken June 9, 1904, and-a supplementary inventory August 3, 1904. The inventories showed the total appraised
value of the estate to be $64,676.05. Of this amount, after deducting the debts and charges of the estate and particular legacies, there was left, as the portion going to the universal
legatees, $42,927.94..
The final accounting and tableau of distribution was filed August 3, 1904, and approved and homologated by judgment
August 16, and the funds ordered to be distributed. October 16 a motion was made for a rule on the executors
to show cause why they should not pay over the legacies as ordered. In answer to which the executors replied that they were willing to do.so, but that it was announced to them by the president of the school board of the parish that he intended
to claim in behalf of said board a tax under the inheritance tax law of the State- on- the funds in their hands "and the' shares coming to said movers." The' executors also alleged the unconstitutionality of the tax and prayed that the school, board of the parish, through its president, AndrewH. Wilson,
be. made a party to the proceedings. Wilson appeared and averred that the taxes were due the State and not to the school board, and were collectible by the state tax collector, and "that this suit and the matters at issue herein should be litigated contradictorily with the state tax collector for the district in which the deceased resided when he departed this
life."
The tax collector appeared. The agents and attorneys in fact of the legatees answered the demand of the school board to be paid the tax that ,$10,000 of the estate was in United States,bonds, and not subject to taxation by the State, and averred that an inheritance tax was not due "to said board for the reason that said act has no application to the property

under this succession or the legacies due to said movers in the motion aforesaid; that to give it such application would be to make said act retroactive and divest the vested rights of the
said movers in said rule, which would be in violation of the constitution of this State, and especially article 166 thereof, and in violation of the Constitution of the .United States of America, and especially section 9 of article I, and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments thereof, and in violation of the laws of the State and of the land; that it would be a deprivation of property without due process of 'law and a denial of the equal proteetion of the laws, in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States of America."
Judgment was rendered'in favor of the tax collector, condemning the executors to pay the tax, less the amount of United States bonds, and less the charitable and religious bequests.. The judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State.
The law imposes a tax of three per cent "on direct inheritances and donations. to ascendants or descendants," and ten per cent upon donations or inheritances to collaterals or strangers. It is provided that the tax is "to be collected on all successions not finally closed and administered upon, and all successions hereafter opened." 1

I SECTION 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of
Louisiana; That there is now, and shall hereafter be levied, solely for the support of the public schools, a tax upon all inheritances, legacies, and donations; provided, no direct inheritance, or donation, to an ascendant or descendant, below ten thousand dollars in amount or value, shall be so taxed; a special inheritance tax, of three per cent on direct inheritances and donations to ascendants or descendants and ten per cent for collateral inheritances and donations to collaterals or strangers; provided bequests to educational, religious, or charitable institutions shall be exempt from this tax and provided further that this tax shall not be enforced when the property donated or inherited shall have borne its just proportion of taxes prior to the time of such donation or inheritance; .ihis tax to be collected on all successions not finally closed and administered upon and on all suc-

.Opinion of the Court.

It will be obgerved that when Levy died, May 26, 1904, and
when the will' was probated, May 30, 1904, there was no inheritance tax in Louisiana. The act in controversy was passed
June 28, 1904. In support of the attack made upon the law, it is contended
that an inheritance tax is not a tax on property but on the
right or privilege of inheriting, and that the right in the case at bar. had- been exercised at the moment of the testator's
death under the then existing law, and "to pass a law exacting such a tax and make it retroactive so as to divest"a right
previously acquired under then existing laws, is a deprivation of property already acquired, without due process of law, prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution
of the United States." To sustain their propositions the 1laintiffs, in error cite
certain articles of the Louisiana Civil Code.1 And it is urged.
1 ARTICLE 940. A succession is acquired by the legal heir, who is called
by law to the inheritance, immediately after the death of the deceased person whom he-succeeds.
This rule applies also to testamentary heirs, to instituted heirs and universal legatees, but not to particular legatees.
ARTICLE 941. The right mentioned in the ,preceding article is acquired
by the heir, by the operation of the law alone, before he has taken any stepto put himself in possession, or has expressed any will to accept it.
Thus,.children, idiots, those who are ignorant of the death of the deceased, are not the less considered as being seized of the succession, though they may be merely seized of right and not in fact.
ARTICLE 942. The heir being considered seized of the succession from the moment of its being opened, the right of possession, which the deceased had, continues in the person of the heir, as if there had been no interruption, and independent of the fact of possession.
ARTICLE 944. The heir being considered as having succeeded to 'the deceased from the instant of his death, the first effect of this right is that the heir transmits the succession to his own heirs, with the right of accepting or renouncing, although he himself have not accepted it, and even in case he 'was ignorant that the succession was opened in his favor.
ARTICLE 945. The second effect of this right is to authorize the heir to institute all the actions, even possessory ones, which the deceased had a right to institute, and to prosecute those already commenced. For the heir,' in everything, represents the deceased, and is of full right in his place, as well for his rights as his obligations.

as indubitable that, under the, law of Louisiana, a succession

is acquired by the legal heir immediately after the death of the deceased, and by the express terms of the code this rule applies to testamentary heirs, to instituted heirs and universal legatees. In other words, thatJthe acquisition of the succession by plaintiffs in error.was at the very moment of Levy's death, and, therefore, necessarily before the act imposing inheritance taxes was passed.- To sustain their view plaintiffs in error cite a number of cases decided prior to the decision of the case at bar, and the ease of Tulane University of Louisiana v. Board of, Assessors et al., 115 Louisiana, 1026, decided since the-,decision in the case at ,bar. Having established, as it is contended, that by operation of law the property is transmitted immediately from the.testator to the heir * it is also contended that from the very definition of an inheritance tax none could -be imposed on plaintiffs in error as legaties of Levy.
For definitions of 'an inheritance tax plaintiffs in error adduce
United States v. Perkins, 163 U. S. 625; Magoun -v. Illinois Trust & Savings Bank, 170 U. S. 283; Knowlton.v. Moore, 178 U. S. 41. The tax was defined in the Perkins case to be "not a tax upon the property itself, but 'upon its transmission by will o-r descent;" and in the Magoun case, "not one pn prop,erty, but one -on.,the succession." In Knowlton v. Moore it was said that stich taxes "rest in their essence upon the principle that death is the generating source from which the particular taxing power takes its being, and that it is the power to transmit, or the transmission from the dead to the living, on which such taxes- are more immediately rested." But these definitions were intended only to distinguish the tax from one on property, and it was not intended to be decided-that the tax must attach at the instant of the death of a testator or

ARTICLE 1609. When, at the decease of the testator, there -are no heirs. to whom a proportion of his property is reserved by law, the universal legatee, by the'death of thetestator, is seized of right of the effects of the succession, without being bound to ddmand the delivery thereof.

intestate. In other words, we defined the nature of the tax; we did not prescribe the time of its imposition. To have done
the latter would have been to prescribe a rule of succession of estates and usurp a power we did not and do not possess. There is nothing, therefore, in those cases which restrains the power of the State as to the time of the imposition of the tax. It may select the moment of death, or it may exercise its power duriig any of the time it holds the property from the legatee. "It is not," we said in the Perkins case, "until it has yielded its contribution to the State that it becomes the property of the legatee." See also Carpenter et al. v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 17 How. 456.
We must turn back, therefore, to the law of Louisiana for the solution of the questions presented in the case at bar. But we are not required to reconcile the Louisiana decisions. We accept that in the case at bar as a correct interpretation
of the code of the State. Nor may we regard Tulane University v. Board of Assessors, as irreconcilable with it. That case was brought to enjoin the collection of state and city taxes which had been assessed against the succession of A. C. Hutchinson. The plaintiff university Was the universal legatee of Hutchinson, and its property was exempt from taxation under the constitution of the State. It is true the court said that the code of the -State "left no room for doubt or surmise as to the fact of the property of a deceased person being transmitted directly and immediately to the legal heir, or, in the absence of forced heirs, to the universal legatee, without any intermediate stage, when it would be vested in the successive representative or in the legal abstract, called 'suc-
cession.' But the decision in the case at bar was not overruled, but
distinguished-as follows: "The case of succession of Levy was decided from considerations peculiar to an inheritance tax,
and which can have no application to the instant case. This inheritance tax was held to be due notwithstanding that, under the provisions of the code, the ownership of the prop-

erty passed to the heirs. The maxim," Le mort saisit le vif,' _,as expressly recognized." Both decisions, therefore, must :beUcohsidered as correct interpretations of the code of the State. It is not our province to pronounce one more decisive than the other, or to prvnounce a contradiction between them, which the court which delivired ,both of them has declared does not exist. We must assume that the Tulane case approved*th' view expressed in the case at: bar of the rights of legatees, as follows: "Furthermore, we have said, the legatees acquired no vested right to the property bequeathed which could enable them to successfully defend their inheritance against the demand of the State for the inheritance tax. It was property within the limits of the State, which the State
could tax, for purposes mentioned, until it had pasped out of the succession of the testator."
Plaintiffs in error also. contended that the statute denied them the equal protection of the laws. This contention is based on the following 'provision of the statute: "This tax to be collected on all successions not finaily closed and administered upon, and on all successions hereafter opened."
Successions which have been closed, it is said, are exempt from the tax, and a discrimination is made: between'heirs whose rights have become fixed and vested on the same day. Counsel say: "The closing of the succession cannot affect the question as to when the rights of the heirs vested; and cannot be a cause for differentiation among the heiU; and such A classification is purely arbitrary. Besides, such a classification rests on the theory that'the tax-is one on property, when in fact it is one on. the right of inheritance." But, as we understand, the Supreme Court made the validity of the tax
depend upon the very fact. which icounsel: attack as an improper basis of, classification... The -court decided, that the property bequeathed was ,property the State could tax, "until. it had passed out of the succession of the testator."

ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS.
No. 103. Argued- November 14. 1906.-Decided December 24, 1906.
The fact that, as construed by the highest court of that State, the exemptions in the inheritance tax law of Illinois of religious and educational institutions do not apply to corporations of other States, does not render the provisions of the law applicable to foreign religious and educational institutions void as discriminatory and counter to the equal protection clause- of the Fourteenth Amendment.
It is not an unreasonable or arbitrary classification for a State to exempt from inheritance taxes only such property bequeathed for charity or educational purposes as shall be bestowed within its borders or exercised by'persons or corporations under its control.
THE facts are stated in the opinion.

TRAVERS v. REINHARDT.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS' OF THE DISTRICT OF
COLUMBIA.
No. 76. _ Aued November 1, 2, 1906.-Decided April 15, 1907.
While the predominant idea of the testator's mind when discovered is to be heeded as against all doubtful and conflicting provisions which might defeat it, effect must be given to all the words of a will if by the rules of law it can be done; and the words "without leaving a wife or child or children" will not be construed as "without leaving a wife and child or children," notwithstanding a general dominant interest on the part' of the testator that his real estate should descend only through his sons.
A man and woman', neither of whom was a resident of Virginia, and who had not obtained any marriage license, went through a ceremony in Virginia which the woman thought was a marriage by a clergyman; they immediately went to New Jersey, she assuming the man's name; they afterwards went to Maryland and then returned to New Jersey permanently, where they lived and cohabitated as husband and wife and were so regarded for many years until his death, she joining in a mortgage with hin, and also being described in his wills-as his wife; she meanwhile and, prior to the later residence in New Jersey, had ascertained that the person performing the ceremony was not a minister and that there was no license, but the cohabitation continued and there was testimony that the man assured her that they were married, and afterwards in his last will he appointed his wife executrix and she qualified assuch; Held, that:
'Marriage in fact, as distinguished from a ceremonial marriage, may be proved by habit and repute, and, except in cases of adultery and bigamy when actual proof is required, may be inferred from continued cohabits-

tion and reputation; and even though in view. of the statutory requirements in those States the marriage might have been invalid in Virginia for want of license, and in Maryland for want'of religious ceremony, the cohabitation in good faith and reputation during their residence in New Jersey, and their conduct towards each other from the time of the ceremony until the man's death., established an agreement between the pa ties' per verba de prwsenti,to become husband and wife which was as effective to establish that status in New Jersey as if made in words of the present tense after the parties had become domiciled in that State. 25 App. D. C. 567, affirmed.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Bernard Carter and Mr. Arthur A. Birney, with whom Mr. Charles.H.Stanley, Mr. Edward A. Newman and Mr. Fillmore BeaU were on the brief, for appellants:
.The testator devised all his real estate, except a small portion theteof, to his four sons. By a codicil he revoked the devise to his daughter Elizabeth and gave that parcel to one of his sons.
In making the devises to his son Elias and a portion to his son Joseph, he made them to such son, "his heirs and assigns forever in fee simple. ' The other devises are to his several sons, "their heirs and assigns forever," without the addition of the words "in fee simple." No devises are in terms of a less estate. That the testator deliberately nyde the distinction in the terms of these two classes of devises is shown by the "general provision," of the will, to the effect of which he subjects each of the devises of the second class.
The language of the devises was, without more, ample to create a fee simple. Qualified by the general provision, each of the devises affected thereby became a determinable fee in the first taker, with an executory -devise over to the surviving sons and the child or children of such as might be dead. Abbott v. Essex Company, 18 How. 202; Richardson v. Noyes, 2 Massachusetts, 56; Underhill on Wills, 1272, 1274.
It is a rule in construing wills that where a general intent is apparent upon the face of the will, and a particular intent is also expressed whic conflicts with such general intent, the

latter will prevail. 2 Williams on Executors (7th Am. ed.), 333;
Chase v. Lockerman, 11 G. & J. 286; Thompson v. Young, 25 Maryland, 459; Taylor v. Watson, 35 Maryland, 524; Smith v. Bell, 6 Pet. 68; In re Banks' Will, 87 Maryland, 425.
The construction of the will is to be made from the entire
instrument, including the codicil, and the intent of the testator thus ascertained be permitted to govern. Jones v. Wright, 2 Bligh, 49; White v. Crenshaw, 5 Mackey, 115.
Where two clauses in a will operate on the same property, devising it differently, giving it to different devisees, or showing
a different technical intention, the latter clause will prevail. Dugan v. Hollins, 13 Maryland, 149; Manning v. Thurston, 59 Maryland, 226.
The general intent of the testator being to keep his real estate within the male line of descent, to the exclusion of the female, is it to be supposed that he was willing that this intent should be defeated by the mere marriage of a son? He might be willing to measurably provide for a widow, through an allowance equal to dower, but the existence of the widow affords no reason for letting in the daughters to heir.
Courts will change or mold language so as to give effect to the intention. Schouler on Wills, 3d ed., § 477; Jarman on Wills, 505, 507; Doe v. Watson, 8 How. 263, 272; Hance v. Noble, 172 U. S. 383, 389; Hardenberghv. Ray, 151 U. S. 126; Shugloff v. Johns, 87 Maryland, 273; Scarlett v. Montell, 95 Maryland, 157.
The words "wife or child or children" should be read wife
and child or children. The cases cited and many others -justify such change.
If the will be construed as we contend, the proceeds of the devises to James, affected by the general provision, must be awarded to the appellants, for it will not be claimed that he left a child surviving him; if, however, this point be ruled :against the appellants, they must yet succeed, unless it has been shown, either, first, that James Travers married and his wife survived him; or, second, that he and his brother Elias

(the last survivor of the brothers) entered into a binding agreement with their sisters that they should share as heirs in the property thus devised to James. No such marriage was proved, and the alleged agreement or estoppel was not established.
The testimony of the woman, Sophia V. O'Brien, should have been rejected as wholly unworthy of belief, and with this out of the case there would not have Jeen the slightest evidence that James Travers was ever married, except the recitals of his mutilated will of 1881, of his will .of 1883, and of the mortgage deed of September 27, 1867.
The mortgage, and the will of 1881, were both made ,in Maryland, where the "common law marriage," so called, is unknown, and a ceremony in facice ecclesie is necessary to a valid union. Denison v. Denison, 35 Maryland, 297.
The will of 1883 seems to have been made in New Jersey, where a looser rule prevails, but where a contract to marry is as important as it is in Maryland.
The Court of Appeals had no basis in the evidence for the assertion in its opinion that during the whole time he called her and introduced her as his wife, and she was so recognized .in the. conmmunity generally.
The only witness sworn was the woman. She certainly could not establish her own repute as married. She said nothing whatever of her life at Point Pleasant, before the death of Travers, and, of her, life elsewhere, said only, that Travers introduced her as his wife, and that she was called "Mrs. Travers." This-falls far short of proving that" public recognition," which this court has declared "necessary as evidence of its existence," in the-case of the marriage without ceremony or record. Maryland v. Baldwin, 112 U. S.490, 495; Commonwealth v. Stump, 53 Pa. St. 132 (cited 112 U. S. 495); Jones v. Hunter, 2 La. Ann. 224; Taylor v. Swett, 22 Am. Dec. 159, note.
This case, then, must turn upon the question whether there was a valid marriage between James Travers and Sophia Grayson at Alexandria, Virginia, on August .15, 1865.

TRAVERS v. REINHARDT.

205 U. S.

Argument for Appellees.

The Virginia statute required that in all cases a license should issue and without it there could be no valid marriage. The emphatic decision of the Court of Appeals of Virginia, delivered in 1901, would foreclose discussion on this subject were it not for the ground taken by Mr. Justice Gould, in sustaining as a marriage the union under discussion. "Offield v. Davis, 100 Virginia, 250; Beverlin v. Beverlin, 29 W. Va. 732.
The Virginia decision is conclusive that without a license there could be no marriage in that State. Leffingwell v. Warren, 2 Black, 599, 603; Green v. Lessee of Neal, 6 Pet. 291; Bauserman v. Blunt, 147 U. S. 652; Meister v. Moore, 96 U. S. 82; Fairfieldv. County of Gallatin, 100 U. S. 47, 52.

Mr. William A. Gordon, Mr. George E. Hamilton and Mr. M. J. Colbert, with whom Mr. J. Holdsworth Gordon was on the brief, for appellees:
While the marriage in Virginia in 1865 did not 'comply with the statute of that State, under Offield v. Davis, 100 Virginia, 250, and would have been void as to the status of the parties in that State and as to property there located, as the parties immediately left that State and never returned there, but subsequently resided in New Jersey and Maryland, and as the property in controversy is located in the District of Columbia, the status of Sophia as the wife of James Travers at the time of his decease does not depend upon the law in Virginia.
It has never been held that the law in the District of Columbia denied validity to marriages good at common law, and in fact the only dicta on the subject lean toward the validity of such marriages, even when, contracted in said District. Thom as v. Holtzman, 18 App. D. C. 66.
The fact that letters testamentary were granted .to her by the New Jersey court as the widow of James Travers, although her name was not given in the will, is conclusive proof of the reputation of marriage in that community; hnd the fact that his next of kin and heirs-at-law permitted her as "wif&"

to qualify as executrix and take under the devise to his "wife" shows conclusively that she was recognized by them as the wife of their brother.
The bequest in the will of his sister Elizabeth, a nun in the convent at Georgetown, to Annie E. Travers, the reputed child of James, as her "niece" should be received as evidence of reputation, so far as that sister is concerned, as to the marriage, and that James and Sophia V. Travers were man
and wife. These acts certainly constituted a marriage under the laws
of New Jersey, and if a lawful marriage in that State it will be recognized as such in the District of Columbia.
Atlantic City R. R. Co. v. Gooding, 62 N. J. 394, it was held that a contract of marriage made per verba de prwsenti constitutes an actual marriage and is valid, and in Stevens v. Stevens, 56 N. J. Eq. 490, that a common law marriage is good. Even though the marriage in Virginia did not constitute a lawful marriage in that State, it did constitute an agreoment between the parties to accept each other as man and wife, thus constituting a marriage good at common law, and their stay in New Jersey immediately after said common law marriage, and especially the residence in that State in 1883, prior to the death of James Travers, and their living there in compliance with the terms of the contract entered into in Virginia, made their status that of man and wife. Meister v. Moore, 96 U. S. 76; Meyer v. Pope, 110 Massachusetts, 314; Smith v. Smith, 52 N. J. 207.
The decision in Offield v. Daiais, rendered in 1902, is not conclusive on this court, as in 1877 it decided, in Meister v. Moore, supra,in construing a-statute in many respects identical with the Virginia statute, that a marriage similar to. that now
under consideration was valid.

MR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the court.

This suit was originally brought for the partition or sale of

certain real estate in the city of Washington devised by the will (and codicils thereto) of Nicholas Travers who died in the year 1849, leaving four sons and three daughters.
The only parts of that estate remaining in.dispute are certain lots in square 291 in Washington, and the questions to be determined depend upon the construction of. that will and upon the evidence touching the alleged marriage of James Travers, a son of the testator, with Sophia V. Grayson.
By the first item of the will certain lots are devised to the testator's son Elias "and his heirs and assigns forever in fee simple." By the same item other lotg are devised to the same son, ."which last two levises shall be subject to the general provision hereinafter made in case of any sons dying without leaving a wife or child or children."
By the second item the testator devised lot 5, in square 291, to his son "Joseph Travers and his heirs forever," and two other. specified lots "to him and his. heirs forever, in. fee simple;" lot 5 "being subject to the general provision aforesaid hereafter.
made." By the third-item he devised to his son Nicholas and his heirs
forever certain lots in square 291 "bubject to the general provision hereinafter made;" also "to him and his heirs forever, in fee simple," other real estate in square 36, and a designated parcel of ground in square 291, "said piece or parcel of ground to be subject to the general provision hereafter made."
By the fourth item certain devises are made to the son. "James Travers and his heirs forever," "all of which devises are to be subject to thegeneral provision hereinafter made."
Here follows, at the close of'the fourth item, the "general provision" referred to: "With regard to the several estates hereinbefore devised'to my several sons, it is hereby declared to be my will, and I do order and direct, as a general provision, that if any of my sons should. die without leaving d'wife, or a child or children living at his death, then his estate herein devised to him, saving and excepting those portions thereof expressly granted and so named to be ii fee simple,' and which they

can sell and dispose of as they think fit, shall go, and be invested in fee, to my surviving sons and the child or children of such as may be dead, such child or children representing the share of the father-but if either of my sons shall, at his death, leave a wife either with or without a child or children, such wife shall be entitled to her dower rights and privileges."
This was followed in the will by certain devises for the benefit of the daughters, as well as by several codicils to the will, but it is not necessary to give their provisions in detail.
By a codicil, dated June 26th, 1848, the testator revoked certain parts of his will, providing: "And in lieu thereof I do hereby give and devise all of said lots or part 0f lots, so as aforesaid described, with the house and other improvements and appurtenances, to my son James and his heirs, subject to the express stipulations and restrictions contained in the will to which this is a codicil, wherein I declare that all and every sportion of my real estate not devised by the use of the words 'in fee simple,' shall be held by such Idevisees for'life, and then according to stipulations and restrictions as therein contained and declared by said will."
It is contended here, ,as it was in the courts below, that the words in the above general provision, that "if any of my sons should die without leaving a wife or child or children living at his death," should be interpreted as if it read -"if any of my sons shouild die without leaving a wife and child or children living 't his death." The court is thus asked,, by interpretation, to substitute the word "and" in place of "or" in the above sentence.
Looking at all the provisions of the will, and ascertaining, as best we may, the intention of the testator, we perceive no reason for interpreting the words used by him otherwise than according to their ordinary, natural meaning.
It is insisted by appellants that the general, dominant purpose of the testator was that his real estate should descend only through his sons, and that his daughters and their descendants should have no share therein. And the doctrine is in-

voked that "the predominant idea of a testator's mind, when discovered, is to be heeded as against all doubtful and' conflicting provisions .which might of themselves defeat it; and the general intent and particular intent being inconsistent, the latter .(the particular) must be sacrificed to the former-the general intent." Schouler on Wills, § 476. This general doc,trine is not controverted, but there are other cardinal rules in the interpretation, of wills which must be regarded. Mr. Jus-
tice Story, speaking for this court, said that effect must be given "to all the words of a will, if, by the rules of law, it can be done. And where words occur in a will their plain andordinary sense is to be attached to them, unless the testator manifestly applies them in some other sense." Wright v. Denn, 10 Wheat. 204, 239. "The first and great rule in the exposition of wills," said. Chief Justice Marshall, "to which all other rules must bend, is that the intention of the testator expressed in his will shall prevail, provided it be consistent with the rules of law." Smith v. Bell, 6 Pet. 68, 75; Finlayv. King, 3 Pet. 346, 377. The same thought, in substance, was expressed by Lord Chancellor Eldon in Crooke v. De Vendes, 9 Ves. 197, 205. . He said that "where words have once got a clear, settled, legal meaning, it is very dangerous to cotijecture against that, upon no better foundation than simply that it is improbable, the testator could have meant to do one thing by one set of words, having done another thing, using bther words, as to persons in the same degree of relation to him." It would seem clear that the words "withofit leaving a wife or
child or children," where they first appear in the above general provision, were purposely chosen. They appear three times in the will, and their usual meaning is not doubtful. We think the testator meant "or," not "and." The court would not be justified in making the proposed substitution unless the whole context of the will plainly and beyond question requires that ,to be done in order to give effect to the will of the testator. That the words, in the generai provision, "without leaving a wife or a child or children," were deliberately selected is to

205 U. S.

some extent shown by the last sentence in the first item of the will, "which two devises shall be subject to the general pro-
vision hereinafter made in case of any sons dying without leaving a wife or child or children." We do not think that the testator used the word "or," intending thereby to convey the same thought as would be expressed by "and." We concur with the Court of Appeals, speaking by Chief Justice Shepatd, in holding that the words in question are unambiguous, and
their obvious, ordinary meaning must-not be defeated by conjecture. 25 App. D. C. 567, 576.
The important question remains whether James Travers,
the son of the testator, died leaving a wife or a child or children. If he did, then the decree below must be affirmed.
The original bill averred that James Travers died in 1883 "without widow or lawful child or children or descendants of a
child or children surviving him." This averment was not specifically denied in the answers, but in the progress of the cause the defendants, 'children of the sisters of James Travers, amended their answer and alleged that he left surviving him "his widow, Sophia V. Travers, now Sophia V. O'Brien, who was his lawful wife at the time of his death and who had been his lawful wife for many years prior thereto, and he left one child, Annie E. Travers, one of the defendants herein, who was his lawful child." The issue thus made constituted the princi-
pal matfer to which the proof was directed. Both of the courts below held that under the evidence Sophia V. was to be deemed the lawful. wife of James Travers at the time of his death. Children were born to them, but they died very young. It is conceded that they left .no child surviving them, Annie E. Travers being only an adopted child.
The appellants insisted throughout the case and now insist that the relation between James Travers and Sophia V. was not at any time one of a matrimonial cohabitation, but an illicit or meretricious cohabitation, which did not create the
relation of husband and wife. Upon a careful scrutiny of all the evidence as to the alleged

TRAVERS v. REINHARDT.

205 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

marriage we think that the fbllowing facts may be regarded
as established: 1. James Travers, whose domicil was in the District of
Columbia, and Sophia V. Grayson, whose domicil was in West Virginia, were in Alexandria together on the fifteenth of' August, 1865, when some sort of marriage ceremony (exactly what does not appear) was performed by a 'friend of Travers, whom the woman, then only about seventeen years of age,
and without living parents, supposed at the time was a minister, entitled to officiate in that capacity at a marriage. She thought it was a real marriage by a minister, although he did not produce or have any license to solemnize the marriage of these parties. It must be taken upon the evidence that he was not a minister. By the statutes of Virginia then in force it was provided: "Every marriage in this State shall be under a license and solemnized in the manner herein provided, but no marriage -solemnized by any persons professing to be 'authorized to solemnize the same shall be deeme%. or adjudged to be void, nor shall the validity thereof be in any way affected on account of any want of authority in such persons if the marriage be in all other respects lawful and be consummated with a full belief on the part of the persons so married, or either of them, that they have been lawfully joined in marriage."
2. Immediately after the affair 'at Alexandria the parties-the woman, from and after that occasion, assuming the name of Mrs. Travers-left Virginia and went to Shrewsbury, New Jersey, where, as husband and wife, they remained for a short time, after which they went to, Belair, Harford County, Maryland, living there, as husband and wife, at a rented place.
3. In 1867 Travers purchased a farm in Talbot County, Maryland, on which he lived with said Sophia until some time in 1883, when that farm was sold, and, on account of Travers' health, they removed to Point Pleasant, New Jbrsey, and purchased property there, having lived on the Talbot County farm, as husband and wife, for more than fifteen years. Travers died at Point Pleasant in the lat-ter part of the year 1883, and

five years after his death the woman, claiming to be and

recognized in the community as the widow of James Travers.

married a lawyer of Philadelphia, the ceremony being per-

formed at the Catholic Church in Point Pleasant.

.4. From the. fifteenth of August, 1865, up to his death, on

the first day of November, 1883-a period of more than

eighteen years-Travers and Mrs. Travers continuously co-

habited as husband and wife. During all that period they

acted as if they were lawfully husband and wife, and uniformly

held themselves out as sustaining that relation; and beyond all

question they were regarded as husband and wife in the several

communities in which they lived after leaving Alexandria in

1865. There is no proof that any one coming in contact with

them regarded them otherwise.

5. About five or six years after the latter date Mrs. Travers

learned, for the first time, that Travers' "friend" who had

officiated at the ceremony in Alexandria was not a minister.

She was asked, when giving her deposition, this question:

"Q. After you discovered, some four or five years after you

went to live with Mr. Travers, that you had not been married

to him according to any ceremony, did he ever make any

promise to you in that regard? A. Always. Poor fellow, he

would have it all right-

Mr. Birney: We object to that.

Q. And what did he say? A. Well, he would always say that it

was all right, and we were just as much married as if we had

been married before a priest or a minister." Upon the basis

of their being husband and .wife the parties continuously rested

their relations to each other up to the death of Travers.

6. That Travers recognized Mrs. Travers as his wife, and held her out as such, appears from many facts: (a) In a mort-

gage executed- September 27th, 1867, to secure the balance of

the purchase money due on the Talbot County farm, the mort-

gagors are described, both in the body of the mortgage as

"James Travers and Sophia V. Travers, his wife, of Harford

County, in the 'State of Maryland," and in the certificate of

acknowledgment as "James Travers and Sophia V. Travers,

Opinion 6f the Court.

his wife," and she signed and acknowledged the mortgage as
Sophia V. Travers. (b) By a-mutilated, holographic will dated February 8th, 1881, and signed by James Travers, he gave, devised and bequeathed "to my wife Sophy Virginia Travers," all his household furniture, books, pictures, etc., to have and to hold the same to her, and her executors, administrators and assigns forever; also, to her the use,. improvement and income of his dwelling house and farm, "to have and to hold the same to her for and during her natural life; and from and after the decease of my said wife, I give and bequeath," etc.; and by which, further, he gave, devised and bequeathed "to my wife Sophy Virginia Travers, for her sole use," all the rest and residue of the testator's estate, real, personal or mixed, of which he died seized and possessed, or to which he should be entitled at the time of his decease. That will concluded: "Lastly, I do nominate.apd appoint my said wife sole executrix
of this my last will-'and testament." (c) By a will dated at Point Pleasant, New Jersey, October 5th, 1883, witnessed by three persons, James Travers devised to his brothers and sisters all his interest and property in the District of Columbia, and "to my wife, while she remains my widow, all my property of
every description and character not hereinbefore disposed of with full power of disposition and alienation, provided, however, that in case our daughter survives her, that all the property not disposed of prior to. my wife's decease shall be and become the pioperty of our said daughter, and in the event of my wife's contracting another marriage, then, it is my will that she shall possess and, enjoy as of her own right, only onethird of the property then remaining, and that the other twothirds shall be invested and held in trust for my daughter Annie, and paid to her upon attaining her majority. . .. I hereby appoint my wife Sole Executrix of this my last will and testament." 'That will was duly proven before the Surrogate of Ocean County, New Jersey, jphrtly by Mrs. Travers, and that officer certified that "Sophia Virginia Travers of the county of Ocean, the executrix therein named, proved the

205 U. S.

same before me and she is duly authorized to take upon herself the administration of the estate of the testator agreeably to said will." That will was duly filed and recorded in the proper office in the District of Columbia.
In view of these facts, the question is whether the woman Sophia was to be deemed the lawful wife of James Travers at the time of his death in 1883. Marriage in fact, as distinguished from a ceremonial marriage, may be proven in various ways. Of course the best evidence of the exchange of marriage consent between the parties would come from those who were personally present when they mutually agreed to take each other as husband and wife, and to assume all the responsibilities of that relation. But a legal marriage may be established in other ways. It may be shown by what is called habit or repute. Referring to marriage at common law, Kent says: "The consent of the parties may be declared before a magistrate, or simply before witnesses, or subsequently confessed or acknowledged, or the marriage may even be. inferred from continual cohabitation and reputation as husband and wife, except in cases of civil actions for adultery, or in public prosecutions for bigamy or adultery, when actual proof of the marriage is required." 2 Kent, 12th ed., 88.
Naturally, the first inquiry must have reference to what
occurred at Alexandria, Virginia, in 1865, when, as the woman supposed-in good faith, we think-that there was a real, valid marriage between her and James Travers. But we will assume for the purposes of this case only that that marriage was not a valid one under the laws of Virginia. We do this in deference
to the decision of the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia in Offield v. Davis, 100 Virginia, 250, 263, in which that court, construing the above statute of that Commonwealth, held it to be mandatory, not directory, and had abrogated the common law in force in Virginia, and that no marriage or attempted marriage, if it took place there, would be held valid there, unless it be shown to have been under a license, and solemnized according to the statute of that Commonwealth. We will also

TRAVERS v. REINHARDT.

205 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

assume, but only for the purposes of the present decision, tnd because of the earnest contentions of the plaintiffs in error, that cohabitation in Maryland, as husband and wife, for more than fifteen years, and the recognition of that relation in the communities where they resided in that State, did not entitle James Travers and the woman Sophia to be regarded in that State as lawfully husband and wife. We make this assump.tion also because it appears here that James Travers and Sophia V. Grayson did not become husband and wife in virtue of any religious ceremony, and because it has been decided by the Court of Appeals of Maryland that in that State "there cannot be a valid marriage without a religious ceremony," although "a marriage may be competently proved without the testimony of witnesses who were present at the ceremony." Richardsonv. Smith, 80 Maryland, 89, 93. That court also said in the same case: "The law has wisely provided that marriage may be proved by general reputation, cohabitation and acknowledgment; when these exist, it will be inferred that a religious ceremony has taken place; and this proof will not be invalidated because evidence cannot be obtained of the time, place and manner of the celebration of the marriage. On this point we think it unnecessary to do more than quote from Redgrave v. Redgrave, 38 Maryland, 93, 97: 'Where parties live together ostensibly as man and wife, demeaning themselves towards each other as such, and are received into society and treated by their friends and relations as having and being entitled to that status, the law will, in favor of morality and decency, presume that they have been legally married. 1 Taylor, Evidence, §§ 140, 517; Hervey v. Hervey, 2 W. B1. 877; Goodman v. Goodman, 28 L. J. Ch. 1; Jewell v. Jewell, 1 How. 219, 232. Indeed, the most usual way of proving marriage, except in actions for criminal conversation and in prosecutions for bigamy, is by general reputation, cohabitation and acknowledgment. Sellman v. Bowen, 8 Gill & John. 50; Boone v. Purnell, 28 Maryland, 607.' " We may refer, in this connection, to what the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia,

speaking by Judge Merrick, who was learned in the law of Maryland, said in Thomas v. Holtzman, 18 D. C. 62, 66: "In the first place, it is not at all apparent that it ever was the law that a marriage in facie de ecclesixs was necessary for the purpose of legitimating the issue. It is true that the Court of Appeals of Maryland in the last four or five years has decided that such was the law, but that decision is not binding upon us. It is laid down by Blackstone that a marriage per verba de prcesenti without the intervention of a clergyman is a legitimate marriage. And both Story and Kent say that according to the universal understanding in this country a marriage per verba de prxsenti, without the intervention of a clergyman, followed by cohabitation, makes a legitimate marriage."
In Voorhees v. Voorhees, 1 Dick. Ch. 411, 413, 414, the Court of Chancery of New Jersey said: "Two essentials of a valid' marriage are capacity and consent. . . Marriage is a civil contract, and no ceremonial is indispensably requisite to its creation. A contract of marriage made per verba de prcesenti amounts to an actual marriage and is valid," quoting O'Gara v. Eisenlohr,38 N. Y. 296. In Atlantic City y4 Gordin,62 N. J. 394, 400, the New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals said: "In the Voorhees case Vice Chancellor Van Fleet concedes that a contract of marriage made per verba de proesenti amounts to an actual marriage and is valid, and in the case of Stevens v. Stevens, 11 Dick. Ch. Rep. 488, Vice Chancellor Pitney declares the law on the subject to the same effect, citing abundant authority."
This brings us to consider what were the relations of these parties after selling the Maryland farm and after taking up their residence in New Jersey in 1883. That their cohabitation, as husband and wife, after 1865 and while they lived in Maryland, continued without change after they became domiciled in New Jersey and up to the death of James Travers; and that they held themselves out in New Jersey as lawfully husband and wife, and recognized themselves and were recognized in the community as sustaining that relation, is manifest from

Opinion 6f the Court.

all the evidence and circumstanceS. It is impossible to explain, their conduct towards each other while living in New Jersey upon any other theory than that they regarded each other as legally holding the matrimonial relation of husband and wife.
It is true that no witness proves express words signifying an actual agreement or .contract between the parties to live together as husband and wife. No witness heard them say, in words, in the presence of each other, "We have agreed to take each other as husband and wife, and live together as such," But their conduct towards each other, from the time they left
Alexandria in 1865. up to the death of James Travers in 1883, admits of no other interpretation than that they had agreed, from the outset, to be husband and wife. And that agreement, so far as this record shows, was faithfully kept up to the death of James Travers. When it is remembered that James Travers assured the woman Sophia that they were as much married as if they had been married by a priest or minister; that in his mortgage of 1867 she is described as his wife; that in th&holographic will of 1881 he recognized her as his wife; that in his last will, made at his domicil in New Jersey, he referred to her as his wife, and devised by that will property to her while she remained his widow and did not contract another marriage; and that he made her the sole executrix of his -will, describing her.
as his wife; when these facts are supplemented by the fact that they lived together, without intermission, in good faith, and openly, for more than eighteen years as husband and wife, nothing more. is needed to show that he and the Woman had mutually agreed to sustain the relation of husband and wife. Under the evidence in the cause they are to be held as having prior to the death of James Travers, agreed per verba de prcesenti to become husband and wife.
Did the law of New Jersey recognize them as husband and wife after they took up their residence in that State and lived together, in good faith, as husband and wife and were there recognized as such? Upon the authorities cited this question must be answered in the affirmative.

OCTOBER TERM, 1906.

Opinion of the Court.

205 U. S.

We are of opinion that even if the alleged marriage would have been regarded as invalid in Virginia for want of license, had the parties remained there, and invalid in Maryland for want of a religious ceremony, had they remained in that State, it was to be deemed a valid marriage in New Jersey after James Travers and the woman Sophia, as husband and wife, took up their permanent residence there and lived together in that relation, continuously, in good faith, and openly, up to the death of Travers-being regarded by themselves and in the community as husband and wife. Their conduct towards each other in the eye of the public, while in New Jersey, taken in connection with their previous association, was equivalent, in law, to a declaration by each that they did and during their joint lives were to occupy the relation of husband and wife. Such a declaration was as effective to establish the status of marriage in New Jersey as if it had been made in words of the present tense after they became domiciled in that State.
The views we have expressed find support in the authorities. In Meister v. Moore, 96 U. S. 76, 79, it was said that an informal marriage by contract per verba de pr&,senti constituted a marriage at common law, and that a statute simply requiring "all marriages to be entered into in the presence of a magistrate or clergyman, or that it be preceded by a license, or publication of banns, or be attested by witnesses," may be construed "as merely directory, instead of being treated as destructive of a common law right to form the marriage relation by words of present assent."
In Maryland v. Baldwin, 112 U. S. 490, 494, 495, the court said: "It is proper to say that, by the law of Pennsylvania, where, if at all, the parties were married, a marriage is a civil contract, and may be made per verba de presenti, that is, by words in the present 'tense, without attending ceremonies, religious or civil. Such is also the law of -many other States in the absence of statutory regulation. It is the doctrine of'the common law. But where no such ceremonies are required, and no record is made to attest the marriage, some public recogni-

tion of it is necessary as evidence of its existence. The protection of the parties and their children and considerations of public policy require this public recognition; and it may be made in any way which can be seen and known by men, sucl as living together as man and wife, treating each other and speaking of each other in the presence of third parties as bcing in that relation, and declaring the relation in documents executed by them whilst living together, such as deeds, wills, and other formal instruments."
So in Hoggan v. Craigie, Mac. & Rob. 942, 965, in which Lord Chancellor Cranworth, referring to contracts of marriage per verba de prcesenti, said: "It is not necessary to prove the contract itself; it is sufficient if the facts of the case are such as to lead to satisfactory evidence of such a contract having taken place; upon this principle the acknbwledgment of the parties, their conduct towards each other, and the repute consequent upon it, may be sufficient to prove a marriage. . . . Everything, therefore, is pertinent and relevant in an inquiry like the present, which indicates the present or previous consent of the parties." Again, in Campbell v. Campbell, known as the Breadalbane Case, L. R. 1 Sc. App. 182, 192, 196, 211, Lord Chancellor Chelmsford said: "Habit and repute arise from parties cohabiting together openly and constantly, as if. they were husband and wife, and so conducting themselves towards each other for such a length of time in the society or neighborhood of which they are members as to produce a general belief that they are really married." In the same case Lord Westbury, after observing that it might not be strictly correct to speak of cohabitation with habit and repute as a mode of contracting marriage, said: "It is rather a mode of making manifest to the world that tacit consent which the law will infer to have been already interchanged. If I were to express what I collect from the different opinions on the subject I should rather. be inclined to express the rule in the following language: that cohabitation as husband and wife is amanifestation of the parties having consented to contract the relationship inter se.

OCTOBER, TERM 1906.

HOLMES, J., dissenting.

205 U. S.

It is a holding forth to the world by the manner of daily life

by conduct, demeanor, and habit, that the man and woman

who live together have agreed to take each other in marriage

and to stand in the mutual relation of husband and wife; and

when credit is given by those among whom they live, by their

relatives, neighbors, friends, and acquaintances, to these rep-

resentation and this continued conduct, then habit and repute

arise and attend upon the cohabitation. The parties are holden

and reputed to be husband and wife; and the law of Scotland

accepts this combination of circumstances as evidence that

consent to marry has been lawfully interchanged." In his

Treatise on Domestic Relations, Eversley says: "Marriage may

also be proved between the parties by their conduct towards

each other, and the first consent need not be proved; 'it is suffi-

cient if the facts of the case are such as to lead to satisfactory

evidence of such a contract having taken place; the acknowledg-

ment of the parties, their conduct toward each other, and the

repute consequent upon it, may be sufficient to prove a mar-

riage'" p. 41. See also 2 Greenleaf on Evidence (Harriman's

ed.), §§ 461, 462, and notes; 3 Wigmore on Evidence, §§ 2082,

2083, and authorities cited.

Without further discussion or citation of authorities, we

adjudge that the courts below did not err in holding that, under

the evidence, James Travers and the Mrs. Travers who lived

with him constantly and openly as his wife for more than

eighteen years, were_ iff law, to be deemed husband and wife

at the time of his death, in New Jersey, in 1883. It results

from this view that the decree of the Court of Appeals, affirm-

ing the decree of the Supreme Court of the District, must itself

be affirmed.

It is so ordered.

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES, dissenting.

I feel some doubts in this case which I think that I ought

to state. I understand it to be assumed, as it must be admitted, that James Travers and Sophia V. Grayson lived together for many years, calling themselves man and wife, when they were not man and wife and probably knew that they were not man and wife. This condition of things lasted from 1865, the time of the pretended marriage in Virginia to which their cohabitation referred for its justification, until 1883, the . year of James Travers' death. So long as they lived in Maryland, that is until some time in 1883, if they had attempted to make -their union more legitimate by simply mutual agreement they could not have done it. Therefore the instances of James Travers calling Sophia his wife during that period may be laid on one side.
Just before he died Travers moved to New Jersey and there made his will. As in Maryland, he spoke of his wife in that instrument, and as I understand it, the decision that he was married must rest wholly on this recognition and the fact that in New Jersey a marriage may be made without the intervention of a magistrate. I do not see how these facts can be enough. Habit and repute might be evidence of a marriage when unexplained. But they must be evidence of a contract, however informal, to have any effect. When an appellation shown to have been used for nearly eighteen years with conscious want of justification continues to be used for the last month of lifetime, I do not see how the fact that the parties have crossed a state line can make that last month's use evidence that in that last moment the parties made a contract which then for the first time they could have made in this way.
It is imperative that a contract should have been made in
New Jersey. Therefore even if both parties had supposed that they were married instead of knowing the contrary it would not have mattered. To live in New Jer.-ey and think you are married does not constitute a marriage by the law of ,that State. If there were nothing else in the case it might be evidence of marriage, but on these facts the belief, if it was entertained, 'referred to the original inadequate ground.

Collins v. Voorhees, 47 N. J. Eq. 555. A void contract is not made over again or validlited by being acted upon at a time when a valid contract could be made. When a void contract is acted upon, the remedy, when there is one, is not on the contract, but upon a quasi-contract, for a quantum meruit. There is no such alternative when a marriage fails.

Under § 6 of the Circuit Court of Appeals Act of March 3, 1891, 26 Stat. 826, the certificate of the Circuit Court of Appeals as to questions or propositions of law concerning which it desires instruction must present a distinct point of law, clearly stated, which can be decided without passing upon the weight or effect of the advice on which the question arises, and if not so presented this court is without jurisdiction; and where the question certified practically brings up the entire case, and this court is asked to pass upon the validity of a contract and indicate what the final judgment should be, the certificate will be dismissed and the questions not answered.
THIS case is before the court upon a question certified by the Circuit Court of Appeals under the sixth section of the Judiciary Act of March 3, 1891, providing that in every case within its appellate jurisdiction a Circuit Court of Appeals may certify to this court any questions or propositions of law concerning which it desires instruction for the proper decision of such case. 26 Stat. 826, c. 517.

entirely disassociated from the general proceedings of the case in which the contempt is charged to have been committed. I think, therefore, that this court has jurisdiction and ought to inquire and determine the alleged rights of the plaintiff in error. As, however, the court decides that it does not have jurisdiction, and has dismissed the writ of error, it would not be fit for me to express any opinion on the merits of the case.

CHANLER v. KELSEY, COMPTROLLER OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
ERROR TO THE SURROGATE'S COURT OF THE COUNTY OF NEW
YORK AND STATE OF NEW YORK.
No. 240. Argued March 14, 1907.-Decided April 15, 1907.
Notwithstanding the common law rule that estates created by the execution of a power take effect as if created by the original deed, for some purposes the execution of the power is considered the source of title.
This court must follow the decision of the state court in determining that the essential thing to transfer an estate is the exercise of a power of appointment..
The imposition of a transfer or inheritance tax under ch. 284, Laws of New York, 1897, on the exercise of a power of appointment in the same manner as though the estate passing thereby belonged absolutely to the person exercising the power, does not, although the power was created prior to the act, deprive the person taking by appointment, and who would not otherwise have taken the estate, of his property without due process of law in violation, of the Fourteenth Amendment; nor does it violate the obligation of any contract within the protection of the impairment clause of the Federal Constitution.
176 N. Y. 486, sustained.

review a decision of the Court of Appeals of the State sustaining an order of the Surrogate's Court,.which imposed a transfertax upon certain estates arising under appointment by Laura Astor Delano, deceased. 176 N. Y. 486.
Laura Astor Delano was the daughter of William B. Astor.
Upon the occasion of her marriage in 1844 to Frank H. Delano, Mr. Astor executed a deed in the nature of a marriage settlement, conveying certain real and personal property to trustees in trust to pay the income to said Laura Delano for life, with remainder to her issue i. fee, or in default of issue, to her heirs in fee; and giving ler power in her discretion to appoint the remainder "amongst her said issue or heirs, in such manner and proportions as she may appoint by instrument in its nature testamentary, to be acknowledged by her as a deed and in the presence of two witnesses or published by her as a will."
In the years '1848, 1849 and 1865 William B. Astor made other deeds, by way of addition to the original marriage settlement, substantially similar in their terms. That of 1848 conveyed certain real estate to Mrs. Delano for life, with power of appointment as to said premises, or any part thereof, "to an(1 among her said issue, brothers, sister Alida, or their issue, in such manner and proportions as she may appoint by instrument iii its nature testamentary, to be acknowledged by her as a deed in the presence of two witnesses or acknowledged by her as a will." The deed of 1849 conveyed to trustee certificates for $50,000 of the public debt of Ohio; "to hold the same in trust for the benefit of Laura Astor Delano during her life, and at her death to transfer and convey the capital of the said stock to her issue, but in case she left no issue, then ,to her surviving brothers and sister Alida and to the issue of any of them who dio'l leaving issue; and said instrument contained a power of appointment to Laura Astor Delano as follows: 'Provided, however, that it shall be lawful for the said Laura, by any instrument executed duly as a will of personal estate, to dispose of the said capital unto and amongst her

issue, brothers, sister and their issue, in such shares and proportions as she may think fit and upon such limitations, by way of trust or otherwise, as in her discretion may be lawfully devised.' " These deeds were- absolutely irrevocable, took effect upon delivery, and 'Were not made in contemplation of the death of the grantor.
Laura A. Delano died June 15, 1902, in Geneva, Switzerland, leaving no descendants. By her last will and testament, duly admitted to probate in the county of New York on October 14, 1902, she exercised the power of appointment conferred in the deeds from her father in favor of the plaintiffs in error.
One of the plaintiffs in error, Arthur Astor Carey, a grandson of William B. Astor, and an appointee to whom Mrs. Delano had appointed the property originally conveyed by the deeds of 1848 and 1849, took an appeal f'om the order of the Surrogate's Court refusing to dismiss the petition to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, vhere it Wvas held that the act under which the tax was imposed, as applied to this case, was unconstitutional. Matter of Delano,, 82 App. Div. 147. The state comptroller appealed to the Court of Appeals from the decision of the Appellate Division.
That court sustained the rightto impose the transfer tax
upon the interests appointed by Mrs. Delano under the powers
created by the deeds above referred to. Subsequent decisions were made pro jorma and a final order on the last remittitur
of the Court of Appeals was: made in the Surrogate's Court, and
the case brought here by all the plaintiffs in error.

Mr. Lucius H. Beers for plaintiff in error: The power of the State to take property by heans of a succession tax arises only when the succession is caused by the death of the former owner of the property taken. Death is the generating source from which the particular taxing power takes its being. Knowlton v. Moore, 178 U. S. 41, 56; Cohen v. Brewster, 203 I. S.543, 550; Mager v.

Alston, 94 Tennessee, 674; Kochersperger v. Drake, 167 Illinois, 122; Strode v. Commonwealth; 52 Pa. St. 181.
The validity of a succession tax depends, not on the general taxing power of the State, but on the existence of a power in the State to regulate the particular succession sought to be "taxed.'
In a series of decisions this court and the New York Court of Appeals have held that this is not a tax on property or a tax on persons. United States v. Perkins, 163 U. S. 625, 629.
The powers under which this property was appointed to the plaintiffs in error were created by deed inter vivos and that fact distinguishes this case from the case of Orr v. Gilman, 183 U. S. 278, where the power was created by will. See also Cahen V. Brewster, 203,U. S., 543, 551, where the precise distinction here contended for is pointed out.
The amendment .of 1897 was not an exercise of the State's general power to tax, but was intended to impose a succession tax.
It is not necessary for the court to consider here, whether the statute would be constitutional if it were regarded as an exercise of the general taxing power of the State, for -the New York Court of Appeals has in this case held that the statute in question "does not attempt to impose a tax upon property, but upon the exercise of the power of appointment." See Matter of Pell, 171 .N. Y. 48.
There has been no succession to the remainders originally transferred by the deeds of 1844, 1848 and 1849 which would permit the imposition of a succession tax.
There can be powers which make the property involved practically the property of the donee, but those must give the donee the unlimited power of appointment. Such powers the

law treats as tantamount to ownership, at least so far as the rights of creditors are concerned. Here the powers are in trust and were limited to be exercised only in favor of certain descendants of the creator of the power. For these distinctions see Matter of Lansing, 182 N. Y. 238.
The instrument by which Mrs. Delano exercised these powers of appointment created by deed was not a "will" in so far as it exercised those powers.
The imposition of a tax under the amendment of 1897 will deprive the plaintiffs in error'of property without due process of law.
The legislature has based this exaction on an hypothesis as to the facts, which it deliberately recognizes to be a false hypothesis.
In this case there has been no succession, and there can be no succession tax here unless it is within the power of the legislature to avoid constitutional limitations by "deeming" the facts to be what they are not.
'States have repeatedly attempted to treat an appointment as a succession for the purpose of collecting a succession tax, but such attempts have uniformly failed for the reason that an appointment is not legally a succession because the appointed property does not belong to the donee of the power. Emmons v. Shaw, 171 Massachusetts, 410; Commonwealth v. Duffield, 12 Pa. St. 277; Commonwealth v. Williams, 13 Pa. St. 29; Matter of Stewart, 131 N. Y. 274, 281; Matter of Harbeck, 161 N. Y. 211.
The amendment of 1897 in imposing a succession tax on the property of the plaintiffs in error impaire(d the obligation of a contract.

The clause of the United States Constitution providing that no State shall pass a law impairing the obligation of contracts applies to grants and other executed contracts, as well as to executory contracts. Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch, 87, 136.

Mr. David B. Hill for defendant in error: The instrument by which Mrs. Delano exercised the powers of appointment was a "will." Rev. Stat., Part 2, chap. I, title II, Art. III, § 110, or 1 Rev. Stats. 735, § 110. At the time of the making of the deeds herein, Ladra Astor Delano had the right given by § 110 above, to make a will for the purpose of exercising the power given by said deeds. William B. Astor is presumed to have made thesb deeds with ktowledge of this provision of law. The decision of the Court of Appeals of the State of New York that the statute, chapter 284 of the laws of 1897, subdivision 5 of § 220 of the Tax Law, does not violate any provision of the constitution of the State of New York will be regarded as conclusive upon this court upon that .question. Orr v. Gilman, 183 N. Y. 278; People ex rel. Met. St. Ry. Co. v. N. Y. State Board of Tax Com'rs, 199 U. S. 1; Seneca Nation v. Christie,'162 U. S. 283; Missouri R. R. Co. v. Haber, 169 U. S.613; Smiley v. Kansas, 196 U. S.447; Hibben v. Smith, 191 U. S.310. The legislature of the State of New York had the right to enact chapter 284 of the laws of 1897 (now subdivision 5 of § 220 of the Tax Law), and the same is not a violation of any of the provisions of the Constitution of the United States. The legislature by this act does not impose a tax upon property, but it does impose a tax upon the exercise of a power of appointment. It can make no difference when the right was given to the exercise of the power, or how it was created. No tax is made upon the giving of the power, but only upon the exercise by

the donee of the power of appointment. It does not impair
the obligation of any contract between William B. Astor and the plaintiffs in error, made prior to the passage and enactment of the statute, nor does it deprive the plaintiffs in error of their property without due process of law, or deny to them the equal protection of the laws. People ex rel. Eisrnan-v. Ronner, 185 N. Y. 293; United States v. Perkins, 163 U. S. 625; McMillan v. Anderson, 95 U. S. 37. .

MR. JUSTICE DAY, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court.

The tax in controversy was imposed under an amendment of the general transfer-tax law of the State of New York, chapter 284, Laws of 1897, which provide.s as follows:.
"Whenever any person or corporition shall exercise the power of appointment derived from any disposition of property made either before or after the passage of this act, such appointment when made shall be deemed, a transfer, taxable under the provisions of this act, in the same manner as though the property to which such appointment relates belonged absolutely to the donee of such power and had been-bequeathed or devised by such donee by will; andfwlenever any person or corporation possessing such a power of appointment so derived shall omit or fail to exercise the same within the time provided therefor, in whole or in part, a transfer taxable under the provisions of this act shall be deemed to take place to the extent of such omissions or failure,. in the same manner as though the persons or corporations thereby becoming entitled

to the possession or enjoyment of the property to which such power related had succeeded thereto by a will of the donee of the power failing to exercise such power, taking effect at the time of such omission or failure."
The validity of this tax was attacked in the courts of New York upon objections pertaining to both the Federal and state constitutions. The latter are not open here, and we shall consider the case only so far as it relates to the objections made to the validity of this statute by reason of alleged violations of the Federal Constitution. These are: First, that by the imposition of the tax the property of the beneficiaries is taken without due process of law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment; and, second, that such taxation violates the obligation of a contract within the protection of section 10 of Article I of the Federal Constitution.
The objection that the property is taken without due process of law is based upon the argument that the estate in remainder was derived from the deeds of William B. Astor and not under the power of appointment received from those deeds by Mrs. Laura A. Delano. In support of this contention, common law authorities are cited to the proposition that an estate created by the execution of a power takes effect in the same manner as if it had been created by the deed which raised the power; that the beneficiary takes, not under the execution of the power by the donee, but by authority and under grant from the grantor, in like manner as if the power 'and the instrument , which created it had been incorporated into one instrument. 4 Kent's Com. 327; 2 Washburn, Real Property, 320. The argument is that the estate which arose by the exercise of the power came from William B. Astor and not from Laura A. Delano, and was vested long before the passage of the amendmient of 1897, under the authority of which the tax was imposed, and to tax the exercise of the power therefore takes property without due process of law.
However technically correct it may be to say that the estate came from th, donor and not from the don e of th, power, it is

self-evident that it was only upon the exercise of the power that the estate in the plaintiffs in error became complete. Without the exercise of the power of appointment the estates in remainder would have gone to all in the class named in the deeds of William B. Astor. By the exercise of this power some were divested of their estates and the same were vested in others. It may be that the donee had no interest in the estate as owner, but it took her act of appointment to finally transfer the estate to some of the class and take it from others.
Notwithstanding the common law rule that estates created by the execution of a power take effect as if created by the original deed, for some purposes the execution of the power is considered the source of title. It is so within the purpose of the registration acts. A person deriving title under an appointment is considered as claiming under the donee within
the meaning of a covenant for quiet enjoyment. 2 Sugden on Powers, 3d ed., 19.
"So on an issue to try whether the plaintiff was entitled by two writings, or any other, purporting a will of J. S., and the evidence was of a feoffment to the use of such person as J. S. should appoint by his will, in which case it was contended that the devisees were in by the feoffment and not by the will, the court held that this was only fictione juris, for that they were not in without the will, and therefore that was the principal part of the title, and such proof was good enough and pursuant to the issue, and a verdict was accordingly given for the plaintiff." 2 Sugden on Powers, 19, citing Bartlett v. Ramsdern, 1 Keb. 570.
So, in the present case, the plaintiffs in error are not in without the exercise of the power by the will of Mrs. Delano.
By statute in England, for the purposes of taxation, it has been provided that the donee of the power shall be regarded, in case of a general power, as the one from whom the-estate came. In Attorney General v. Upton et al., L., R. 1 Ex. 224, the Court of Exchequer had under consideration the Succession Duty Act (16, 17 Vict. c. 51), and it was held that the

appointee under a general power of appointment, taking effect on the death happening since the commencement of the act, takes succession from the donee of the power. The testator, Admiral Fanshawe, by will devised certain lands to the use of his wife, Caroline Fanshawe, for life, remainder to such use as she should by deed or will appoint, and, in default of appointment, for the use and benefit of testator's nephews, C. F. and J. F. Fanshawe, and their issue. She by deed appointed to the use that trustees should after her death receive an annuity during the lives of the wife of the testator's nephew, and of the children of the nephew by her, in trust for the separate use of the wife, Elizabeth Fanshawe. Section 4 of the act, which is there construed, provides that any person having a general power of appointment, under any disposition of property, taking effect upon' the death of any person dying after th6 time appointed for the commencement of the act, shall, in the event of his making any appointment thereunder, be deemed to be entitled at the time of his exercising such power to the property or interest thereby appointed as a succession derived from the donor of the power. All the judges agreed that under section 4 of the act the nephew's wife took the annuity as a succession from the testator's widow and not from the testator himself; that, therefore, a duty of ten per cent was payable. Bramwell, B., was of opinion that the duty was also payable under section 2, which provides that "every past or future disposition of property, by reason whereof any person has or shall become beneficially entitled to any property shall be deemed to have conferred, or to confer, on the person entitled by reason of any such disposition . . . a succession." In speaking of this section the Baron said:
"Now, will these annuitants take by reason of the will of Admiral Fanshawe? We must look, not at the causa remota, but at the causa proxima, and that is the disposition of Caroline Fanshawe. Again, the act says, that the term predecessor 'shall denote the settlor, disponer, testator, obligor, ancestor, or other person from whom the interest of the successor is or

shall be derived.' From whom, then, is the interest derived? As I said in Barker'scase (1), these are ordinary English words, and ought to be construed by lawyers as ordinary Englishmen would construe them. Now, not one man in a hundred would say that this interest was derived from Admiral Fanshawe or from any other person than the donee of the power. I do not mean to deny or attempt to cast any doubt on the rule of law that an appointee takes his estate from the donor of the power, but I say that it is a rule not applicable to the construction of this statute, and it is not true, as is supposed, that there is any decision of the House of Lords to the contrary."
The learned Baron seems to have gone farther, as, to section 2, than his brethren were willing to. Attorney Generalv. Mitchef/, L. R. 6 Q. B. I). 548. His observations are nevertheless suggestive..
While the entire bench recognized the common law rule that the estate is taken to come from the donor of the power, it enforced the statutory change as to a subsequent exercise of the power, treating the estate as coming from the donee, by whose act it was appointed to the beneficiary.
The statute of New York in question acts equally upon all persons similarly situated. It affects an estate which only became complete by the exercise of a power subsequent to its enactment.
'The exercise of the power bestowing property in the present
case was made by will. And we need not consider the case, expressly reserved by the Court of Appeals in its opinion, as to the result if it had been exercised by deed.
That the will was effectual to transfer the estate was ruled by the Court of Appeals, and its decision on this question is binding here, as was held in Orr v. Gilman, 183 U. S. 278, which came here for a review of a decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals of New York, rendered in Matter of Dows, 167 N. Y. 227, a case which arose under the same statute of 1897. In that case the testator devised real estate in trust to pay the income to his son for life, and, upon his death, to vest abso-

lutely and at once in his children and the issue of his deceased children, as his son should appoint by will. If, however, the son should die intestate the estate was to vest absolutely and at once in his children then living, and the issue of the deceased children. The son exercised the power of appointment by his last will, probated in 1899. The Court of Appeals held that the property was subject to the taxation imposed by the act of 1897; that such 'tax was on the right of succession and not on the property. "It became important in that case to determine whether the property passed by virtue of the will of the donor, David Dows, Senior, and then became vested in the grandchildren, or only became vested in them when the power of appointment was exercised by the will of' David Dows,'Junior.
This court held that the answer to this question must, of course, be furnished by the Court of Appeals in that case. 183 U. S.282. In other words, the Court of Appeals of New York had the exclusive right to construe instruments of title in that State, and determine for itself the creation and vesting of estates through wills under the laws of the State. "The Court of Appeals held that it was the execution of the power of appointment which subjected grantees under it to the transfer tax. This conclusion is binding upon this court in so far as' it involves a construction of the will and of the statutes." 183 U. S. 288. In the present case the New York Court of Appeals has spoken in no uncettain language upon. the subject:
"As the tax is imposed upon the exercise of the power, it is unimportant how the power was created. The existence of the power is the important fact, for what may be done under it is not affected by its origin. If created by deed its efficiency is the same as if it had been created in the same form by will. No more and no less could be-done by virtue of it in 'the one case than in the other. Its effective agency to produce the result intended is neither strengthened nor weakened by the nature of thiT instrument used by the donor of the power to create it.' The power, however or whenever created, authorized the donee by her will to divest certain defeasible estates

and to vest them absolutely in one person. If this authority had been conferred by will, instead of by deed, the right to act would have been precisely the same, and the power would have
neither gained nor lost in force. . . . 176 N. Y. 493. "As we said through Judge Cullen in the Dows case: 'What-
ever be the technical source of title of 'the grantee under a power of appointment, it cannot be denied that in reality and substance it is the execution of the power that gives to the grantee the property passing under it.' This accords with the statutory definition of a power as applied to real estate, for it includes an authority to create or revoke an estate therein. (Real Property Law, §111.) Such was the effect of the exer-
cise of the power under consideration, for it both revoked and created estates in the real property and the interests in the personal property. No tax is laid on the power, or on the property, or en the original disposition by deed, but simply upon the exercise of the power by will, as an effective transfer for the purposes of the act." 176 N. Y. 494.
As in Orr v. Gilman, 183 U. S. supra, we must accept this decision of the New York Court of Appeals holding that it is the exercise of the power which is the essential thing to transfer the estates upon which the tax is imposed. That power was exercised under the will of Laura Delano, a right which was conferred upon her under the laws of the State of New York and for the exercise of which the statute was competent to impose the tax in the exercise of the sovereign power of the legislature over the right to make a disposition of property by will. United States v. Perkins, 163 U. S.625, 628; Magoun v. Illinois Trust & Savings Bank, 170 U. S.283, 288.
We cannot say that property has been taken without due process of law, within the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment, by the manner in which the Court of Appeals has construed and enforced this statute. Orr v. Gilman, 183 U. S. supra.
Nor do we perceive that the effect has been to violate any contract right of the parties. It is said that this is so, because

instead of disposing of the entire estate, ninety-five per cent of the property included in the power has been transferred and five per cent taken by the State; but as there was a valid exercise of the taxing power of the State, we think the iiuposition of such a tax violated no contract because it resulted in the reduction of the estate.
Certainly the remaindermen had no contract with the donor or with the State. For whether the remaindermen received aliquot parts of the entire estate or the same was divested in whole or in part for the benefit of others in the class, depended upon the exercise of the power by the donee. The State was not deprived of its sovereign right to exercise the taxing power upon the making of a will in the future by which the estate was given to the appointees.
We find no error in the judgment of the Surrogate's Court entered on the remittitur from the Court of Appeals, and the same is

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES, with whom was MR. JUSTICE MOODY, dissenting.

I have the misfortune to differ from the majority of my brethren in this case, and although the argument which seemed and still seems to me unanswerable was presented and has not prevailed, I think that the principles involved are of sufficient importance to justify a statement of the reasons for my disgent. A state succession tax stands on different grounds from a similar tax by the United States or a general state tax upon transfers. It is more unlimited in its possible extent, if not altogether unlimited, and therefore it is necessary that the boundaries of the power to levy such taxes should be accurately understood and defined.
I always have believed that a state inheritance tax was an exercise of the power of regulating the devolution of property by inheritanco or will upon the death of the bwner,-a power

which belongs to the States; and I have been fortified in my belief by the utterances of this court from the time of Chief Justice Taney to the present day. Mager v. Grima, 8 How. 490, 493; United States v. Perkins, 163 U. S. 625, 627, 628; Magoun v. Illinois Trust & Savings Bank, 170 U. S. 283, 288; Plummer v. Coler, 178 U. S. 115, 124, 126, 137; Billings v.
Illinois, 188 U. S. 97, 104; Campbell v. California, 200 U. S. 87, 94; Cahen v. Brewster, 203 U. S. 543, 550. See also Matter of Sherman, 153 N. Y. 1, 4. For that reason the power is more
unlimited than the power of a State to tax transfers generally, or the power of the United States to levy an inheritance tax. The distinction between state and United States inheritance taxes was recognized in Knowlton v. Moore, 178 U. S. 41, 58, and whatever may be thought of the decision in Snyder v. Bettman, 190 U. S. 249, I do not understand it to import a denial of the distinction, reaffirmed by the dissenting members of the court. 190 U. S. 256.
If then a given state tax must be held to be a succession tax in order to maintain its validity, or if in fact it is held to be a succession tax by the state court of which it is the province to decide that matter, it follows that such a tax cannot be levied except where there is a succession, and when some element or step necessary to complete it still is wanting when the tax law goes into effect. If some elepient is wanting at that time, the succession depends, for taking effect, on the continu-
ance pf the permissioi to succeed or grant of the right on the part of the State; and, as the grant may .be withdrawn, it may
be qualified by a tax. But if there is no succession, or if the succession has fully vested, or has passed beyond dependence upon the continuing of the State's permission or grant, an attempt to levy a tax under the power to regulate succession would be an attempt to appropriate property in a way which
the Fourteenth Amendment has been construed to forbid, No matter what other taxes might be levied, a succession tax could not be,. and so it has been decided in New York. Matter of Pell, 171 N. Y. 48, 55; Matter of Seaman, 147 N. Y. 69.

HOLMES and MOODY, JJ., dissenting.

It is not denied that the tax under consideration is a succession tax. The Court of Appeals treated it as such in the present case. It said:"If the power had been exercised by deed a different question would have arisen, but it was exercised by will and owing to the full and complete control by the legislature of the making, the fori and the substance of wills, it can impose a charge or tax for doing anything by will."
Matter of Delano, 176 N. Y. 486, 494, reversing S. C., 82 App. Div. 147. That it was such a tax and valid for that reason was decided in Matter of Dows, 167 N. Y. 227, affirmed by this court. Orr v. Gilman, 183 U. S. 278, adopting the New York view. 183 U. S. 289. And these decisions and some of the other decisions of this court cited above were relied upon by the Court of Appeals. 176 N. Y. 492. See further Matter of Vanderbilt, 50 App. Div. 246; aff'd 163 N. Y. 597; Matter of Lansing, 182 N. Y. 238, 248. Probably the tax would be invalid for other local reasons besides those mentioned in Matter of Dows, but for the construction which it has received. Matter of Pell, 171 N. Y. 48, 60.
This being then a succession tax, I should have thought it plain that there was no succession for it to operate upon. More precisely, even if otherwise any element of succession could have been found, a matter that I think wbuld need explanation, the execution of the power did not depend in any way upon the continued co6peration of the laws of New York by way of permission or grant. I am not concerned to criticise the statement of the Court of Appeals that in substance it is the execution of the power that gives to the grantee the property passing under it. It is-enough if it is remembered thiat the instrument executing the power derives none of its efficiency in that respect from the present laws of New York. It is true that the instrument happens to be a will, and that it could not have operated as a will except by the grant of the privilege from the State at the time when Mrs. Delano died. But what would execute the power depended, in the first place, upon the deed creating it, and if that deed did not

require a will but only an instrument otherwise sufficiently characterized, it did not matter whether the instrument was also good as a will or not. Ela v. Edwards, 16 Gray, 91, 100.
What the deeds which I am considering required was "an instrument in its nature testamentary to be acknowledged by her (Mrs. Delano) as a deed in the presence of two witnesses or published by her as a will." The language was chosen carefully, I presume, in view of the incapacities of married women at that time. By the terms used a will was unnecessary. It was enough if Mrs. Delano sealed and acknowledged an instrument in its nature testamentary in the presence of two witnesses, whether it was good as a will or not. Strong v. Wilkins, 1 Barb. Ch. 9, 13; Heath v. Withington, 6 Cush. 497. This she did. In Orr v. Gilman, 183 U. S. 278, the power was created by will, and, what is more obviously material, it required a will for its execution, and so might be held to invoke and submit itself to the law in force when the execution should take place. Therefore that case has no bearing upon this. The ground upon which this tax is imposed is, I repeat, the right of the State to regulate or, if it sees fit, to destroy inheritances. If it might not have appropriated the whole it cannot appropriate any part by the law before us. And I also repeat that it has no bearing upon the matter that by a different law the State might have derived an equal revenue from these donees in the form of a tax. I do. not understand it to be suggested that the State without compensation could have appropriated the remainderafter Mrs. Delano's life, which Mr. Astor parted with in 1844 and shortly following years. If it could not have done so I am unable to see on what ground this tax is not void. The English decisions throw no light upon the question before us because they are concerned only with the construction of statutes which, however construed, are law.

MR. JUSTICE MOODY concurs in this dissent.

No.-179. Argued October 9, 1906.-Decided October 22. 1906.
Testator created a trusf for his children including therein all of his property except one parcel, the income whereof was to go to a niece for life, the trustees to make such income up to a specified s.-'f,rnom the property in the gene'ral trust. The general trust was declared void as creating a perpetuity but not the trust for the niece. The children appealed claiming that the trust for the niece was also void. Held that
One not appealing cannot, in thiscourt, go beyond supporting the judgment and opposing every assignment of e'ror, and therefore the niece could not endeavor to sustain the validity of the trust as a whole.
The trust for the niece was not illegal, and was not so intimaqtely connected with the failing trust as to fail with it;* but the decree was modified so that the income could only be made up to the specified sum from income from property in the jurisdiction.

consequences. The disposition of the income was not a necessary element of the trust. It was an incident and an
outgrowth, and of course, dependent upon it. As the attempted trust 'embodies the general scheme or
plan of the testator as to his Washington real estate, the direction to his trustees to pay appellee forty dollars per month-being a part of the monthly income of the trust property-rests upon the void trust, so that it cannot be-established without reliance upon the void trust.

MR. USTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.

This is an appeal 'from a decree, of the Court of Appeals Qf the District- of Columbia affirming 'a decree 0f. the' Supreme Court upon a bill of review: brought by' Gabriella K. Jordan, the appellee. 'The deelee, under' review was, rendered in a suit for the construction of -the will of Thomas Kearney and for the determination of the' validity of a trust created' by it, so. far as the .same concerned land in' the District of Columbia." That decree declared the trust 'bad as .attempting to create a perpetuity. Under' the bill ,of re-vjiw the decree was modified, on demurrer, to the extent of the interest of GAbriella K.:Jordan, and the trust was declared valid .as to hn 25' App. D. C. 291.

tator's property in Washington. In item.'6, it devises this and other, property upon a trust .to be continued 'until January 1, 1928, and there and elsewhere, with the following exception, makes a fund from the Washington rents and.. j)rofits to be disposed of as directed in the will. Item 6 is as follows:
"I hereby authorize and direct that my said trustees shall during the natural life of my boved niece, Gabriella 'K, Jordan,' pay over to her regularly each month, as soon as c6llected, all rents and revenues' collected or deived from that -certain property described, in the third item hereof.as lot No. 611 'M' Street, N. W., Washington, D. C.,;, but, in case said rents and-revenues shall at any time be less than the sum of forty dollars for any one or more months; then my' said trus,tees are. hereby authorized and instructed to add to the sum, so collected a sufficient amount to make the .said amount of forty dollars foreach and every :.month; it being my de-. sire that she shall have a regular 'iicome of at leastk forty dollars per. month, and that thie same shall be -paid over to "her monthly; but if the income deri-ed from said premises shall' amount to a sum'in excess of forty -dollars .per monthshe shall have the whole thereof."
Item 7 directs the trustee-to letall the Washington prop-' erty except 611. M street, and.out of the rents to pay ninety dollars a month to the testator's daughter, onStance K. Vertner, as ordered in item 5; the' residue, so far as necessary, to be applied t6 the sdpport and education*?of her three children, named, with further pi ovisions., Item 8 gives tfie remainder in fee of 611 M street to the .testator's grandson, provided that if Gabriella Jordan dies before Jaiiuary 1, 1928, he shall only receive the rents and profits, and if she dies before the grandson reaches the. -age of. twenty-two the..rents shall be disposed of as provided, in ,item 7 a to :other Washington property. In item 21 the testator, "for fear that' there may be some difficulty in 'construing the different provisions" of the will, states his interftion that all the money

arising from the Washington rents, "except that which is to go to Gabriella K. Jordan, shall be placed in a common fund for the payment (1) of taxes, insurance and repairs on said property and of the premises at Luray, Virginia; (2) of (90) ninety dollars per month to my said daughter, Constance K. Vertner during her natural life; (3) for the aupport, education and maintenance of my said three Vertner grandchildren until Lillie K. Vertner shall have arrived at the age of nineteen years, and until Edmund K. and Thomas K. 'shall have arrived at the age of twenty-two years, respectively."
The persons in whose favor were made the provisions which were adjudged bad were one of the testator's heirs, his daughter, Constance K. Vertner, and the children of Constance. The daughter plealed that the other heir, Edmund Kearney, also provided for in the will, died, leaving her his heir, that the trust was bad, and, by implication, that she was entitled to the property which it embraced. She now is dead. By the original decree the whole trust fund, including that given to Gabriella Jordan, went to the testator's heirs as property undisposed of by the will. The only person dissatisfied with that decree was Gabriella Jordan, and on the other hand the executor and children of Constance are the only appellants from the dectee on review. According to the rule that has been laid down in this court, Gabriella, as she did not appeal, cannot go beyond supporting the decree and opposing every assignment of error. Mount Pleasant v. Beckwith, 100 U. S. 514, 527; The Stephen Morgan, 94 U. S. 599; Chittenden v. Brewster, 2 Wall. 191, 196; Field v. Barber Asphalt Paving Co., 194 U. S.- 618, 621. We assume this rule to be correct. Although her counsel attempted to argue the validity of the trust as'a whole, and other questions, we assume, without deciding, the decree to be unimpeachable and -right, except so far as appealed from. Therefore we shall confine ourselves to considering whether thegift to Gabriella is so intimately connected with the failing icheme as to fail with it.

Opinion of the Court.

It would be a. strong thing to say that we gather from this will an intent that, if the trust so far as it concerns the testator's descendants should fail because they prefer to take the property by intestacy free from the limitations of the will, therefore the one gift outside his family should be defeated also. The trust is not a metaphysical entity or a Prince Rupert's drop which flies to pieces if broken in any part. It is a provision to benefit descendants and a niece. There is no general principle by which the benefits must stand or fall together. It is true that all the Washington property was given to the trustees in one clause and that a part -of the scheme in favor of the testator's grandchildren was the creation of a fund from the rents. But, as is stated in item 21, 611 TM street was excepted from the scheme, and the whole income of this lot, or in other words an equitable estate in the specified land, is given to Gabriella Jordan for life by item 6. If that were all we see no reason for a doubt that that gift would be good, whether the gifts to the other beneficiaries were good or not. The fact that the testator's daughter takes all the rest of the property instead of her childien getting a postponed interest in a part, is no ground for denying to the niece the life estate given to her in an identified and excepted piece of land. It does not make the case any worse that a part of the property thus going to the testator's daughter is
the remainder in the' estate given to his niece. The appellants lay hold of the instructions to the trustees
to add to the rents enough to make Gabriella's income up to forty dollars a month, and argue as if the gift were in substance only a gift of forty dollars a month from a fund that cannot be established. Such is not the fact. The gift is primarily and in any event a gift of the income of 611 M street. But whatever may be the fate of the rest of the trust we see nothing to hinder the trustees from keeping the income up to forty dollars from the other property devised to them. Of course they could not derive income from property nof included in the trust, and only the property included is charged with

the liability. The decree may be modified by inserting after the words "against his entire estate" the words "in the District of Columbia."
It is objected in argument, although not in the pleadings, that the widow of Edmund Kearney has a right of dower in the Washington estate which descended to him, and that she should have been made party to the bill of review. The fact of the widow's existence does not appear of record as against the appellee, and we agree with the Court of Appeals that the objection is made too late.
