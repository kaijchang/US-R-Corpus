McCAFFREY v. MANOGUE.

196 U. S.

Syllabus.

MR. JUSTICE MOKENNA delivered the opinion of the court.

This case was submitted with Plansgan v Sierra County. It is also an action for the recovery of a sum of $2,100, alleged to be due for license tax, and $50 damages. The taxes were unposed under an ordinance of the county of Plumas, substantially similar to the ordinance passed on in Flanigan v Sierra County. The action was brought in the Superior Court of Plumas County and removed, upon the petition of the petitioners herein, to the Circuit Court for the Northern District of California. In that court, petitioners demurred to the complaint, which, being overruled, and they declining to answer, judgment was taken against them by default. It was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals.
The questions are identical with those passed on in Flansgan v Sierra County, and on the authority of that case the
Judgment s reversed and cause remanded for further proceed-

McCAFFREY v. MANOGUE.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
No. 131. Argued January 17,18, 1905.-Decided February 20, 1905.
The policy of the law in favor of the heir yields to the intention of the testator if clearly expressed or manifested. The rule of law that a devise of lands without words of limitation or description gives a life estate only, does not apply, and devises will be held to be of the fee, where it is plain that the testator's intention was to dispose of his whole estate equally between his heirs, and there is no residuary clause indicating that he intended passing less than all of his estate, and all of his heirs at law are devisees under the will.

THE question involved in this case is the construction of the will of Hugh McCaffrey, deceased. It was duly admitted to probate and recorded in the Supreme Court of the District. It is as follows:

"WASHINGTON, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA,
"April Thsrteth, 1896.
"In the name of God, being now in good health and sound in mind and body I hereby certify and declare this to be my last will and testament, hereby annulling and revoking any and all wills previously made.
"I give and bequeath to my daughter, Mary A. Quigley, house number 301 at southwest corner of 11th and C streets southeast, being in lot number 5, in square 970, with the store and dwelling, stock and fixtures, and lot on which it stands, also houses numbers 13 and 15 6th street southeast with lots on which they stand, being parts of lots 19 and 20 in square 841, also any money in bank to my account at the time of my death, also any money due to me, also any building association stock.

"HUGH MCCAFFRBY. [SEAL.]"

The devisees in the will were the only heirs of the testator. On the tenth of July, 1897, Mary A. Quigley, died leaving surviving four children, the appellants Catherine L., Margaret, Mary and Joseph Quigley Edward Quigley, her husband, also an appellant, survived her. She left a will, which was duly admitted to record, by which she devised all her estate to Catherine L. and Edward Quigley in trust for her children. Francis T. McCaffrey, son of Hugh, and one of the devisees in the latter's will, died October 20, 1898, leaving as heirs at law his brothers and sisters, the children of his deceased sister, Mary A. Quigley, and his nephew, Frank Foley He left a will, by which he devised and bequeathed all of the property to his sister, Lizzie C. Manogue, and his brothers, William A. and James B. McCaffrey, "absolutely and in fee simple, according to the nature of the property, as tenants in common, but not as joint tenants." At the time of his death he was seized and possessed of the real estate devised to hun by his
father. James B. McCaffrey has sold and conveyed the lot devised
to him to the respondent George W Manogue. Upon an attempt to sell the property devised by Francis T. MeCaffrey a doubt was raised as to the extent of the interest devised to him

and the other devisees by the will of H. McCaffrey, whether an estate for life or in fee simple. This suit was brought "to have it determined what estate each of the said devisees took thereby, and to have their title quieted as against any person or persons who may claim adversely to the same as heirs of said Hugh McCaffrey, or under such heirs."
It was decreed by the trial court that only life estates were devised by the will, and the decree was affirmed by the Court of Appeals. 22 App. D C. 385.

Mr Arthur A. Btrney, with whom Mr 0 B. Hallam and Mr Henry F Woodard were on the brief, for appellants:
In McCaffrey v Little, 20 App. D C. 116, the main question herein was before the court but not decided. Mrs. Quigley took a fee simple. Collier's Case, 6 Coke, 16, King v Ackerman, 2 Black, 408, Doe v Holmes, 8 Dunf. & East, 1, Sharswood's Blackstone, citing Goodlittle v Maddern, 7 East. 500; Doe v Clarke, 8 New Rep. 349; Roe v Dan, 3 Man. & Sel. 522, Baddeley v Leapzngwell, Wilm. Notes, 235. The Court of Appeals held that because the proofs taken by appellees showed that out of the personal estate bequeathed to Mrs. Quigley "a large surplus must necessarily remain to her after the discharge of all possible demands and expenses," the charge should be construed as upon the personal estate and not the person. But the court had no right to look beyond the face of the will in determining its construction, and should have rejected the testimony as wholly incompetent to diminish the estate which the fact of the personal charge defined as created in Mrs. Quigley by the terms of the devise. The court cited no authority for its reception of this evidence and ignored authoritative decisions in doing so. King v Ackerman, 2 Black, 408, Barber v Pittsburg &c. Railway, 166 U S. 109; Allen v Allen, 18 How 385, West v Fitz, 109 Illinois, 438, Powell on Devises, Jarman, § 379, 2 Jarman on Wills.
If the limited construction of the several devises to life estates only is declared, it must result that the testator,

McCAFFREY v. 1IANOGUE.

196 U. S.

Argument for Appellees.

Hugh McCaffrey, died intestate as to the remainder after the expiration of the life estates, for there is no residuary devise, or other language to dispose of the remainders. It is unreasonable to suppose that this was the testator's intention. Kennedy v Alexander, 21 App. D. C. 424, Hardenburgh v Ray, 151 U S. 112, Abbott v Essex Co., 18 How 202. The other devisees took fee simples also.
Where from the fact of such condition in one of several devises, it is manifest the testator intended to pass a fee in such devise, the fact that in the others he has used similar terms (although without attaching conditions), will, in the absence of words of contrary import, establish a like intent in those other devises, and the beneficiaries will take in fee. Cases cited supra and Cook v Holmes, 11 Massachusetts, 529; Butler v Butler, 2 Mackey, 96, 104, White v Creushaw, 5 Mackey, 113.

Mr Edwnn Forrestand Mr A. A. Hoehling, Jr.,for appellees A devise without words of limitation or inheritance passes only a life estate. The authorities sustaining it are uniform in every jurisdiction, and the same rule of decision obtains in the District of Columbia, with the exception only of cases coming within the provisions of the Code, of which, however, the case at bar is not one. 2 Jarman on Wills, 267, 2 Redfield on Wills, 321, Farrarv Ayres, 5 Pick. 404, McAleer v Schneider, 2 App. D. C. 461, McCaffrey v Little, 20 App. D C. 116, Wrght v Denn, 10 Wheat. 204, 236. And this is so notwithstanding the testator in the will may have declared an intention to dispose of his whole estate, although here there is absolutely no expression by testator of any intention to dispose by will of his entire estate in the property, nor does he attempt to dispose by will of his entire property
The Quigley devise cannot be enlarged by legal implication to a fee. The directions to her were not a charge upon her devise. Buggens v Yeates, 8 Vin. Abr. 72, 1 Jarman on Wills, 387, Wrght v Denn, 10 Wheat. 204, 236, Jackson v Harms,

Even if the Quigley devise is so enlarged the other devises in the will are not aided thereby

MR. JUSTICE MOKENNA, after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the court.

It will be observed that the devises are expressed in exactly
the same way To Mary A. Quigley, however, there are given several pieces of real estate, the money of the testator in bank and his building association stock. She is charged with the payment of the testator's funeral expenses and debts; also with the care of his cemetery lot. Nevertheless, neither of the lower courts distinguished between the devisees-to all was applied the rule of law that a devise of land without words of limitation or description gives a life estate only The Court of Appeals held that the charge or burden upon Mary A. Quigley to pay the funeral expenses and debts of the testator was offset by the gift to her of personal property It is insisted that the ruling is contrary to the decision m King v. Ackerman, 2 Black, 408. It is there said. "The rule of law which gives a fee, where the devisee is charged with a sum of money, is a technical dominant rule, and intended to defeat the effect" of the artificial rule established in favor of the heir at law, that an indefinite devise of land passes nothing but a life estate. It was, however, apparent to the Court of Appeals that, to follow Kafng v Ackerman, would not execute the intention of the testator by opposing one technical rule by another, but would discriminate between his heirs and destroy the equality between them which it was the purpose of the will to create. To effect this equality the court selected, not the "dominant rule," whose virtue this court pointed out, but the other, regarding it the most commanding. It is altogether a strange tangle of technicalities. Apply either of them, or both

Opinion of the Court.

of them, and we defeat the intention of the testator. Are we reduced to this dilemma? We think not, nor need we dispute the full strength of the rule in favor of the heir at law It is not an unyielding declaration of law It cannot be applied when the intention of the testator is made plain. It cannot be applied when the purpose of the testator, as seen in the will, cannot be carried out by a devise of a less estate than the fee. Bell County v Alexander, 22 Texas, 350. The policy of the law in favor of the heir yields, we repeat, to the intention of a testator if clearly expressed or manifested. That policy, the reason for it and the elements of it, is expressed strongly by Mr. Justice Story in Wmght v Denn ex dem. Page, 10 Wheat. 204, 227, 228
"Where there are no words of limitation to a devise, the general rule of law is, that the devisee takes an estate for life only, unless, from the language there used, or from other parts of the will, there is a plain intention to give a larger estate, we say, a plain intention, because, if it be doubtful or conjectural, upon the terms of the will, or if full legal effect can be given to the language, without such an estate, the general rule prevails. It is not sufficient, that the court may entertain a private belief that the testator intended a fee, it must see that he has expressed that intention, with reasonable certainty, on the face of his will. For the law will not suffer the heir to be disinherited upon conjecture. He is favored by its policy; and though the testator may disinherit him, yet the law will execute that intention only when it is put in a clear and unambiguous shape." (Italics ours.)
We think the intention of McCaffrey is "put in a clear and unambiguous shape:" He intended to dispose of his whole estate. It is true there is no introductory clause expressmg such intention, but there is no residuary clause indicating that he intended to pass less than all of his estate. And all of his heirs at law were his devisees. In other words, the very heirs for whom the rule is invoked are those among whom he distributed his property, and surely he intended a

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.

Opinion of the Court.

196 U. S.

complete distribution-to vest in each the largest interest he could give, not assigning life estates with residuary fees to the very persons to whom such life estates were devised. In other words, making each heir the successor of the other and of himself. It was evident to the Court of Appeals-it is evident to us-that he intended to make his heirs equal. Of this purpose the charge upon his daughter, Mary A. Quigley, is dominantly significant, not only in effect, but in its expression. She is given a greater quantity of real estate than the other devisees. She is given personal property besides, but, declared the testator, "she is to pay funeral expenses and other legal debts I may owe, also to care for my lot in Mount Olivet Cemetery" That charge was not intended to enlarge the quantity of interest in the real estate devised in the sense contended for, but to make an equality between her and the other heirs and devisees, and, we repeat, that was his especial purpose. In other words, he gave her more property, not a larger interest in it. The devise to his grandson, Frank Foley, shows how carefully the testator regarded his heirs. Surely, as he regarded that grandchild as inheriting the rights which his mother might have inherited, he did not intend a disposition of his property which precluded his other grandchildren of inheriting through their parents. And this will be the result if the appellees are right. No devisee possesses an estate which can be devised to or inherited by his or her children.
Against the effect of the heirs at law of the testator being also his devisees, it may be said that it has been held that, though a testator has given a nominal legacy to his heir or declared an intention to wholly disinherit him, the inflexibility of the rule in favor of the heir has been enforced. Frogmorton v Wright, 2 W Bl. 889, Roe d. Callow v Bolton, 2 W B1. 1045, Right v Sidebotham, 2 Douglas, 730, Roe d. Peter v Daw, 3 M. & Sel. 518.
In Right v Sidebotham, Lord Mansfield felt himself constrained to enforce the rule, but he observed in protest: "I

McCAFFREY v. MANOGUE.

196 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

verily believe, that, m almost every case where by law a general devise of land is reduced to an estate for life, the intent of the testator is thwarted, for ordinary people do not distinguish between real and personal property The rule of law, however, is established and certain, that express words of limitation, or words tantamount, are necessary to pass an estate of inheritance." And he hence concluded that words tending to disinherit the heir at law, unless the estate is given to some one else, were not sufficient to prevent the heir from taking.
Lord Ellenborough m Roe v Daw followed the rule, and declared also that he thereby probably defeated the intention of the testator. It is a strange conclusion from the facts and needs the sanction of those great names to rescue it from even stronger characterization. Lord Mansfield spoke in 1781, Lord Ellenborough in 1815. We cannot believe, if called upon to interpret a will made in 1896, when the rights of heirs are not so insistent and the rule in their favor lingers, where it lingers at all, almost an anachronism, when ownership of real property is usually in fee, and when men's thoughts and speech and dealings are with the fee, they would hold that the purpose of a testator to disinherit his heirs could be translated into a remainder in fee after a devise of a life estate to another.
'But, perhaps, even the severe technicality of those cases need not be questioned. In the construction of wills we are not required to adhere rigidly to precedents. We said in Abbott et ux. v Essex Co., 18 How 202, 213
"If wills were always drawn by counsel learned in the law, it would be highly proper that courts should rigidly adhere to precedents, because every such instrument might justly be presumed to have been drawn with reference to them. But in a country where; from necessity or choice, every man acts as his own scrivener, his will is subject to be perverted by the application of rules of construction of which he was wholly ignorant."
To like effect is Cook et al. v Holmes et ux., 11 Massachusetts, 528, where the will passed on contluned the following devise:

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.

Opinion of the Court.

196 U. S.

"Item. To his grandson Gregory C., only child of his son Daniel C., deceased, a certain piece of land in Watertown, containing about six acres." The will contained devises to other sons of pieces of real estate, charging them with payment of certain legacies. The will concluded as follows: "The abovedescribed legacies, together with what I have heretofore done for my children and grandchildren, make them nearly equal, and are their full portions of my estate."
The will, therefore, is similar to the will in the case at bar. Equality between the devisees is as much the purpose of one as the other, though it is expressed m one and deduced as an implication in the other. Chief Justice Parker, m delivering the opinion of the court, said. "The quality of the estate which Gregory C. took by the devise must be determined by the words of the will, taken together, and receiving a liberal construction, to effectuate the intention of the testator, as manifested m the will."
Further- "The words of the particular devise to Gregory, considered by themselves, certainly give no inheritance." And stating the rule of law to be, as contrasted with the popular understanding, "that such a devise, standing alone, without any aid m the construction from other parts of the will, would amount only to an estate for life m the devisee," added.
"But it is too well established and known to require argument or authority now to support the position, that devises and legacies m a will may receive a character, by construction and comparison with other legacies and devises in the same will, different from the literal and direct effect of the words made use of in such devise, [Cases were cited in note] and this because the sole duty of the court, in giving a construction, is to ascertain the real intent and meaning of the testator; which can better be gathered by adverting to the whole scope of the provisions made by him for the objects of his bounty, than by confining their attention to one isolated paragraph, probably drawn up without a knowledge of technical words, or without recollecting the advantage of using them."

No. 125. Argued January 13,1905.-Decided February 20, 1905.
While the grant to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company under the act of July 2, 1864, was zn prmsenii, and took effect upon the sections granted when the road was definitely located, by relation as to the date of the grant, the survey of the land and the identification of the sectionswhether odd or even-is reserved to the Government, and the equitable title of the railroad company and its assigns becomes a legal title only upon the identification of the granted sections. Until the identification of the sections by a government survey the United States retains a special interest in the timber growing m the township sufficient to recover the value of timber cut and removed therefrom.
In a suit brought by the United States for that purpose private surveys made by the railroad company cannot be introduced as evidence to show that the land from which the timber was cut were odd sections within the grant and included m a conveyance from the railroad company to the defendants.

SIXTO v. SARRIA.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE DISTRICT OP PORTO RICO.
No. 40. Submitted November 3, 1904.-Decided January 3, 105.
Under the law of Porto Rico while an heir to an intestate may assert his rights against one already designated heir ab intestato any time within five years after the decree of designation, the heir so designated may within the five year period collect debts due to the intestate's estate and, where the payment is made in good faith and under the order of the court into which the money was paid by the debtor, and without notice of existence and claims of other heirs, discharge the debtor from liability, notwithstanding such other heirs subsequently assert their claims and are also designated as joint heirs ab zntestato.
Where, however, the debtor has legal notice from the court where the matter is pending that one not originally designated has asserted and is prosecuting a claim to recognition as an heir ab mntestato, any payments he makes to the one first designated are at his own peril and liability to account to the other heir after his claim has been established for his proportionate share, and the debtor is not protected by a decree and order of the court directing payment to the assignee of the heir originally designated in a proceeding to which such asserting heir was not a party.
Where the payment to the heir originally designated is made before the debt is due and after the other heir has asserted his claim, and under circumstances indicating collusion, it is for the jury to determine whether the payment was made in good faith and without knowledge of the rights of the asserting heir.
Tars is a writ of error bringing in review the proceedings of the District Court of the United States for the District of Porto Rico.
The original action was in assumpsit brought by Adolfo Sixto, an alien, and a subject of the King of Spain; against Laureano Sarria, a citizen of Porto Rico. The declaration set forth m substance.
That on November 27, 1892, the defendant was indebted to one Manuel Sixto, since deceased, m the sum of $16,000, Spanish money, with interest from May 15 of the same year, which sum said Sarria had promised to pay in four annual in-

stallments, falling due respectively on the fifteenth day of May of each and every year from 1893 until 1896, inclusive. That the said Manuel Sixto departed this life on November 27, 1892, leaving two children, plaintiff and one Maria Belen Sixto Melendez, as his heirs at law That as such heir the plaintiff was entitled to one-half of the indebtedness of $16,000, Spanish money, with interest at the rate of eight per cent from May 15, 1892. The declaration contained the usual averments in assumpsit of promise and default. The defendant filed a plea and amended plea to this declaration which set up the general issue, and for further plea averred
"And for a further and second plea to the said declaration, the defendant says that on the fifteenth day of May, eighteen hundred and ninety-two, the defendant became indebted m the sum of sixteen thousand dollars (16,000) Mexican dollars, money then current in Porto Rico, to one Manuel Sixto, on account of the purchase price of a farm situated in the island of Vieques, district of Porto Rico, and called 'Monte Santo'; that on the said fifteenth day of May, eighteen hundred and ninety-two, the defendant made and constituted a mortgage upon the said farm in favor of the said Sixto, as security for the payment of the aforesaid amount of sixteen thousand (16,000) Mexican dollars, together with a certain interest as stipulated in the said instrument of mortgage, that thereafter the said mortgage was duly registered in the registry of property of Humacao, Porto Rico, on the eleventh day of July, eighteen hundred and ninety-two, that the payment of the aforesaid sum of sixteen thousand (16,000) Mexican dollars, as provided for in the said instrument of mortgage, was to be made in the manner following, to wit. four thousand (4,000) dollars on the fifteenth day of May, eighteen hundred and ninety-three, and four thousand (4,000) dollars on the fifteenth day of May, of the years eighteen hundred and ninety-four, eighteen hundred and ninety-five, and eighteen hundred and nmety-six. And the defendant further says that the aforesaid Emanuel Sixto departed this life on the twenty-seventh day of

November, eighteen hundred and ninety-two, before any of the installments aforesaid had fallen due, that the said Sixto died intestate, and soon after his death, to wit, in the year eighteen hundred and ninety-three, judicial proceedings touching and respecting the settlement and inheritance of the estate of the said Manuel Sixto, deceased, and which said proceedings are known in the law of Porto Rico as 'proceedings ab zntestato,' were instituted in the court of first instance of Humacao, Porto Rico, the said court being then and there a court of record and of general jurisdiction, and the said court in said proceedings by a decree dated the fifteenth day of June, eighteen hundred and ninety-three, ordered the said defendant to pay into and deposit with the said court all sums of money then due by the said defendant to the said estate of the said Manuel Sixto, deceased, by virtue of the aforesaid mortgage, and the defendant thereupon and in obedience to the said order of the said court did on the twenty-second day of June, eighteen hundred and ninety-three, consign and deposit with the said court and did place at the disposal of the same the sum of four thousand (4,000) pesos of the money then current in Porto Rico, and the further suni of eight hundred twentytwo and fifty-two hundredths (822.52) dollars of the same kind of money, the first sum being the amount of the first installment due May fifteenth, eighteen hundred and ninety-three, and the second sum being the interest due on the aforesaid mortgage credit up to the first of June, eighteen hundred and ninety-three. And the said decree of the said court was duly entered before the commencement of this action and still is in full force and effect.
"And the defendant further says, as to the third installment above mentioned, that by judgment of the Supreme
Court of Porto Rico, then known as the 'audiencia territorial,' dated the eighteenth day of February, eighteen hundred and ninety-six, rendered and entered in certain foreclosure proceedings had before the said court on appeal from the court of first instance of Humacao, in which proceedings the

defendant and one Antonio Roig y Torruellas were plaintiffs, and which said proceedings the said Roig, as owner of the third and fourth installments of the mortgage before mentioned, sought to foreclose the same to the extent of the third installment aforesaid, together with certain interest, the defendant was found to be indebted to the said plaintiff, Roig, in the amount of the third installment aforesaid, together with the corresponding interest, and was ordered to pay the amount of said indebtedness so found due by the said judgment to the said Roig within the period of thirty days thereof, and the said judgment further provided for execution to issue upon the non-compliance with the terms thereof by the defendant. Said judgment was duly entered before the commencement of this suit and is still in force and effect. And the said defendant thereupon and in compliance with the said judgment of the said court thereafter paid unto the said plaintiff, Roig, the amounts ordered to be paid by the said judgment, to wit, the amount of the third installment of the aforesaid mortgage, together with the corresponding interest. And all of this the defendant is ready to verify"
The additional or amended plea sets forth. "And the defendant as to the second installment aforesaid says that he has paid the same, together with the corresponding interest, on the 4th day of April, 1894, to one Belen Sixto, who was then the record owner of said mortgage credit, and who had previously been declared heir ab tnlestato of said Manuel Sixto, deceased, by the order and decree of the proper court, to wit, the court of the first instance of Humacao, respectively on the 21st and 23d of the month of November, 1893. "And as to the third and fourth installments the defendant says that on the 11th day of September, 1894, the aforesaid Belen Sixto, for a valuable consideration, ceded and transferred the said two installments to one Antonio Roig y Torruellas; that thereupon the said transfer was duly recorded and the said two installments appeared upon the record to

be the property of the said Roig, and thereupon, to wit, on or about the 16th day of May, 1896, the defendant paid the said Roig the amount of said two installments, together with all interest due."
The bill of exceptions brings into the case the testimony and the rulings and charge of the court. The facts developed are: Manuel Sixto sold a farm to the defendant Sarria for $16,000 Mexican money, payable in four equal installments with interest. A mortgage was taken upon the property to secure the payment of the purchase price. Manuel Sixto y Andino died November 27, 1892, leaving no issue except two natural children, a daughter by the name of Maria Belen Sixto y Melendez (hereafter called Maria Belen), who lived in Vieques, and the plaintiff in error, a son, who lived in the island of St. Thomas. After the death of Manuel Sixto, the daughter, Maria Belen, filed her petition in the court of first instance of Humacao, Porto Rico, allegmg that she was the only heir of Manuel Sixto, deceased, and praying the court to declare her heir ab mntestato according to the provisions of section 980, and following, of the Code of Porto Rico then in force. Upon June 22, 1893, the defendant in error, Sarma, paid into court, where the petition of Maria Belen was then pending, the first installment due, with interest. On November 21, 1893, Maria Belen, by decree of the court, was adjudged heir ab mntestato of Manuel Sixto, without prejudice to the rights of third parties. On the twenty-fifth of the same month the assets received by the administrator of Manuel Sixto, who had been appointed during the proceeding, and the money paid into court by defendant in error, by order of the court were made over to Maria Belen as sole heir ab sntestato. On November 24, 1893, the plaintiff m error, Adolfo Sixto, presented to the same court of first instance his petition to be declared the heir of Manuel Sixto, deceased (jointly entitled with Maria Belen), invoking the exercise by the court of "voluntary jurisdiction" under the section of the code whereby Maria Belen had been adjudged heir. To

this petition Maria Belen answered, alleging that she had been duly declared the only heir of Manuel Sixto, and that the plaintiff in error could only contest her right by a "contentious suit" (expediente contenstoso).
The court sustained this contention, and Sixto appealed, but later abandoned the appeal, and on April 4, 1894, began a suit in the form of a contentious proceeding, making Maria Belen a party defendant, and praying the court to declare him (Adolfo Sixto) an equal heir with her in the estate of Manuel Sixto, and asking the court to issue an order to the registrar of property, requiring him to make a cautionary entry m the register concerning the property affected by this suit, and also requiring the defendant in error to retain, at the disposition of the court, the sums still owing to the estate of Manuel Sixto. On June 2, 1894, a notice was accordingly issued to Sarria and one to the registrar. The one to Sarma was issued on June 5, 1894, and the one to the registrar on June 4, 1894. The defendant, Maria Belen, being notified of these orders, on June 26, 1894, answered the plaintiff's petition, and in her answer prayed that the interlocutory order of June 2, 1894, be vacated and the notices canceled. On
August 30, 1894, the prayer of defendant's answer was granted by the court, and orders issued accordingly to the registrar and to Sarria, and notice was given to the solicitor of the plaintiff. On September 1, 1894, the order reached the registrar, and the order of cancellation was made on the books on September 3, 1894. On September 3, 1894, the plaintiff filed a petition for an appeal from the court's order of August 30, 1894, praying that it be allowed "in both effects," that is, (Code, sec. 383), with the effect of a review and stay of proceedings, but the judge granted the same with one effect only, that is, for a review of the judgment. In the appellate court, on November 17, 1894, that court held that the allowance of both effects had been wrongfully denied, and ordered that the appeal be considered as having been taken for both effects. On December 22, 1894, the appellate court granted a further

Statement of the Case.

order, that Sarria, the defendant m error, be notified of his obligation under the decree of June 2, 1894, which order was accordingly issued. On November 29, 1895, the appellate court (audiencia) rendered its decision on the merits of the appeal, and reversed the order of August 30, 1894, and reaffirmed the order of June 2, 1894, m its validity and regularity The court used the following language:
"That which was ordered m the decree appealed from regarding Mr. Laureano Sarra is hereby set aside, leaving in force the requisition ordered and directed to said Sarria on June 2 by the judge of first instance until the resolution of the pending appeal."
This decision was certified to the court below in January, 1896, and in March following the solicitor of the plaintiff requested the court to notify Sarria and the registrar that the order of June 2, 1894, was still m force, which was accordingly done, and the defendant in error made reply thereto as follows:
" Having received notice that the installment of the mortgage had been transferred to Mr. Antonio Roig, who has recorded said transfer in the registry of property, and supposing that he will proceed to collect the same judicially as he did the previous installment, he is unable to accept the notification, and he will appear before the audiencia in the premises."
The registrar refused to comply with the order for these reasons: "First, because subsequent to the illegal cancellation of the cautionary notice the property as well as the encumbrance had been transferred on the registry; and, second, because the mortgage law contained no provision regarding the form of carrying into effect such an order." Thereafter the plaintiff asked the court for a further order to the registrar,
but this was denied. The case proceeded to proof and argument, and on Decem-
ber 15, 1896, a final decision was rendered, adverse to the plaintiff, from which decree he took an appeal, which was allowed "in both effects." The appeal was also allowed from

the order denying a further order to the registrar. On February 2, 1897, the appellate court consolidated the appeals and ordered the suspension of further proceedings until final decision.
In the meantime, on April 26, 1896, by an order of the court of the first instance, Sarria was allowed to withdraw his deposit of the third installment. The order recited that one Roig had become the purchaser from Maria Belen of the third and fourth installments, and had recovered judgment in the audiencia against Sarria for the third installment, found that Maria Belen had the right to transfer these installments, and ordered a copy of the decree to be placed in the records by the actuary
Thus the matter remained until after the conclusion of the war with Spain, resulting in a change of sovereignty of Porto Rico.
By the military government, an order was issued abolishmg the territorial audiencia, the appellate court aforesaid, creating in its place the District Court of San Juan. On September 29, 1899, that court rendered its final decision upon both appeals, reversing the action of the court below, and deciding the plaintiff to be legally proved the heir of Manuel Sixto. The trial in the United States District Court in the present suit resulted in a verdict and judgment for the defendant.

MR. JusTIcE DAY, after making the foregoing statement of facts, delivered the opinion of the court.

It is evident from the foregoing statement of facts that the controversy, as it appeared in the United States District Court, was resolved into the question whether Adolfo Sixto, who had been duly adjudged the co-heir with Maria Belen of Manuel

SIXTO v. SARRIA.

196 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Sixto, deceased, was entitled to recover one-half of the amount due on the mortgage debt which the defendant Sarria claimed to have discharged by legal payments. The recovery sought was for one-half of the four installments of purchase money due respectively on the fifteenth day of May m the years from 1893 until 1896, inclusive. The defendant interposed different defenses to different installments of the debt. We will proceed to consider them, together with the charge and rulings of the court concerning the same.
Referring to the first and second installments, we find it to be the contention of the plaintiff in error that Maria Belen, having been adjudged heir ab tntestato under a decree which expressly reserved the rights of third parties, no payment could have been lawfully made to her as against the rights of the plaintiff in error, and that if any such payment was made it was subject to the risk that the subsequent established rights of the plaintiff m error might entitle him to recover from Sarria one-half of such payments. Upon this subject the court charged the jury-
"On February 15, 1894, she [Maria Belen] having been declared the heir, the entry was made of that fact m the registry (of property). I say to you as a matter of law, that that declaration of her heirship was without prejudice to the rights of third parties-and that meant that if any other person showed himself afterwards to be an heir he was entitled to a proper proportion of the estate, but so far as a collection of debts, and so far as a proper attention to the assets were concerned and the control of them, she became entitled to attend to that."
Upon the same subject the plaintiff in error had requested the court to charge.
"As the ex parte decree declaring Belen Sixto the heir of Manuel Sixto expressly saved the rights of third parties, that was notice to the defendant that any payment made to her was made at his peril as against the other true heirs; and, as. defendant was not required by any legal authority to pay the

196 U. S.

first two payments to Belen Sixto, and as the plaintiff is
shown in truth to have been an equal heir with Belen Sixto, the plaintiff is entitled to recover one-half of those two pay-
ments." So far as this contention is concerned, we think the court
below was right. The sections of the Code of Porto Rico (War Department translation), under which Maria Belen was declared the heir ab mntestato of Manuel Sixto, are as follows:
"976. After the measures indispensable for the security of the property prescribed in the foregoing section have been taken, and without prejudice to including in the same proceedings the making of the inventory, the designation of heirs ab ntestato shall be proceeded with in a separate record.
"977 This designation may also be made at the instance of the interested parties, without the necessity of previously taking the steps mentioned, m cases in which they are not necessary and in which the institution of intestate proceedings is not requested.
" 978. Heirs ab ntestato, who are descendants of the deceased, may obtain a declaration of their rights by proving, with the proper documents or with the evidence obtainable, the death of the person whose estate is in question, their relationship to the same, and with the evidence of witnesses that said person died intestate, and that they, or the persons whom they designate, are his only heirs.
"The services of a solicitor or attorney are not necessary m order to present this claim.
"979. The deputy public prosecutor shall be cited to appear at said proceeding, to whom the record shall afterward be referred for the period of six days for his report thereon.
"Should he find the proof insufficient, a hearing shall be granted to the interested parties in order that they may cure the defect.
"When the deputy public prosecutor requests it, or the judge considers it necessary, the documents presented shall be compared with the originals.

SIXTO v. SARRIA.

196 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

"980. When the foregoing steps have been taken. the judge shall, without further proceedings, make a ruling designating the heirs ab sntestato should he deem it proper, or he may refuse to make such declaration, reserving the rights of the claimants to institute an ordinary action. This ruling may be appealed from both for review and a stay of proceedings.
"1000. After the declaration of heirs ab 'ntestato has been made, by a final judgment or ruling, the proceedings shall be continued according to the procedure prescribed for testamentary proceedings.
"1001. The judge shall order that there be delivered to the heirs instituted all the property, books, and papers of the intestate, and that the administrator render an account of his administration to them, the judicial intervention ceasing."
It is argued that this appointment of the heir ab zntestato is subject to the limitation that the rights of the heir are not fixed until five years have elapsed from the date of the designation by the court proceedings, and in support of this contention certain articles of the Mortgage Law of Porto Rico are cited.
"2. In the registries mentioned in the preceding article shall
be recorded. "1. Instruments transferring or declaring ownership of
realty, or of property rights thereto. "2. Instruments by which rights of use, use and occupancy,
emphyteusis, mortgage, annuity, servitudes, and any others by which states are created, acknowledged modified or extinguished.
"23. The instruments mentioned m articles 2 and 5, which are not duly recorded or entered in the registry, cannot prejudice third persons.
"The record of real property and property rights, acquired
through an inheritance or legacy, shall not prejudice third persons until five years have elapsed since the date thereof, excepting m cases of testate or intestate inheritances, legacies and additions thereto, when left to legal heirs.
"381. Property acquired through inheritance or legacy can-

not be cleared until five years have elapsed from the date of
their record in the registry" But we think this limitation of five years was intended to
permit such heirs at law or parties beneficially interested in the estate to assert their rights as against the heir and the property in his hands, and to prevent its transfer except sub3ect to the right of such persons to assert their claims within the permitted limitation. We are here dealing with the right to collect the assets, and the Code provides, sees. 1000, 1001, that after the designation of the heir or heirs ab 'intestatoby a final judgment or ruling of the court the proceedings shall be continued according to the procedure prescribed for testamentary proceedings, and the judge may order that all the property, books and papers of the intestate be turned over to the heirs, and that the administrator render his account of his administration of the estate, and thereupon judicial intervention shall cease. It seems to us manifest that the effect of these proceedings is to permit the heir ab sntestato, after such final decision, to receive and collect the estate. It may be that others will establish an interest in the property for which the heir will have to respond, and it is specially provided that, for the purpose of transfer, property shall not be deemed clear until after five years have elapsed. But this does not require that the collection of debts shall be delayed for a like period or that they shall be paid to the legally declared heir or heirs, upon pain of being required to respond to others who may within the limitation permitted establish a right to the property Such construction would seem to be unreasonable, and we are cited to no authority that goes to that extent. It is opposed to the practice of the civil law upon which the Code of Porto Rico is based, in which system the heir by intestacy corresponded with the common law administrator, except that the Roman heir was entitled to administer both the real and personal estate. Story on Conflict of laws, §508.
In the present case the first installment was due on May 15,

Opinion of the Court.

1893, and was paid into court of first instance according to its order and a receipt given therefor under the seal of the court on June 22, 1893. This was done before any proceedings were instituted by the plaintiff m error. The payment was made under the order of the court, and we see no reason why the defendant in error should not be discharged thereby
As to the second installment, other considerations apply Sarria testified that while this installment fell due on May 15, 1894, he paid the same on April 1, 1894, to Maria Belen, winch payment, he says, was solenmzed by a notarial act duly acknowledged. As to this payment, the court in its charge took the view that the contentious suit of Adolfo Sixto was not commenced until April 4, 1894, of which fact Sarria was not notified until June 5, 1894, and therefore Maria Belen had the right to collect this payment. The suit of April 4, 1894, was the one begun by Adolfo Sixto after the decision against him in the court of first instance, holding that he could only contest the right of Maria Belen by a contentious proceeding, from which the plaintiff in error took an appeal, but abandoned the same, and on April 4, 1894, amended the suit to a contentious proceeding, making Maria Belen a party defendant, and seeking for an order to the registrar to make a cautionary order touching the property in controversy, and also an order to the defendant in error reqiring him to retain at the disposition of the court whatever sums he owed to the estate of Manuel Sixto, deceased. On the day of the beginning of this contentious suit, Sarria paid to Maria Belen, anticipating the maturity of the installment by more than a month, the amount winch would have fallen due on the fifteenth day of May following.
We think that, in view of the testimony produced, the validity of this payment should have been submitted to the jury under proper instructions. The plaintiff testified that he was known to the defendant, and that the latter was well aware that he was a son of Manuel Sixto, deceased. The proceeding to declare his rights had been begun. It is evident

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.

196 U. S.

from a letter written to him on November 11, 1892, by Maria Belen, that she recognized the plaintiff in error as her brother, for m this letter she announces the death of "our beloved father," subscribed herself as "sister," and requests Sixto to come over to Vieques at once, as his presence was necessary m order to collect money coming from the estate. Under these circumstances, the question of whether Sarria had notice of the plaintiff in error's rights and demands, and whether this was a valid payment, or was made in anticipation of the possible claims of Adolfo Sixto, with intent to deprive hun of his rights, should have been left to the jury, instead of the instruction given which practically required a finding for the defendant m error.
As to the third and fourth installments, the defendant claims to have paid these to one Roig. It appears that these alleged payments to Roig were evidenced by certain notarial instruments, which became of record m the office of the registrar of deeds, and, as is recited in that record, Roig appears to have been the declared purchaser of the third and fourth installment by assignment from Maria Belen, and the court of first instance, on April 25, 1896, at the instance of Sarria, permitted him to withdraw the third installment, and declared IRoig entitled to collect the third and fourth installments. Upon this subject the court charged the jury"
"In this contentious suit by Adolfo Sixto against Belen, this defendant, Sarria, was ordered on June 2, 1894, to pay into court whatever money he might be owing. That order was served on Sarria on June 5, 1894, and afterwards that court decided that Sixto, the plaintiff in this suit, was not entitled to attach this money He obtained an appeal from that judgment, but not from that portion of it that canceled the annotation made in the registry of deeds of the attachment of that fund. Subsequently, on November 17, 1894, an appeal was allowed in the upper court from that portion of it, but no notice was given as to Sarria, who was merely a garnishee in the suit, and who had received no notice not to pay over

the money until the lower court decided whether he had the right to pay it over. Between the time the court decided the attachment and the time the appeal was allowed in the upper court, Belen Sixto assigned to Roig the third and fourth installments. I say to you, as a matter of law, that there was nothing to hinder her from doing that at that time, she had, in law, the right to do it."
The counsel for the plaintiff requested the court, upon the same subject, to charge.
"As it is shown by the uncontradicted evidence that the judge of the court of first instance of Humacao was entirely without authority or jurisdiction to issue his order on August 30, 1894, directing the registrar to make annotation on his books of said order, said order to the registrar was void and the annotation made by the registrar was void, and the former annotation remained in force, which was notice to all the world, including this-defendant, that the plaintiff had an interest in those payments such as might be declared by the court, and the court having afterwards decided that the plaintiff here is entitled to a one-half interest in said estate, the plaintiff is now entitled to recover one-half of the last two payments, with interest."
It appears that Adolfo Sixto was not a party to the suit between Roig and Sarria, in which it is declared that Roig was held entitled to recover the third installment, and if Sarria had notice of the pendency of the suit to establish the rights of Adolfo Sixto in such wise as to be bound by the result thereof, he could not prevent Sixto's recovering an interest in the property by wrongfully paying it over in the proceedings to which the plaintiff in error was not a party The court below seems to have given its charge upon this subject upon the theory that the order of August 30, 1894, was not appealed from in such wise as to prevent Sarria from paying the third and fourth installments to the assignee Roig, and it is said that he was merely a garnishee in the suit, and had then received no notice not to pay over the money

until the lower court had decided whether he had the right to pay it over. The payment of the third and fourth installments was made to Roig by permitting Sarria, in the court of first instance, to withdraw the installment which he had paid into court under the order of June 2, 1894. These installments were paid to Roig on May 16, 1896, but in the attitude of the suit then pending to establish the rights of Adolfo Sixto, and Sarria's knowledge thereof, could the latter legally make these payments so as to conclude the rights of the plaintiff in error ? It is true that the lower court on August 30, 1894, had held in favor of Maria Belen, vacating the notice sent to Sarria and the cautionary notices to the registrar, and the plaintiff in error had prayed an appeal "in both effects," 7..e., for a review of the order and a stay of proceedings, but was refused an appeal in the latter aspect, from which refusal he also appealed, and this was the attitude of the case at the time of the alleged purchase by Roig on September 11, 1894. On November 17, 1894, the audiencia considered the application of Sixto for the enlargement of the appeal, and held that such allowance was wrongfully denied in the lower court, and ordered that the appeal be " considered as having been taken for both effects." On January 8, 1895, Sarria was notified of this order, and appeared and asked that a clear and detailed statement be given him "as to what he was to comply with." Thereupon a new explanatory order was directed to Sarria, informing him that the previous requisition meant the ratification of the one previously directed to him by the court, "in order that the sums which he owed from that time to Mr. Manuel Sixto should not be delivered by him except to the court in order to deposit the same in the royal treasury" This order was duly served on Sarria on February 5, 1895.
On November 29, 1895, the audiencia heard the appeal, and, reversing the order of August 30, declared the order of June 2, 1894, in full force, whereby the cautionary entry was ordered to be made by the registrar of property, and the notification

196 U. S.

ordered to Sarria to hold the payments on the mortgage or pay the same into the treasury, to abide the order of the court.
The registrar refused to comply, assigning as a reason that the encumbrance had been assigned to third parties and that the mortgage law did not justify such an order. Subsequent proceedings resulted in the final decree of the military court deciding the merits of the controversy in favor of Sixto. The decision of November 29, 1895, was also notified to Sarria, and on May 4, 1896, the entry of the court discloses:
"On May 4, 1896, appeared Mr. Laureano Sarria y Gonzalez and stated. that, having received notice that the installment of the mortgage had been transferred to Mr. Antonio Roig, who has recorded said transfer in the registry of property, and supposing that he will proceed to collect the same judicially, as he did the previous installment, he is unable to accept the notification, and he will appear before the audiencia in the premises."
Over the objection of the plaintiff in error, Sarria was permitted to testify that he paid the installment to Roig by order of the audienca. But the plaintiff in error was not a party to such proceeding, if it had been legally proved, and of course could not be concluded by it. On being notified that the order of June 2, 1894, was in full force, requiring him to hold the funds, while Sarria says he is unable to accept the notification, he declares "he will appear before the audiencia m the premises." Instead of so doing, unless the appearance in the Roig case can be so considered, he made application in the court of first instance for a release of the deposited installment in oraer to pay it to Roig, and that court made the order, although it had been notified of the decision of the audi-
encia of November 29, 1895. This order could have no effect on the rights of the plaintiff in error, nor can it protect Sarria, who acted in the face of knowledge of the decision of the higher court instead of appearing in that court at the suit of Sixto, and having the rights of Roig and the contesting heirs determined. We conclude that the plaintiff in error had the right to recover his share of the third and fourth installments,

FULLERTON v. TEXAS.
ERROR TO THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS.
No. 112. Argued December 16, 190.-Decided January 9,1905.
It is too late to raise a Federal question by petition for rehearing in the Supreme Court of a State after that court has pronounced its final decision unless it appears that the court entertained the petition and disposed of the question.
The certificate of the presiding judge of the Supreme Court of the State, made after the decision, to the effect that a Federal question was considered and decided adversely to plaintiff in error, cannot in itself confer junsdiction on this court; and on the face of this record and from the opinions the reasonable inference is that the application for rehearing may have been denied in the mere exercise of discretion, or the alleged constitutional question was not passed on in terms because not suggested until too late.
THE facts are stated in the opinion.

UTERMEHLE v. NORMENT.
ERROR TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
No. 63. Argued November 2$, 29, 1904.-Decided February 20, 1905.
Mere ignorance of the law standing, alone does not constitute any defense against its enforcement, and a mistake of law, pure and simple, without the addition of any circumstances of fraud or misrepresentation constitutes no basis for relief at law or in equity and forms no excuse in favor of the party asserting that he made the mistake.
The rule of law is that a party taking a benefit of a provision in his favor under a will is estopped from attacking the validity of the instrument; and where an heir at law has taken a benefit under the will, acquiesced in its validity for many years, permitted the legatees and devisees to act upon such consent and acquiescence, has so changed his position on that account that he cannot be restored to it, and meanwhile witnesses have died, this estoppel is not affected because he was at the time ignorant of this rule of law.
THE plaintiff in error seeks by this writ to review the judgment of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia (not yet reported), affirming the decree of the Supreme Court of that District, sitting as a court of probate, admitting the will of George W. Utermehle to probate as a will of real estate, by virtue of the jurisdiction conferred upon the court by the act of Congress of June 8, 1898. 30 Stat. 434. The same will had been admitted to probate in the District in the year 1889 as a will of personalty (which was all the jurisdiction at that time possessed by the court), with the concurrence and consent of the plaintiff in error. The facts upon which the case hinges are in substance the following:
George W. Utermehle, the testator, died in the city of Washington on the sixteenth day of April, 1889, leaving a large amount of real and personal property, the real estate amounting, as is said, to about a million dollars, and the personalty to between six hundred thousand and a million of dollars. He left a will, bearing date December 7, 1887, which

UTERMEHLE v. NORMENT.

Statement of the Case.

appeared on its face to have been duly executed for the con-
veyance of real estate. The testator left him surviving his
widow, two daughters-Mrs. Taylor and Mrs. Norment-and
the plaintiff in error, his grandson, the son of his -deceased son, as his sole heirs at law and next of kin. The widow was named executrix of the will, and she propounded the same for probate
April 26, 1889. It was duly admitted to probate on that day, on the petition of the widow, as executrix, with the written
consent of the daughters and the plaintiff in error. The executrix gave a bond in the sum of $20,000 for the payment of all just debts and claims against the deceased and for the payment of the legacies bequeathed by the will, and letters were issued to her. She duly administered upon the estate,
paid the funeral expenses and other charges, and the legacies mentioned in the will, including that to the plaintiff in error. She filed no inventory but made a statement of account on
the fourteenth day of May, 1890. The personal property, except such as was otherwise disposed of under the will, and in payment of debts and legacies, she retained for herself, as sole and absolute owner, in accordance with the terms of the will. Of this -amount it is said that she thereafter disposed of a large part in charities. By the will of. George W. Utermehle, he bequeathed to each of his three nieces, residing in Germany, the sum of three thousand dollars; he devised to his grandson, the plaihtiff in error, the property known as the Young Law Building in Washington; he also bequeathed' to him the interest due or to become due on a note for $750, secured on a lot in Washington, and also the principal of the same; he bequeathed to his wife, Sarah Utermehle, all the rest of his personal property, of every kind, to be taken by her in lieu of dower, and to be disposed of by her by deed,, will or otherwise, as she pleased; he devised to her his then present residence and the property adjoining, being square 765 in the city of Washington; he then bequeathed all the rest and residue of his real estate wherever situated, and all the real estate of which he might die seized and possessed, other than

that already devised, to his two daughters, Mamie Norment and Rosa Taylor, as tenants in common, share and share alike; he appointed his wife sole executrix of his will and revoked all other wills theretofore made by him; he suggested that, as he had no debts and his personal estate was to go to his wife, a very moderate bond should be required of her as executrix.
After the death of his grandfather the plaintiff was present
at his late residence and heard this will read. Immediately after the reading of the will he left the house,
but Mrs. Taylor, one of his aunts, as he was leaving, asked him to come over the next day, which he did. He testified on this trial that he arrived at the house and went into the (lining room, and Mrs. Taylor, Mrs. Norment and his grandmother were there. Mrs. Taylor did the talking, and started the conversation by stating to the plaintiff in error that the will had virtually cut him off, and that if it had not been for her and the Doctor (her husband) the plaintiff in error would not have been left the property called the Young Law Building, but that they had had his grandfather paint it up and put it into repair, so that when it came into his possession it would not be any expense to him to put it in condition at the time. She further said that his grandmother was left all the personal property, which amounted to almost, if not quite as much as that which they (his aunts) would receive under the will, and that when his grandmother died she proposed to make him right, to make him equal with them by equalizing his share; that his grandmother wanted to know what the mortgage on his farm was, as she understood that there was a mortgage; that she wanted to pay it off; that she wanted to start him off without any debts on him. His grandmother was sitting there at the time but said nothing. He was asked what the-mortgage was on his farm. He told them $11,500. The only remarks made were those between Mrs. Taylor (his aunt) and himself, and the only statement he made was what the mortgage on the farm was. He also testified on the trial

below that he believed that what was then promised him, as to what his grandmother would do when she made her will; that he had no doubt whatever that she would fulfill her promise. His grandmother told him at that interview she would give him a check for the mortgage in a few days, and he then went home. Subsequently aad on the twenty-sixth day of April, 1889, he signed the consent to the probate of the will. He did it in reliance, as he said, upon the promise above men-
tioned.
From the time of the probate of his grandfather's Will up to the time of the death of his grandmother, he did nothing to attack the will of his grandfather, but relied upon the promise made by or on the part of his grandmother, the day after the funeral. After the probate of his grandfather's will he received from his grandmother, as the executrix, the legacy spoken of therein, and gave receipt therefor; he also took possession of the real estate given him by the will, called Young's Law Building, and received the rents therefor for nearly two years, and (on March 24, 1891) sold it for $20,000, and kept the proceeds. The sisters took the real estate devised to them by the will. They commenced an action of partition and the real estate was partitioned between them, and each thereafter treated the real estate set off to her under the partition as her own absolute property. Sonic of it they conveyed and disposed of so that it passed beyond their control. They assumed and supposed that the real estate given to them in the will was their own, as the plaintiff in error had consented to the probate of the. will, and had made no objections whatever since that time to its validity, or questioned it in any way.
On the thirteenth of March, 1893, the grandmother died, leaving a will dated July 5, 1889, less than three months after the promise alleged to have been made by her, or in her behalf, to the plaintiff in error immediately after the funeral of his grandfather. The will of the grandmother was admitted to probate, by the consent of all the parties interested, on the

seventeenth day of March, 1893. The two daughters were
executrices under the will, but, on objection being made by the plaintiff in error to their receiving commissions, lhey waived their right to them, and performed the services without pay. By the terms of this will the two aunts and the plaintiff in error were made to share equally in the estate of the grandmother, which turned out to amount to something over $200,'000, the grandmother having, during her lifetime, as is stated, disposed of a large amount of the personal property bequeathed to her under the, will of her husband, in charities. When the terms of the will of the grandmother were read to the plaintiff in error he testified on the trial below that he then said, "So far as I am concerned I have got the worst of and I have got .to stand it. I never made but one .mistake in my lif, and that was when I held still once before,
and now I have ,to stand still." He received undqr the will of his grandmother $84,256.87,
being the same share as was received by each of his aunts. He received, under the will of his grandfather and that of his grandmother a total of between $140,000 and $150,000. After the death of his grandmother he took no steps showing an intention to contest the will of either, until May 19, 1900, which was ten years after the settlement of the estate of his grandfather and nearly seven years after the settlement of the estate of his -grandmother. Oi the date named he addressed two letters of the same tenor, one to Mrs. Taylor and the other to Mrs. Norment, in which he states that he had been under a misapprehension and was ignorant regarding his rights at the time his grandfather died, and that misrepresentations had been made to him from those. interested, touching his rights and interest in his grandfather's estate, and he therefore notifled them*that he denied the validity of the paper writing alleged to be the last will and testament of his grandfather, which had been admitted to probate as a will of personal property, and stated that he contended that the alleged will had never been operative in connection with the real property,

and that his claim to the building and ground known as *Young's Law Building was merely a one-third interest in the property as tenant in common with the other heirs at law of his deceased grandfather; he also stated that he held himself ready to account, upon demand, to his two aunts for the onethird interest to which each was entitled in that real estate, as two of the heirs at law of his grandfather, in both the property, and the rents and profits from the same from his grandfather's .death; that he held himself as ready, upon demand, to make proper settlement with both of his aunts for the $750 note, -with the accrued interest thereon, which had been all paid, and was pretended to hive been bequeathed to him under the will of his grandfather. Plaintiff in error. testified that he did not receive any answer to either letter, nor any communication from either of his aunts, and soon thereafter he instituted a suit in ejectment, and on June 9, 1900, filed a caveat in the Probate Court against the validity of the will, as a will of personalty. The plaintiff in error there charged that the will was procured by the fraud, undue in·fluence and duress of Mrs. Taylor and her husband, and that the testator had no testamentary capacity when the paper was signed by him. Mrs. Taylor and Mrs. Norment answered this caveat, and at the same time filed a petition asking for probate of the will of their father, of December 7, 1887, as a will of real estate, under the act of Congress of June 8, 1898, above mentioned. To this petition the plaintiff in error made
answer. Pending proceedings in the Probate Court on this caveat of
the plaintiff in error, and the petition for the probate of the will as one of real estate, Mrs. Taylor, one of the aunts, died, January 22, 1901, leaving a will by which she devised all of her estate and property to her husband, subject to an annuity to her son, and nominated her husband as executor. This will was duly admitted to probate on the eighteenth day of March, 1901, and letters testamentary were issued to Dr. Taylor (the husbanid). Thereupon he filed his petition in these

proceedings, wherein he stated that the property devised and bequeathed to him by his wife was in fact to be held in trust by him for the benefit of his son and his children, with the reservation of certain rights and powers for himself, and he asked that the parties named by him be made parties to the 'present proceedings in place of Mrs. Taylor, and they were
accordingly made such.
The court then determined that issues should be formulated between the parties, to be tried in the Probate Court with a jury, under the act of June 8, '1898, and there were six issues thug drawn: The first was in regard to the question whether the plaintiff in error was estopped to deny the validity of his grandfather's will as a will of personal property; the second, 'whether he was estopped to deny its validity as one disposing of real property; third, was a question as to the testamentary capacity of the grandfather; the fourth, whether there was undue influence; fifth, whether there was fraud in obtaining the will from the grandfather; and sixth, whether there was
duress.
It was stipulated that the question of the application of.the
statute of limitations, which was raised by the caveat and petitions, and all other questions, should be reserved for future
determination by the court. Charles H. Utertmheehloethweraspamrtaidees plaintiff for the purpose of the trial, and all were made defendants On March 17, 1902, a jury was impanneled and the trial commenced. The plaintiff proceeded
to give his testimony, addressed to the question of estoppel and to an explanation of his delay in asserting his alleged rights. When the counsel for plaintiff ifi error announced their testimony on the question of estoppel closed, they were about, to proceed with their testimony on the other issues, but counsel for the defendants objected, and asked the court to direct a verdict against the plaintiff on the issue of estoppel, and against the plaintiff upon all the other issues. After consideration the court instructed the jury to render a verdict against the plaintiff on each and all the issues, and a yerdict

was thus rendered and recorded. Thereupon an order or
decree was rendered affirming the decree of April 26, 1889, admitting the grandfather's will to probate as and for a will of personalty, and also admitting it now to probate as and for a will of real estate under the act of Congress of 1898. The Court of Appeals having affirmed this decree, the case has come to us by writ of error on the part of plaintiff.

Mr. D. W. Baker and Mr. Wilton J. Lambert for plaintiff
in error:
Devisees cannot invoke the doctrine of estoppel who are charged with exercising undue influence or fraud in the making of the will, and in making false and fraudulent misrepresentations to prevent the plaintiff in error from investigating the facts surrounding the making of the will, this last fraud being merely ancillary to the principal fraud charged.

The caveator is to be charged not only with what he actually knew in regard to the physical and mental condition of his grandfather and the alleged undue influence, coercion, misrepresentation and fraud, but with the knowledge he could have acquired by the use of reasonable diligence-especially as to matters concerning which what he did know would have led a man of ordinary prudence to make further inquiry.

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.

Opinion of the Court.

197 U. S.

MR. JUSTICE PECKHAM, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court.

It is true that the plaintiff in error has received out of the estates of his grandfather and grandmother only between the sum of $140,000 and $150,000, while an equal division of the estate of his grandfather, between himself and his aunts, would have given him a much larger sum. What was the reason, if any, for this discrimination, the record does not
show. When the will of his grandfather was read the plaintiff in
error was perfectly aware of its contents. He was a young man, nearly twenty-four years of age, married, and there is no proof that he was not of ordinary intelligence and capacity. There is no pretense in the evidence that there was any fraud or misrepresentation connected with obtaining his consent to the probate of the will, without opposition or contest on his part. By his own statement he understood distinctly from one of his aunts, after the reading of the will, that it substantially cut him off; that he would receive under the will a devise of the Young Law Building, worth about $20,000, and a bequest of the note of $750 and accrued interest, amounting to not quite $3,000, and that that was all that was given him
under the will. He knew it when the will was read. There is not a particle of evidence that he did not know that, if there had been fraud or undue influence or duress in obtaining the alleged will from his grandfather, or if the latter was without testamentary capacity, such will would be void. -The trial court, indeed, observed that he admitted he knew what his legal rights were at the time of the death of his 'grandfather, if there were no will. He was ignorant only of any evidence on which to base a contest against the proof of the will. He says he did not know at .that time that fraud or undue influence or duress had been exercised, in order to obtain the
will, nor did he know that his grandfather lacked testamentary capacity to execute a will, but there is no evidence whatever

UTERMEHLE v. NORMENT.

Opinion of the Court.

that any means were used or representation made to prevent him from ascertaining what the facts really were. The reason for his not contesting was, as he said, his reliance on the promise alleged to have been made by or on behalf of.his grandmother to make him equal lby her own will. On account of this promise he did not contest the will. By reason of his consent, his aunts, the other heirs at law of his grandfather, proceeded to make partition of the real estate given to them by the will, and to use, convey and dispose of it as if it were absolutely their own property. lis grandmother received the personal property bequeathed to her by the will and disposed of large amounts of it -prior to her death by gifts to charity and otherwise. It would be impossible to place the other heirs in the same position that they were in at the time of the death of the grandfather. The two aunts, if that will had not been proved, would have receivedtheir share of the personalty instead of almost the whole of it going to the mother. Under the will, however, the mother took the personalty and spent or disposed of large portions of it, so that she died possessed of only about $200,000, and the two aunts and the plaintiff in error have received an equal share of that sum. The aunts would have received a much larger share of the personalty had it not been for the will of their father. As is stated by the Court of Appeals in the opinion delivered in this case:
"It is impossible to tell from the record before us whether they (the aunts of plaintiff in errdr) fared any better with the will than they would have fared without it; but it is very evident that by the bequest of the entire'personalty by the will to their mother, they lost a valuable interest to which they cannot now be restored. It is'impossible to restore the original situation, and the attempt to do so would be to wantonly question titles that have long since accrued, including the very title which the caveator has himself disposed of to the Young Law Building."
Of the witnesses to the grandfather's will, two are dead

and the third paralyzed. From the date of the probate of the grandfather's will in April, 1889, down to nineteenth of May, 1900, the plaintiff in error took no steps towards a contest. On that date he wrote the letters to his aunts, above referred to; and therein he says that misrepresentations were made to him as to his rights and interest in the estate. We find a total absence of all. proof as to any such misrepresentations, either as to his rights or his interest in the estate of his grandfather. The trial court also found that the plaintiff in error had not exhibited even reasonable diligence to learn any facts as to the w.ill.,of his grandfather, and that his alleged ignorance of the, law, was the only excuse which had the semblance of sufficiency.
We have, therefore, his consent given iii April, 1889, to the probate of the will of his krandfather; his taking the legacy provided for under that will; his taking possessibn-of the real estate devised to him by that will; his receipt of its rents and profits, and his subsequent sale th6reof for $20,00%Q and the retention of that sum for his own purposes; his consent to the probate of his grandmother's will, although it clearly does not fulfill the promise he alleges was made on her behalf after the death and funeral of his grandfather; no movement is made on his part or sign of disconteiit given for about seven years thereaf ter, and then he writes letters and files his caveat and
proceeds, as d1ready stated. We have the total lack of diligence in the attempt even to ascertain facts. After his grandmother's death he says that he was still ignorant of the facts which he alleges he has since discovered of the existence of fraud in obtaining the wilf from his grandfather, and of the latter's lack of testamentary capacity, and the existence of (uress and undue influence under which the will was obtained; and lie also av.rs that he was ignorant of the Jaw at the time that lie co rsented to the probate of his grandfather's will that he could not take a devise or bequest under fhat will, and at the same time seek to prevent its probate or to set it aside as an invalid ingtrument. The trial court found that right after

UTERMEHLE v. NORIMENT.

Opinion of the Court.

the death of his grandmother he had the advice of counsel, and if he had been ignorant of any rights he would have been informed of the same.
The plaintiff in error asserts that he gave consent to the probate of his grandfather's will because of the promise of his grandmother to rectify by her will the injustice resulting from the will of his grandfather, and when he found that the promise was broken, on reading the will of his grandmother after her decease, he then waited seven years before proceeding to attack the will of his grandfather, admitted to probate in 1889. The Court of Appeals doubted the existence of the promise, and said it was probably only a promise that he should share equally in his grandmother's estate, which his grandmother fully performed. He says that after the death of his grandmother he was very ill for six weeks, and that for two years he was not in god health, and that he remained ignorant of the fraud and undue influence and duress and mental incapacity of his grandfather until a short time before the filing of the caveat or the writing of the letters. He does not con-
tend that if these facts existed, he did not know that, if proved, they would avoid the will.
He insists, however, that the law pertaining to the taking of a legacy or devise under a will, which prevents the assertion of the invalidity of the same will, ought not to bind him, because he was ignorant that such was the law; in other words, .the law should not cover his case because he was ign(rant that it was the law.
We know of no case where mere ignorance of the law, standing alone, constitutes any excuse or defense against its enforcement. It would be impossible to administer the law if ignorance of its provisions were a defense thereto. There are cases, undoubtedly, where ignorance of the law, united with fraudulent conduct on the part of others, or mistakes of fact relating thereto, will be regarded as a defense, but there must be some element, other than a mere mistake of law, which will afford an excuse. In addition there ought to be no negligence

in attempting to discover* the facts. The ignorance of the plaintiff in error as to his alleged rights, it would seem, was an ignorance of the existence of alleged facts regarding the procurement of the will of his grandfather, but he does not pretend that, had he known of their existence, he was ignorant of their effect as a ground for refusing probate of the alleged will. The ignorance of evidence to substantiate what he knew were his rights is a very different thing from ignorance of the rights themselves, as is stated so clearly by the Court of Appeals; and so it appears in this case that the only obstacle to the enforcement of the rule of estoppel rests in the alleged ignorance of the plaintiff in error that such a rule existed. Although his action in consenting to the probate of the will of his' grandfather was not the result of fraud or misrepresentation, and the other parties to this litigation cannot be placed back in the pos'tion they occupied when the will was admitted to probate, and this condition is the result of the action of the plaintiff in error in consenting to the probate of the will, yet he now contends, notwithstanding all this, that he must be permitted, after the lapse of eleven years, to attempt to defeat the will of his grandfather because he did not know the law applicable to the case in hand. This is a totally inadmissible proposition.
It has been held from the earliest days, in both the Federal and state courts, that a mistake of law, pure and simple, without the addition of any circumstances of fraud or misrepresentation, constitutes no basis for relief at law or in equity, and forms no excuse in favor of the party asserting that he made such mistake. Hunt v. Rousmaniere's Adm., 1 Pet. 1, 15;
Banc of the United States v. Daniel, 12 Pet. 32, 55; United
States v. Hodson, 10 Wall. 379, 409; Lamborn v. County Commissioners, 97 U. S. 181, 185; Snell v. Insurance Co.,. 98 U. S. 85, 90, 92; Allen v. Galloway, 30 Fed. Rep. 466, where Hlammond, J., in reviewing the decisions of this court, says:" Whatever rule may prevail elsewhere, there can be, in the equity courts'of the United States, no relief from a mistake of law." Drake v. Wild, 70 Vermont, 52, 59; inthat case the court said

Opinion of the Court.

(p. 59): "That ignorance of the law does not excuse a wrong done or a right withheld: That relief from liabilities under the law, arising from a known state of facts, will be denied. But to these general rules there are exceptions, as where there is a mistake of law caused by fraud, imposition or misrepresentation. We think it will be found that in most of the cases cited in these notes, and in Pomeroy, the party. seeking relief was led into error by the action of the other party to a transaction, as in contracts and releases." Light v. Light, 21 Pa. St. 407, 412; Storrs v. Barker, 6 Johns. Ch. 166; Whitwell v. Winslow, .134 Massachusetts, 343, 345; Alabama &c. Railway v. Jones,
73 Mississippi, 110; S. C., 55 Am. St. Rep. 488, note. Exceptional cases where relief has been given have been,
as stated, where there was fraud or imposition upon the individual by the person seeking to avail himself of the contract of the other party. In this case there was, as we have said, neither fraud nor imposition, nor misrepresentation; plaintiff in error was not advised that, although he took under the will, he could attack it. It is a simple, bald case of an alleged mistake or misapprehension, on the part of plaintiff, of what the law-was under certain circumstances, with no representation or persuasion on the part of others to cause him to act upon such mistaken assumption.
As to what is the law relating to a party taking the benefit of a 'provision in his favor under a will, there is really no foundation to dispute the proposition that he thereby is precluded from at the same time attacking the validity of the very instrument under which he received the benefit.
In Hyde v. Baldwin, 17 Pick. 303, 308, it was held that one who accepted the beneficial interest under a will was thereby barred from setting up any claim which would defeat the full operation of the will. Drake v. Wild, 70 Vermont, 52, holds the same doctrine. In that case a party was held to be estopped from asserting her title to a trust fund disposed of by the will, because she had accepted the provisions of the will in her own favor. In Bronsan v. Watkins, 96 Georgia, 54, it

OCTOBER TERM, 1904.

Opinion of the Court.

197 U. S.

was held that one who took an estate under a will was thereby estopped from at the same time denying its validity as a will, or from questioning the jurisdiction of the court admitting it to probate, or the regularity of the probate proceedings. In Smith v. Smith, 14 Gray, 532, it was held that the acceptance of a devise estops the devisee to set up a title in opposition to the will, at law as well as in equity. In Fry v. Morrison, 159 Illinois, 244, it was held that one who took a beneficial interest under a will was thereby estopped to set up any right or claim of his own, though otherwise well founded, which would bar or defeat the effect of any part of the will. And in Madison v. Larmon, 170 Illinois, 65, 82, it was again held that one who takes under a will cannot contest it as an heir at law of the devised property. So, in Fisher v. Boyce, 81 Maryland, 46, 53, the court said: "It is a maxim in a court of equity not to permit the same person to hold under and against a will.
It is equally appropriate to the jurisdiction and practice of courts of law. If the appellees claim under the will of their father, they must give it effect as far as they can, and they will then be estopped from denying its validity and genuineness. Waters' Appeal, 35 Pa. St. 523; Thrower v. Wood, 53 Georgia, 458."
When in addition to the fact that he took a benefit under
the will, a party has acquiesced in its validity for many years, and the opposing party in interest has acted upon such consent and acquiescence, and has so changed his position on that account that he cannot be restored to it, and where witnesses have in the meantime died, the reason for the rule upon which an estoppel is founded is thereby greatly strengthened.
Two cases, among others, were cited by counsel for plaintiff in error, in- the court below, andlare referred to in the opinion of the Court of Appeals, and they are also cited here for the purpose of showing his right to maintain these proceedings to set aside the will of his grandfather: They are: Spread v. Morgan, 11 11. L..Cases, 587, decided in 1864; Watson v. Watsot, 128 MA'ssachusetts, 152, decided in 1878.

UTERIEHLE v. NORMENT.

197 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

In the English case it was held that one remaining in pos-
session of two estates, under titles not consistent with each other, thereby afforded no decisive proof of an election under which title to take.' It was there held that the rule was, "that if a party being bound to elect between two properties, not being called upon so to elect, continues in the receipt of the rents and profits of bQth, such receipt affording no proof of preference, cannot be an election to take the one, and reject the other."
We think the case has no application to the one at bar, and is well distinguished in the opinion ofthe Court of Appeals in this .case.
In Watson v. Watson, supra, the general doctrine that any" person taking a beneficial interest under a will, thereby confirmed it and could not set up any right or claim of his own, which would defeat or in any way prevent the full operation of every part of the will, was recognized and affirmed, but it was said (page 155):
"An election made in ignorance of material facts is, of course, not binding, when no other person's rights have been affected thereby. So, if a person, though knowing the facts, has. acted in misapprehension of his legal rights, and in ignorance of his obligation to make an election, no intention to elect, and consequently no election, is to be presumed."
Regarding the legatee who took a legacy under the will, the court continued (at p. 157) as follows:
"But as to Edward the case stands differently. Immediately after being informed of the rule of law, little more than a year after the probate of the will, and before the executor had settled any account in the Probate Court, or the position of any other person had been changed, he returned his legacy to the executor, and gave him notice that he elected not to take it. He cannot therefore be held to have madc such an election as should deprive him of the right under his independent title to partition of the whole estate, not excepting the parcel claimed by respondent."'

In this case the position of other parties to this litigation has most materially changed, as-has already been shown (the
particulars of which need not be repeated), while the plaintiff in error has been also guilty of extreme negligence even in attempting to discover what he alleges are facts. We are satisfied that the plaintiff in error is estopped from now contesting the will, and that great injustice would result from the overturning of the principle adjudged in so many cases.
We are of opinion the case has been rightly decided, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals of the District of Colum-
bia is Affirmed.

KEHRER v. STEWART.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA.
No. 152. Argued January 24, 25, 1905.-Decided February 27, 1905.
As a tax upon the seller of goods is a tax upon the goods themselves, and a tax upon goods sold in one State delivered to a common carrier and consigned to the purchaser in another State is an illegal interference with interstate commerce, a State cannot impose a privilege tax on agents of packing houses as to meats shipped to him from another State merely for distribution to purchasers from his principal; but where the Supreme Court of the State has held that the tax is void as to interstate shipments and applies only to the domestic business of -the agent in the ordinary c6urse of trade, and all other such agents, whether of domestic or foreign packing houses, are subject to the tax, that construction will be accepted by this court as in reality a part of the statute itself, and the tax is within the power of the State and is not as to his domestic business an interference with interstate commerce even though all of the goods sold by an agent may be shipped to him from another State.
Nor is such a tax void because it is laid upon the agents themselves and cannot be apportioned between the interstate and the domestic business carried on by the same person.
While such a tax mnight not apply to an agent whose domestic business was purely nominal and strictly incidental t6 his interstate business, it does apply to one whose domestic business is a definite, although a minor, part of his business in the State as the application of the tax does not depend on the greater or less magnitude of the business.
