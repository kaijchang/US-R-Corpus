The Supreme Court of Oklahoma also rested its denial to petitioners of the right to recover the 1926 tax upon the ground that, having failed to pay the tax for the year when due, they were barred by the provisions of §§ 9971 and 9973 of the Compiled Oklahoma Statutes for 1921. Under these sections, relief by injunction against the collection of any tax is forbidden and a suit to recover a tax alleged to be illegally assessed is allowed only if paid" at the time and in the manner provided by law." But the petitioners' allegations, admitted on demurrer, are that the tax was paid-under duress and compulsion to prevent the issue of respondent's warrant for its collection, to prevent the stopping by respondent of further royalty payments to them, and to prevent the accumulation of statutory penalties. These allegations are sufficient to bring the case within the ruling of this Court in Ward v. Love County, supra,that a denial by a state court of a recovery of taxes exacted in violation of the laws or Constitution of the United States by compulsion is itself in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment. The judgment below. will be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF 1NEW YORK.
No. 47. Argued December 4, 1929.-Decided January 6, 1930.

A private business corporation, licensed by the Federal Power Commission to use, for development of electric power, the surplus water from a dam in the Hudson River, constructed under acts of Con-

gress, placed flash-boards on the crest of the dam, as the license permitted but did not require it to do, and thus raised the level of the water-pool to such an extent as to diminish the head and impair the value of a dam and water-power belonging to riparian proprietors above on the Mohawk River, a navigable tributary of the Hudson. The parties so injured sued the licensee in the New York courts and were awarded damages and an injunction restraining it from maintaining the- flash-boards. Held:
1. That the interest of the plaintiffs in the use of the water, even though subject to destruction under the power of the United States to control navigation, was, so far as the state laws were concerned, a vested right acquired under those laws, and as such was, by § 27 of the Federal Water Power Act, expressly saved from destruction or appropriation without compensation by licensees of the Commission; and that the licensee, by acceptance of the license under § 6 of that Act, must be deemed to have agreed to recognize and protect such interests. Pp. 375, 377.
2., Whether § 21 of the Federal Water Power Act, giving to licensees the power of eminent domain, confers on them the power to condemn rights such as those of the plaintiffs, and whether it might have been invoked by the licensee in this case, were questions not before the Court. P. 379. 249 N. Y. 495, affirmed.

CERTIORARI, 279 U. S. 829, to review a judgment entered in the Supreme Court of New York on remittitur from the-Court of Appeals, restraining the above-named petitioner from maintaining flash-boards on a dam in the Hudson River, and awarding damages.

Mr.CharlesE. Nichols, Jr., with whom Messrs. Robert E. Whalen, Clifford B. Longley, and Wallace R. Middleton were on the brief, for petitioner.
We are dealing with navigable waters of the United States over which Congress has control for purposes of navigation. In the exercise of this power, Congress has proceeded to erect a dam across the Hudson River, including a lock for the passage of boats, and has dredged and maintained the channel in the pool formed by the dam which extends'to respondents' mills.

FORD & SON v. LITTLE FALLS CO.

369

Argument for Petitioner.

Congress has also seen fit to enact the Federal Water Power Act, by which a Commission has been created for the purpose of preserving, enlarging and maintaining the navigable capacity of the waters of the United States over which it has jurisdiction. This Commission, acting within the power delegated to it by Congress, has made a finding that navigation would be benefited by issuing a license to petitioner, which included permission to install the flash-boards, whereby the surplus water at this government dam might be utilized for power purposes, requiring from petitioner, in exchange, that it furnish to the Government electric power for the operation, lighting, repair and upkeep of the lock; that it install, maintain, and operate, at its own expense, such lights and signals as the Secretary of War might prescribe; and that it pay to the United States an annual charge or fee of $5,000.00 for the cost of administration of the Federal Water Power Act and for the use of the government dam and property.
The finding of the Federal. Power Commission that flash-boards are an aid to navigation is conclusive and binding upon the courts and is not subject to judicial review, except in so far as it may be examined for the purpose of determining whether or not it is arbitrary or capricious, and whether or not the act permitted has. a real and substantial relation to the interest of navigation. Where a state court has denied a federal right, this Court has the power to review the record and determine for itself whether there is any basis in fact for the state court's decision,-in this case that the license granted to petitioner does not result in any development and improvement of navigation. The uncontradicted evidence at the trial is that flash-boards do benefit navigation. and, consequently, there is a real and substantial relation between the erection of flash-boards and the interests of navigation.

OCTOBER TERM, 1929.

Argument for Respondents.

280 U. S.

Conceding that the purpose of petitioner was confined to the creation of power, as long as its act was legal, its motive was immaterial; further, the courts may not inquire into the motives of Congress when its activity
is confined within the limits of its constitutional authority; and it is, l-erefore, of no concern to the courts what may have prorrnted Congress in authorizing the Commission to grant the license to petitioner.
The petitioner has done only what the Federal Government itself could do legally and the courts may not interfere with an act for which Congress has provided, in the exercise of its lawful authority to improve navigable waters. For the courts so to interfere extends beyond their judicial powers and is an attempted usurpation of the legislative function which the Constitution has reposed in Congress alone.
There is nothing in the Federal Water Power Act which creates a cause of action in favor of the respondents; and the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution does not afford a basis for the judgment, because there has been no "taking," but only a consequential damage, and because respondents have not been deprived of "private property," inasmuch as their riparian rights are subject to the paramount right of the Government to make improvements for navigation purposes.

Messrs. George E. O'Connor, Thomas O'Connor, and Gerald W. O'Connor were on the brief for respondents.
Respondents' ownership of the water-power, the dam, and the riparian rights is stipulated and conceded.
Under the law of New York the respondents have the right to have the water leave their property at its natural level free from the effect of down-stream obstructions; and the backing of water upon the water-power or lands or buildings of respondents is an invasion of real property rights and constitutes a continuing trespass against which the injured party is entitled to injunctive relief.

FORD & SON v. LITTLE FALLS CO.

369

Argument for Respondents.

These flash-boards were installed by petitioner for its own private purposes and the plea, that it was acting as the agent of the Federal Government in the improvement of navigation for the benefit of interstate and foreign commerce is a mere subterfuge.
The license.was issued, not for a navigation improvement, but for a water-power project for the development of surplus water-power at a government dam.
The finding of the trial court that no navigation purpose is served by the flash-boards is amply supported by the evidence.
Government permission does not give immunity from liability for invasion of private property rights. It is conclusive only against persons claiming under the public right of navigation. No federal com, .oission has the power to give the petitioner permission to take or damage the private property rights of others without responding in damages.
The correspondence regarding the flash-boards, the regulations and the license constitute a, determination by the government officials (1) that the power plant and flash-boards will not interfere with navigation, and (2) of the terms upon which the petitioner shall be permitted to use the water-power owned by the Government at the dam. That is all that the government officials pre
tended to do in this situation. Congress did not, by the Federal Water Power Act,
assume to invest licensees with the privilege of taking or damaging the property of others with impunity. On the contrary, the Act expressly provides that compensation shall be made for the property of others which may be used or damaged; that the licensee shall be liable -for all damages to the property of others, and that. no vested rights in waters shall be affected or interfered with.
If the Secretary of War or the Federal Power Commission purported to invest petitioner with " the title, right,

privilege, and immunity . . . to erect and maintain said flash-boards" and thereby take a portion of respondents' water-power and convert it to its own use for private power purposes, their acts are clearly void.
The Federal Government- has not the right, without making compensation, to take from the respondents waterpower concededly owned by them and transfer the same to the possession and use either of itself or of its licensee, even though the transaction be characterized as a navigation improvement. United States v. Cress, 243 U. S. 316; American Woolen Co. v. New York, 195 App. Div. 698.
MR. JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case comes here on writ of certiorari to review a determination of the Court of Appeals of New York, 249 N. Y. 495, upon which a judgment was entered in the state Supreme Court, awarding damages and an injunction restraining petitioner from maintaining flashboards on the crest of the "Federal Dam," constructed in the Hudson River near Troy, New York, under acts of Congress. Act of June 25, 1910, 36 Stat. 630, c. 382, March 4, 1913, 37 Stat. 801, c. 144.
Respondents, it is stipulated, are riparian owners on the Mohawrk River, above its confluence with the Hudson, where at a point about three miles above the -Federal Dam they own a dam and water power which they maintain for the development of power for use in their factories on adjacent land. The petitioner, a private business corporation, has procured from the Federal Power Commission a license for a hydro-electric power project, purporting to be granted under the Federal Water Power Act of June 10, 1920, 41 Stat. 1063 (U. S. C., Title 16, c. 12). The license granted permission to use surplus water from the Federal Dam for the development of power at a plant to be constructed and maintained by petitioner for that purpose, on government land. As the license also per-

FORD & SON v. LITTLE FALLS CO.

369

Opinion of the Court.

mits, but does not require, petitioner has placed flashboards on the crest of the dam which, under normal conditions, raise the level of the water in the pool above the
dam approximately two feet. Electric power developed by the project is used in the business of an affiliated private manufacturing corporation. The maintenance of the water at the new level has resulted in materially raising the water at the tail-races of respondents' power plants, with a corresponding reduction of the head of water and of the power developed at their dam.
As the court below held, the acts complained of constitute, under local law, an actionable wrong, entitling respondents to an injunction and to damages. Hammond v. Fuller, 1 Paige (N. Y.) 197; Brown v. Bowen, 30 N. Y. 519; Hall v. Augsbury, 46 N. Y. 622, 625, 626; Rothery v. New York Rubber Co., 24 Hun. 172, aff'd 90 N. Y. 30; American Woolen Co. v. State, 195 App. Div. (N. Y.) 698, 705. To avoid this liability petitioner relies on the federal right or immunity specially set up by its answer, that the Hudson and Mohawk are navigable rivers; that all of the acts complained of were done under the license and authority of the Federal Power Commission and under regulations of the Secretary of War, authorized by the Water Power Act; that the license and the acts of petitioner authorized by it were found by the Commission to be
desirable and justified in the public interest for the purpose of improving and developing the Hudson River for the benefit of interstate commerce, and that the petitioner, acting under the license, is an agency of the Federal government, in the exercise of its power to regulate commerce and navigation.
It is contended that the navigable capacity of the Hudson and the Mohawk is subject to the regulation and control of Congress, under Clause 3 of § 8, Art. I, of the Constitution, Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1;' Gilman v. Philadelphia,3 Wall. 713, 724; United States v. Chandler-

U. S. 328, 337, which may constitutionally be delegated to the Power Commission; cf. Wisconsin v. Illinois, 278 U. S. 367, 415; that even if the finding of the Commission that the licensed project is in aid of commerce and navigation is not conclusive, as petitioner asserts it is, and even though some of the power developed by petitioner is used for private purposes, the raising of the level of the water by the use of flashboards is shown by the evidence to be beneficial to navigation, and it was therefore within the competency of the Commission to determine whether the project should be authorized. It appears that the petitioner is required by the license and its acceptance of it to supply from.. the licensed project, power in specified amounts for the lighting and operation of the existing government lock and a second projected lock at the Federal Dam, which are instrumentalities of navigation.
It is argued that Congress, by the Federal Water Power Act, has authorized the Commission to develop navigation and for that purpose to establish obstructions in navigable waters and, subject only to the constitutional requirement of compensation for property taken, its power when so exercised is supreme; that the present exercise of that power does not amount to a taking of the respondents' property for the reason that it does not appear that the obstruction has so raised the water as to flood the respondents' land, and any right of theirs recognized by the state and asserted here, to have the river flow in its natural manner without obstruction, is subordinate to the power of the national government exerted by the Commission through its licensee, whose action so far as it affects respondents' water power, is damnum absque injuria.

Opinion of the Court.

Paper Co. v. Railroad Commission, 274 U. S. 651; ChaseHibbard Co. v. City of Elmira, 207 N. Y. 460; compare
United States v. Cress, 243 U. S. 316. The respondents insist, as the court below found, that
the Federal Dam was designed to be sufficient for purposes of navigation without the flashboards and it was unnecessary to use them for purposes of navigation; that the petitioner had installed them for the development of power for its own private use; that the effect upon navigation of the power plant and flashboards is negligible, hence the licensed project was not one authorized under the Federal Water Power Act. In any case, it is urged that the injury and damage complained of amount to a taking of respondents' property without compensation and, further, that the Federal Water Power Act, by its terms, does not authorize the granting of licenses which would enable the licensee to destroy or affect the rights of riparian owners.
But, in the view we take of the application of the Federal Water Power Act to the present case, it is unnecessary to decide all the issues thus sharply raised. Whether the Commission acted within or without its jurisdiction in granting the license, and even though the rights which the respondents here assert be deemed subordinate to the power of the national government to control navigation, the present legislation does not purport to authorize a licensee of the Commission to impair such rights recognized by state law without compensation. Even though not immune from such destruction they are, nevertheless, an appropriate subject for legislative protection. See United States v. Realty Co., 163 U. S. 427; Guthrie National Bank v. Guthrie, 173 U. S. 528, 535; Joslin Co. v. Providence,262 U. S. 668, 675, 676; Otis v. Ludlow Co., 201 U. S. 140, 152; Oswego & Syracuse R. Co. v. State, 226 N. Y. 351, 356. Especially is there reason for such protection where, as here, their sacrifice may be involved

280 U. S.

in the grant of a valuable privilege to a licensee. We think that the provisions of the Act are quite sufficient in themselves to save respondents from any such appropriation of their water power.
Section 10(c) (U. S. C., Title 16,§ 803(c)) providesthat licensees "shall be liable for all damages occasidned to the property of others by the construction, maintenance or operation" of the licensed project and by § 27 (U. S. C., Title 16, § 821) it is provided, "Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed as affecting or intending to affect or in any way to interfere with the laws of the respective states relating to the control, appropriation or distribution of water used in irrigation or for municipal or other uses, or any vested right acquired therein." By § 21 (U. S. C., Title 16, § 814), licensees are given the power of eminent domain and authorized to conduct condemnation proceedings in district or state courts for the acquisition " of the right to use or damage the lands or property of others necessary to the construction, maintenance or operation of any dam [or] . . diversion structure . ."in connection with an authorized project which, they are unable to acquire by contract. By § 6 (U. S. C., Title 16, § 799), all licenses are required to be "conditioned upon acceptance by the licensee of all the terms and conditions of this Act."
While these sections are consistent with the recognition that state laws affecting the distribution or use of water in navigable waters and the rights derived from those laws may be subordinate to, the power of the national government to regulate commerce upon them, they nevertheless so restrict the Operation of the entire act that the powers conferred by it on the Commission do not extend to the impairment of the operation of those laws or to the extinguishment of rights acquired under them without remuneration. We think the interest here asserted by

the respondents, so far as the laws of the state are concerned, is a vested right acquired under those laws and so is one expressly saved by § 27 from destruction or appropriation by licensees without compensation, and that it is one which petitioner, by acceptance of the license under the provisions of § 6, must be deemed to have agreed to recognize and protect. Whether § 21, giving to licensees the power of eminent domain, confers on them power to condemn rights such as those of respondents, and whether it might have been invoked by the petitioner in the present situation, are questions not before us.

1. Passing upon the Master's report in this case and the exceptions thereto, the Court determines the amounts by which the unlawful diversion of water from Lake Michigan (278 U. S. 367) should be diminished from time to time and- the times to be fixed for each step; the plans proposed for disposal of the Chicago sewage are considered as material only as bearing on what those determinations should be; the defendants must find the way to comply with the determinations. P. 197.
2. The performance to be exaeted of the defendant State is to be gauged by what is possible if it devotes all its powers to the exigency. The State can base no defences upon difficulties which it has itself created, nor upon anything in its own constitution that may stand in the way of prompt action. Id.

In determining the extent to which"the diversion of water should be reduced and the times at, which the reductions should take place, a recent rise in the level of Lake Michigan cannot be taken into account, since, apart from speculation as to the duration of the rise, delays are allowable* only 'for the purpose of limiting within fair possibility, the requirements of immediate justice pressed. by the complaining States.

Pursuant to the opinion reported'in 278 U. S. 367, the case

was referred for the second time to Charles E. Hughes, Esquire, as Special Master. The Master was directed to take testimony on the practical measures needed to dispose of the sewage without the unlawful diversions of water, and the time required for their completion, and to report his conclusions for the formulation of a decree. The decision now reported was rendered after a hearing upon exceptions to the Master's report under the second reference.

Messrs. Raymond T. Jackson, Special Assistant Attorney General of Wisconsin; Gilbert Bettman, Attorney General of Ohio; Wilbur M. Brucker, Attorney General of Michigan; and Newton D. Baker, Special Assistant Attorney General of Ohio; with whom Messrs. John W. Reynolds, Attorney General, Herman L. Ekern, Special Assistant Attorney General, and Herbert H. Naujoks, Assistant Attorney General, of Wisconsin; Henr# N. Benson, Attorney General of Minnesota; and Cyrus E. Wood, Attorney General and Thoras E. Taylor, Deputy Attorney General, of Pennsylvania, were on the brief, for the complainant States of Wisconsin, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Michigan.
No diversion or flow at Lockport is necessary br legally admissible for the purpose of maintaining navigation in the Chicago River as part of the Port of Chicago, or for any other purpose, upon the completion of the program of practical measures.
The Master, in his original report, found that Illinois had no power to divert water from the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Watershed as against the complainant States, and that finding was confirmed by this Court. 278 U. S. 367. His later conclusion would overrule the previous decision of this Court. It would not only authorize Illinois to withhold its entire natural contribution to the Great Lakes System, but also to abstract from two to five

281 U. S.

or six times the amount in addition (depending on whether the domestic pumpage be included). This additional water, contributed by the lower riparian States, would never have been within the boundaries of Illinois except for her unlawful act. ' No equity to take it can be. founded upon a claim that it is or will be useful to the appropriator. It could not be said that the expense which the defendant would save by the appropriation would exceed the damage inflicted upon the complainants. But a State can not justify the taking of waters of another State upon the ground that it can derive a greater profit from their use than could the rightful owner. Wyoming v. Colorado,259 U. S. 419. The complainant States need give no reason for keeping their own. Hudson County Water Co. v. McCarter,209 U. S. 349.
This Court did not delegate to the Master the discretion or duty to apportion the waters between the complainant States and Illinois, on the basis of use which he might think most beneficial, or on any other basis. His exposition of the basis upon which his conclusion rests demonstrates that it is without legal basis and not responsive to the mandate of re-reference issued by the Court.
The Court held that no diversion was admissible in the interests of sanitation and that the defendahts must provide some method of disposing of the sewage other than promoting or continuing the existing diversion. If any diversion were to be justified by reason of or as incident to the disposal of the sewage, the burden was on the defendants to establish both its necessity and extent as an equitable defense pro tanto.
This Court expressly held that Congress had not attempted to authorize any diveision for navigation purposes on the Illinois or*Mississippi Rivers and that no diversion of water for such purposes could be allowed in this case. The Master has specifically found that there has been no subsequent action by the Congress. The

WISCONSIN v. ILLINOIS.

179

Argument for Complainants.

question, therefore, here to be determined is solely whether on the completion of this program, the diversion of any quantity of water will be required in order to maintain such navigation as may use the Port of Chicago and the Chicago River in connection with the Great LakesSt. Lawrence System. There is no navigation in any practical sense coming into the Chicago River by way of the Illinois Waterway or the Illinois-Michigan Canal. Only a few canoes and small pleasure craft have passed through the little lock of the Sanitary District.
With the cessation of all flow at Lockport, navigable depths will be increased in the Chicago River and the Drainage Canal because of the reversal of slope incident
to restoration of the natural flow into Lake Michigan. The inquiry is then immediately reduced to the question of whether any diversion of water is necessary after completion of this program in order to prevent a nuisance which will obstruct navigation in the Chicago River Es, part of the Port of Chicago.
With the completion of practical measures recommended by the Master (less control works) or of complainants' program, for the disposition of the sewage without diversion and with no flow at Lockport, no interference with or obstruction in fact to navigation or navigable capacity will be created in the Chicago River as part of the Port of Chicago.
Assuming, solely for the sake of argument, that the Court, in adverting to the possibility of some negligible quantity of diversion being necessary to maintain navigation in the Chicago River, referred not merely to the preservation of adequate depths and widths, but to the prevention of any nuisance conditions arising from the disposal of the sewage which could create an interference with, or obstruction to, navigation or navigable capacity, complainants assume that the Court did not have in mind any fanciful standard for the Chicago River, but intended

OCTOBER TERM, 1929.

281 U. S.

simply to secure practical conditions which have been found adequate for navigation in line with the experience in navigable harbors generally.
While defendants originally contended that the discharge of the entire volume of raw sewage into the Chicago River did not create any interference with navigation, ever since this Court held that diversion for sanitation is illegal and inadmissible, defendants have steadily attempted to create an impression that, in order to maintain navigation at Chicago, it is necessary to eliminate all possibility of contamination of the water in the River, no matter how negligible, so that in effect it may be as pure as it was when there was no City of Chicago. If the contentions of the defendants were correct, there would be no free and unobstructed navigation at any of the substantial ports of the United States, and navigation, instead of growing, upon the lakes and elsewhere,
would have died out long ago, as the cities continued to grow. On the contrary, it has rapidly increased. Cf. New York v. New Jersey, 256 U. S. 296.
Analysis of the evidence demonstrates that no diversion is necessary to maintain navigation in the Chicago River.
If it be assumed that the program of practical measures recommended by the Master is not adequate to prevent interference with navigation in the Chicago River as part
of the Port of Chicago, with no flow at Lockport, then other available practical measures must be included in the program; and with their inclusion, no claim of a necessity for any diversion to maintain navigation in the Chicago River can be supported.
If an unusual standard of purity and beauty in the interests of navigation is to be adopted for the Chicago River, then there are available practical measures other than diversion for accomplishing such a standard.
Practical measures are available to wholly eliminate the effluent of the sewage treatment works and the discharge

WISCONSIN v. ILLINOIS.

179

of any untreated sewage at times of storm from the Chicago River, if that is deemed necessary. In any event, no permanent diversion in abridgement of complainants' rights is admissible as a matter of law.
Diversion to remove a nuisance created by the sewage of Chicago is not in aid of navigation.
Congress, by general and special legislation, has affirmatively determined that the discharge of local sewage and street wash into any of the navigable waters of the United States shall not constitute an obstruction to navigation or navigable capacity as a matter of law. U. S. C., Title 33, §§ 407, 421. This determination is conclusive. Pennsylvania v. Wheeling Bridge Co., 18 How. 421; Southern Pacific Co. v. Olympian Dredging Co., 260 U. S. 205. It seems that, in New York v. New Jersey, 256 U. S. 296, this statute was not construed.
If the Court should find that there is any basis in fact for any diversion, subsequent to the completion of the program of practical measures, in the interests of navigation, complainants reassert their contentions (laid aside without decision in the opinion of January 14, 1929) that neither the State of Illinois nor the Federal Government has the power to authorize the diversion of any water in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Watershed to the Mississippi Watershed without the consent of the complainant
States. The City of Chicago does not divert the unconsumed
portion of its domestic pumpage; it would have no legal right so to do against the objection of these complainants; and if such a right be conceded for the sake of argument, such a diversion could not be made the basis of diverting an additional quantity of water in derogation of the rights of the complainants.
Domestic pumpage does not cease to be water because it has become in a greater or lesser degree contaminated through its reasonable use for domestic purposes.

The State of Illinois under the circumstances of this case has not the power to authorize Chicago to take its domestic water supply from the Great Lakes Watershed and divert the unconsumed portion to the Mississippi Watershed.

Argument for New York.

This Court has already decided, Wisconsin v. Illinois, 278 U. S. 367, that it has the jurisdiction to determine the extent of diversion, if any, which is legal, and its right so to do is clear.
The Master should have recommended that costs be
taxed against the defendants, including the fees of the Master. Nebraska v. Iowa, 143 U. S. 359; South Dakota v. North Carolina, 192 U. S. 286; New York v. New Jersey, 256 U. S. 296; North Dakota v. Minnesota, 263 U. S. 583.

Mr. Hamilton Ward, Attorney General of New York, submitted for the complainant State of New York.
The program outlined by the Master is not an adequate program of practical measures for the disposition of the sewage in the Sanitary District through other means than lake diversion, as interpreted by the Master, and does not comply 'with the order of this Court dated January 14, 1929.
The inclusion by the Master of controlling works as' a part of his program of practical measures for the disposition of sewage was erroneous because it preserves rather than prevents diversion and because it conditions complainant's relief upon the discretion of the Secretary of War.
Upon the completion of the sewage disposal program, no diversion or flow at Lockport is necessary or legally admissible to maintain navigation in the Chicago River as part of the Port of Chicago.
Diversion is not necessar> in the interests of navigation on the Chicago River as a part of the Great Lakes system.
SUpon completion of* the practical measures recommended by the Master, or of complainant's program, there will be no nuisance in the Chicago River such as to require the diversion of any lake water.

281 U. S.

In New York v. New Jersey, 256 U. S. 296, the discharge 'of sewage into New York Harbor with only simple preliminary treatment for the removal of gross material was held not to be harmful to navigation.
Congress by general and special legislation has affirmatively determined that the discharge of local sewage and street wash into any of the navigable waters of the United States shall not constitute an obstruction of navigation or navigable capacity as a matter of law, U. S. C., Title 33, §§ 407, 421. This is conclusive; Monongahela Bridge Co. v. United States, 216 U. S. 177.
The time allowed by the Master for the constriction and placing in operation of practical measures for sewage disposal is sufficient.
The jurisdiction of this Court to fix the amount of diversion in the interest of navigation has been decided. Wisconsin v. Illinois, 278 U. S. 376. * The Master was correct. in not allowing additional diversion in the alleged interest of navigation in the Illinois
River or Michigan Canal, and in finding it practicable to determine permissible reductions in diversion during the construction.

Argument for Defendants.

The manner and conditions of the discharge and flow of wastes in the navigable waters must be within the paramount power of Congress to regulate. Congress has provided for regulation by the Secretary of War on the recommendation of the Chief of Engineers. It would be improper for the Court to step over into this field of the political department.
The bills do not seek to interfere with the discharge of
Chicago's sewage, wastes "and storm water to the Des Plaines River.
Pursuant to these bills, much evidence was offered by complainants at the 1926-27 hearings, and their witnesses at those hearings never contemplated discharge of treated or untreated sewage and storm waters into Lake Michigan.
This Court's opinion of January 14, 1929, does not contemplate preventing discharge of sewage effluent, waste, storm water and rain water run-off to the Des Plaines River, nor does it intend that diversion from the Lake should cease. The Court understood that the only question involved was as to the amount of water that should be "directly abstracted froni Lake Michigan."
The City of Chicago has the right to take water from Lake Michigan for its domestic purposes and discharge the drainage, sewage or effluent or wastes from sewage purification works wherever in its judgment it may deem most appropriate.
The Supreme Court, in original suits between States, adopts the law of the complainants and defendants as announced by Constitution, statute, or the opinions of their courts. Wyoming v. Colorado, 206 U. S. 46.

The law of the complainant and defendant States is that a city located upon a public navigable waterway has the right to take water for its domestic purposes and appropriate it for all the uses to which the city may put it, such as drinking, cooking, sanitary, manufacturing, fire department and such like, either as riparian owner or by virtue of a grant by the State of such use of public waters, and -nolower or other riparian owner can complain of such use for domestic purposes.

Diversions of water from one watershed to another have been the common practice of complainant States. These diversions have been acquiesced in and were undoubtedly made for the purpose of taking advantage of the natural

resources of the States making the diversions. gee Wyoming v. Colorado, 259 U. S. 419, 466.
The Acts of Congress of 1822 and 1827, and the Acts of Illinois, have brought Chicago within the watershed of the Mississippi River, at least for the purpose of discharging the run-off of the Chicago River drainage area and sewage. Missouri v. Illinois, 200 U. S. 496.
Since about 1865, there has been discharged to the Des Plaines River by way of tte Illinois and Michigan Canal,
or the Sanitary and Ship Canal, and from the Chicago River, an amount of sewage and water equal to the average rain water run-off of the Chicago River drainage area and the sewage and wastes.
After the works recommended in the Master's report for the treatment of sewage and wastes have been installed, then there will have been disposed of and eliminated all the sewage and wastes that may be so disposed of from a practicable standpoint. There will, be left a residue of wastes in the effluents and in the storm water after such works are put in operation. Therefore, a reasonable amount of water will be required and may be diverted from Lake Michigan to prevent nuisance to or interference with navigation or nivigable waters in the port and harbor of Chicago and in Lake Michigan, to prevent pollution and impairment of the domestic water supply, and bathing beaches, and to prevent other nuisances.
The Court in exercising its jurisdiction in controversies between States, will apply the principle of comity and equality of right and opportunity and such equitable principles as will effect a just and equitable solution of the problem under all the circumstances of the case.
Equality of right does not mean an equal division of water. The States stand on an equal level or plane. Each State has the right to take advantage of what nature

281 U. S.

has by reason of its topography, natural resources and other advantages provided it, even though in putting such resources to the best available uses, the State may encroach to some extent upon the solitary rights or the equally full enjoyment of rights of some other State or States. Each State has an equal right to use those great natural assets which are available to many States in common, and in appropriating part is not to be limited by technical or narrow rules. Thus generally the public welfare of the people of all the States will be advanced.
The discharge of the effluent and storm water, together with a reasonable amount of water direct from Lake Michigan, to the Des Plaines River, constitutes the natural and logical method of disposing of these wastes and protecting navigation.
The ordinary rain water run-off of the Calumet and Chicago River drainage areas must necessarily become mixed with and a part of the sewage. In any event, this ordinary rain water run-off has been discharged to the Des Plaines River since 1865. In this there has been such long acquiescence that there can be no possibility of complaint. The amount of water required from Lake Michigan to protect navigation is small, and the effect, if any, upon the interests of complainant States, is negligible in comparison with the great financial burden that would be placed upon the people of Chicago, and the inconveniences from nuisance to the people living at Chicago, as well as to the persons navigating the Lakes.

precedent in applying interstate law principle., in controversies between the States.
The discharge into Lake Michigan of effluent from treatment plants, storm water, untreated sewage therein and drainage, as complainants propose, would forever impair Chicago's only water supply.
The practicable measures required for the disposition of the sewage and wastes of 'the Sanitary District, do not embrace the additional wbrks which the complainants now insist should have been included by the Master.
The diversion from Lake Michigan, when all the sewage treatment works are in operation, should be fixed with relation to the needs and interest of navigation not only of the port and harbor of Chicago, but also of. the Des Plaines and Illinois Rivers. Wisconsin v. Illinois, 278 U. S. 367; New York v. New Jersey, 256 U. S. 296.
Considering the interests of navigation on the Illinois River, as well as that at the port of Chicago, the evidence is undisputed that approximately 5,000 c. f.\s. of diversion, including domestic pumpage, is required to maintain unobjectionable conditions on the Illinois River.
Considering only the waters of the port of Chicago, 2,000 c. f. s., in addition to domestic pumpage and rain water run-off is required for navigation.
The modern trend of thought, congressional legislation, and official action of government and state officers is toward keeping and maintaining navigable and other waters of the United States free from future pollution by sewage and waste contamination of cities. Missouri v. Illinois, 200 U. S. 496; New York v. New Jersey, 256 U. S. 296.
The provision for controlling works to prevent reversals of the Chicago River into the Lake, is part of the defendants' construction program to provide practical measures in order that the amount of water diverted from the Lake, when all the works are in operation, may be reduced to

OCTOBER TERM, 1929.

Argument for Defendants.

281 U. S.

the lowest practicable amount consistent with the interests of navigation and prevention of nuisance to the various interests involved.
Unless such controlling works are installed, it will be impracticable, as the Master found, to reduce the diversion below 6,500 cubic second feet.
The drainage canal and the Chicago River are navigable waters of the United States, and it will be necessary before such controlling works may be installed, that the plans therefor be approved by the Secretary of War, on the recommendation of the Chief of Engineers, under § 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of March 3, 1899. Mortell v. Clark, 272 Ill. 201; People v. Economy Power & L. Co., 241 Ill. 329; Ex parte Boyer, 109 U. S. 628; United States v. Cress, 243 U. S. 316; Perry v. Haines, 191 U. S. 17; DuPont v. Miller, 310 Ill. 140.
The Master has found that such controlling works will not materially interfere with navigation, and has provided by his form of decree that the defendant Sanitary District shall immediately submit plans to the War Department for such control works and that the control works shall be constructed and installed by the Sanitary District within two years after the date of the approval of such plans 8~y the War Department. Consequently, an exception on any prognosis that they may not be built is without merit.
The amounts of the diversion at various times during
the period of construction, and the amount after all the works are completed, should be fixed by the Secretary of War, on the recommendation of the Chief of Engineers.
The opinion of January 14, 1929, intends that the Secretary of War, on the recommendation of the Chief of Engineers, shall continue the exercise of the functions heretofore exercised in fixing the amounts of the diversions in the interests of navigation and its protection as the exigencies of the situation may prompt.

WISCONSIN v. ILLINOIS.

179

Argument.,for Defendants.

The Court ought not to take any action in fixing the amount of the diversion which will invade the sphere
of action of the political department. The Court's opin-
ion of January 14, 1929, must not be so construed and, if it may bear such construction, it should be modified. Sanitary District v. United States, 266 U. S. 405; Pacific
TeL Co. v. Oregon, 223 U. S. 118; Prentis v. Atlantic 'Coast Line, 211 U. S.:210..
It is impracticablefnow to fix amounts of the diversion.
The practical solution fs to provide by the.decree that the
dversion shall be, during the construction period, such amounts as may be determined by permits issued according to law by the Secretary of War on the recommendation
of the Chief of Engineers; but that such permits shall be subject to review by this Court on the evidence already
submitted and any further evidence that may then be presented, .
The time fixed by the Master's Jreport for the installation of all the different works is too short.
: The rise in lake levels since the introduction of the evi'dence on which the. Court's opinion of January 14, 1929, was rendered, should have caused the Master to disregard his conclusion that the Court intended to impose "an immediately heavy burden" in the installation of works. Reasonable time for completion should have been allowed.' The shorter time which would impose such immediately heavy burden is inequitable under the
circumstances. Liberal allowance for unforeseeable delays in the con-
struction of such vast and unusual works, should have been made, which would have extended the construction period beyond the date fixed by the Master.
It is inappropriate at this time to determine which one
of the parties shall pay the costs. Cf. North Dakota v. Minnesota, 263 U. S. 583; Kansas v. Colorado, 206 U. S. 46; Wyoming v. Colorado,259 U. S. 496.

Thompson, Attorney General of Tennessee, Percy Saint, Attorney General of Louisiana, Rush H. Knox, Attorney General of Mississippi, Hal L. Norwood, Attorney General of Arkansas, and Daniel N. Kirby, on behalf of the Mississippi Valley States, intervening defendants, joined in the foregoing brief.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.

These suits, brought to prevent the State of Illinois and the Sanitary District of Chicago from continuing to withdraw water from Lake Michigan as they now are doing, have passed through their first stage in this Court. The facts were set forth in detail and the law governing the parties was established by the decision reported in 278 U. S. 367. It was decided that the defendant State and its creature the Sanitary District were reduc ing the level of the Great Lakes, were inflicting great losses upon the complainants and were violating their rights, by diverting from Lake Michigan 8,500 or more cubic feet per second into the Chicago Drainage Canal for the purpose of diluting and carrying away the sewage of Chicago. The diversion of the water for that purpose was held illegal, buc the restoration of the just rights of the complainants was made gradual rather than immediate in order to avoid so far as might be the possible pestilence and ruin with which the defendants have done much to confront themselves. The case was referred a second time to the master to consider what measures would be necessary and what time required to effect the object to be attained. The master now has reported.Both sides have taken exceptions, but, as we shall endeavor to show, the issues open here are of no great scope.

WISCONSIN v. ILLINOIS.

197

179

Opinion of the Court.

The defendants have submitted their plans for the disposal of the sewage of Chicago in such a way as to diminish so far as possible the diversion of water from the Lake. In the main these plans are approved by the
complainants. The master has given them a most thorough and conscientious examination. But they are material only as bearing on the amount of diminution to be required from time to time and the times to be fixed for each step,'and therefore we shall not repeat the examination. It already has been decided that the defendants are doing a wrong to the complainants and that they must stop it. They must find out a way at their peril.
We have only to consider what is possible if the State of Illinois devotes all its powers to dealing with an exigency
to the magnitude of which it seems not yet to have fully awaked. It can base no defences upon difficulties that it has itself created. If its constitution stands in the way
of prompt action it must amend it or yield to an-authority that is paramount to the State.
The defendants' exceptions deal with the extent to which the diversion of water should be reduced and to the time at which the reductions slhould take place. They argue that a recent rise in the level of Lake Michigan should be taken into account. This cannot be done. Apart from the speculation involved as to the duration of the rise, there is a wrong to be righted, and the delays allowed are allowed only for the purpose of limiting, within fair possibility, the requirements of immediate justice pressed by the complaining States. 'These requirements as between the parties are the constitutional right of those States, subject to whatever modification they hereafter may be subjected to by Congress acting within its authority. It will be time enough to consider the scope of that authority when it is exercised. In present conditions there is no invasion of it by the former decision of this Court, as urged by the defendants. The

OCTOBER TERM, 1929.

right of the complainants to a decree is not affected by the possibility that Congress may take some action in the matter. See Southern Utilities Co. v. Palatka, 268 U. S. 232, 233. Kansas v. Colorado, 206 U. S. 46, 117.
The master finds that, on and after July 1, 1930, the diversion of water from Lake Michigan should not be
allowed to exceed an annual average of 6,500 cubic feet per second in addition to what is drawn for domestic uses. He finds that when the contemplated controlling works are constructed that are necessary for the purpose of preventing reversals of the'Chicago River at times of storm and the introduction of storm flow into Lake Michigan, works that will require the approval of the Secretary of War and that the master finds should be completed and put in operation within two years after the approval is given, -and probably by December 31, 1935, the diversion should be limited to an annual average of 5,000 c. f. s. "in addition to domestic pumpage." On this point we
deal only with the amount and the time. When the whole system for sewage treatment is complete and the controlling works installed he finds that the diversion should be cut down to an annual average of 1,500 c. f. s. in addition -to domestic pumpage. This, he finds, should be accomplished on or before December 31, 1938; and the full operation of one of the contemplated works, the West Side Sewage Treatment Plant, which would permit a partial reduction of the diversion, is to be not later than December 31, 1935.' These recommendations are subject to the appointment of a commission to supervise the work, or, better in our opinion, to the filing with the clerk of this Court, at stated periods, by the Sanitary District, of reports as to the progress of the work, at the coming in of which either party may make application to the Court for such action as may seem to be suitable. All action of the parties and the Court in this case will be subject, of course, to any order that Congress may

make in pursuance of its constitutional powers and any modification that necessity may show should be made by this Court. These recommendations we approve within the limits stated above, and they' will be embodied in the decree. The defendants argue for delay at every point but we have indicated sufficiently why their arguments cannot prevail. The master was as liberal in the allowance of time as the evidence permitted him to be.
The exceptions of the complainants go mainly to a point not yet mentioned. *The sewage of Chicago at present is discharged into a canal that extends to Lock-
port on the Des Plaines River, (which flows into the Illinois, which in its turn flows into the Mississippi,) from Wilmette on the north and a point on the Lake
near the boundary line of Indiana on the south, with another intake midway between these two at the mouth of the Chicago River, which has been r.eversdd from its former flow into Lake Michigan to a flow from the Lake. The change is narrated at length in the former decision of this case. 278 U. S.367, 401, et seq. See also Missouriv. Illinois, 180 U. S.208, 211, et seq. s. c. 200 U. S.496. It is partially to oxidize and carry off this sewage that the main diversion of water is made. The complainants 'demand that this diversion cease, and the canal be closed at: Lockport, with an incidental return of the Chicago River to its original course. They also argue that what is' called the domestic puppage after being purified in the sewage works be returned tQ the Lake. These demands seem to us excessive upon the facts in this case. The master reports that the best way of preventing the pollution of navigable waters is to permit an outflow from the Drainage .Canal at Lockport, and that the interests of navigation in theoChicago River as a part of the port of Chicago will require the diversion of an annual average of from 1,000" c. f. s. to 1,500
c. f. s. in addition to domestic pumpage after the sewage

281 U. S.

treatment program has been carried out. The canal was opened at the beginning of the century, thirty years ago. In 1900 it already was a subject of litigation in this Court. The amount of water ultimately to be withdrawn unless Congress may prescribe a different measure is relatively small. We think that upon the principles stated in Missouri v. Illinois, 200 U. S. 496, 520, et seq., the claims of the complainants should not be pressed to a logical extreme without regard to relative suffering and the time during which the complainants have let the defendants go on without complaint.
Perhaps the complainants would not be very insistent with regard to the 1,000 or 1,500 c. f. s. which earlier in this case they seemed to admit to be reasonable, if their demand were allowed that the domestic pumpage be purified and returned to the Lake-a demand not contemplated by their bill. But purification is not absolute. How nearly perfect it will be with the colossal works that the defendants have started is somewhat a matter of speculation. The master estimates that with efficient operation the proposed treatment should reach an average of 85 per cent purification and probably will be 90 per cent or more. Even so we are somewhat surprised that the complainants should desire the effluent returned. The withdrawal of water for domestic purposes is not assailed by the complainants and we are of opinion that the course recommended by the master is more reasonable than the opposite demand. If the amount withdrawn should be excessive, it will be open to complaint. Whether the right for domestic use extends to great industrial plants within the District has not been argued but may be open to consideration at some future time.
We see no reason why costs should not be paid by the defendants, who have made this suit necessary by persisting- in unjustifiable acts. North Dakota v. Minnesota, 263 U. S. 583.

Opinion of the Court.

A decree will be entered to the effect that, subject to
such modifications as may be ordered by the Court hereafter,
1. On and after July 1, 1930, the defendants, the State of Illinois and the Sanitary District of Chicago, are enjoined from diverting any of the waters of the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence system or watershed through the Chicago Drainage Canal and its auxiliary channels or otherwise in excess of an annual average of 6,500 c. f. s. in addition to domestic pumpage.
2. That on and after December 31, 1935, unless good
cause be shown to the contrary the said defendants are enjoined from diverting as above in excess of an annual average of 5,000 c. f. s. in addition to domestic pumpage.
3. That on and after December 31, 1938, the said de-
fendants are enjoined from diverting as above in excess of the annual average of 1,500 c. f. s. in addition to domestic pumpage.

Mr. Bentley W. Warren, Special Assistant Attorney General of Massachusetts, with whom Messrs. Joseph E. Warner, Attorney General, GeraldJ. Callahan,R. Ammi Cutter, and Manley 0. Hudson were on *the brief, for defendant.*

MR. JusTIcE BUTL-ER delivered the opinion of the Court.

The State of Connecticut brought this suit against the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to enjoin her from diverting waters from the watershed of the Connecticut river to provide water for Boston and neighboring cities and towns.
Legislation of Massachusetts authorizes diversion into the Wachusett reservoir of the flood waters of the Ware river, c. 375, Laws 1926, and of certain waters of the Swift river, c. 321, Laws 1927. The watersheds of these rivers are about midway between the Boston district and the westerly boundary of the Commonwealth. They are tributaries of the Chicopee; all are non-navigable streams wholly within Massachusetts. The Chicopee empties into the Connecticut just above Springfield. The latter' rises in Canada and northern New Hampshire. It flows between New Hampshire and Vermont through Massachusetts and Connecticut into Long Island Sound. It is about 345 miles long and drains 11,300 square miles of which 1,395 are in Connecticut.
The complaint alleges: Connecticut and Massachusetts recognize the common law doctrine that riparian owners have the right to the undiminished flow of the stream free from contamination or burden upon it. Connecticut appears as owner of riparian lands and of the bed of the river and as parens

patriae. The proposed diversion will take water tributary to the Connecticut entirely out of its watershed, will impair navigability of that stream, will take flood waters and thereby cause damage to agricultural lands that axe subject to yearly inundation. The Connecticut is now heavily burdened with offensive matter put into the river' in Massachusetts and requires all the water that naturally comes down the river to prevent it from becoming a nuisance and menace to public health. The diversion will destroy property of Connecticut and of its inhabitants without due process of law and cause injury for which there is no adequate remedy at law. The diversion presently proposed is only a portion of that covered by the plan adopted by Massachusetts which includes the acqui-
sition of the waters of other tributaries of the Connecticut. By its answer and amendments thereto Massachusetts
denies that the proposed diversion will cause any injury o1 damage, and avers that the amount of water to be taken is negligible when compared with the flow of the river where it enters Connecticut, that an emergency exists in Massachusetts constituting a justification for a reasonable use of such waters, that the serious injury to the people of the Commonwealth if diversion be prohibited compared to the trivial damage possibly caused to Connecticut and its people if diversion be permitted should lead a court of equity to give substitutional relihf rather than that specifically prayed, that Connecticut's contention that the diversion will interfere with navigation is not open in the absence of proof that Massachusetts has diverted or actually proposes to divertmore water than is permitted by the War Department, that the proposed diversion is in all respects a reasonable use of the waters in question and that the project will stabilize the flow of the river and result in benefit to Connecticut and the lower riparian owners.

OCTOBER TERM, 1930.

Opinion of the Court.

282 U. S.

By its reply, Connecticut denies Massachusetts' affirmative allegations and alleges that there is no necessity for the diversion and that there is an adequate supply of water in the eastern part of Massachusetts.
The Court appointed Charles W. Bunn of Minnesota as special master and authorized him to take and report to the Court the evidence together with his findings of fact, conclusions of law and recommendations for a decree. The master filed his report and the evidence introduced by the respective parties. It shows that he heard arguments in their behalf, and sets forth his findings and conclusions with a recommendation that the bill be dismissed and that (if it be held that lack of present purpose further to develop power at King's Island does not warrant denial of injunction on that ground) the decree contain a provision for the protection of the owner of the dam and power at that place. Connecticut filed numerous exceptions. Massachusetts made no objection to the report. The Court has heard the arguments of counsel and considered their briefs fo and against the exceptions and upon the final submission of the case.
The report shows that Connecticut sought to prove that any subtraction from the flow of the Connecticut river thr6ugh that State will cause serious damage to the State and its people in that it will impair the navigability of the stream, lessen productivity of river bottom lands by diminution of inundation during times of high water in each year, diminish the power capable of development at King's Island, diminish the run of shad in the river and decrease its capacity to discharge and destroy sewage.
The brief substance of the master's findings of fact follows:
Boston and the surrounding metropolitan area are faced with a serious water shortage in the near future and there is need for a large quantity of additional water. That district includes 35 cities and towns having a population

CONNECTICUT v. MASSACHUSETTS.

660

Opinion of the Court.

of 1,900,000. Other nearby cities and towns are likely in the future to depend on that district for water supply. The total population concerned is now 2,860,000 and it is estimated that it will reach 4,572,000 within forty-years. There is no serious dispute about the need of the region to provide presently for additional water.
Massachusetts applied to the Secretary of War (Act of March 3, 1899, § 10, 30 Stat. 1151) for authority to make the proposed diversions. After hearing both sides and examining the facts, the Secretary permitted diversion of the flood waters of the Ware in excess of 85 million gallons per day between October 15 and June 15 and prohibited the taking of any water except during that period. He permitted diversion of all waters of the Swift except enough to maintain a flow therein of 20 million gallons per day; but he required that, during the period from June 1 to November 30 there shall be released from the impounding dam 110 cubic feet per second (71 million gallons per day) whenever the flow of the Connecticut at Sunderland, Massachusetts (a town 20 miles north of the confluence of the Chicopee and Connecticut) is 4650 cubic feet per second or less, and 70 cubic feet per second (45 million gallons per day) when the -flow is more than 4650 and less than 4900 cubic feet per second. The Secretary found that the discharge at Sunderland of 4650 cubic feet per second corresponds to an average gauge height at Hartford of two feet and that a discharge of 4900 cubic feet per second corresponds to 2.1 gauge height at Hartford.
The annual flow of the Connecticut at the Massachusetts-Connecticut boundary is about 17,000 cubic feet per second, approximately 11,000 million gallons a day. The watershed above that boundary is 9,915 square miles. The drainage of the Ware at the point of diversion on that river is 98 square miles and that of the Swift at the point of diversion is 186 square miles. The diversion permitted

666

Opinion of the Court.

282 U. S.

by the Secretary will furnish about 191 million gallons per day. The Massachusetts Acts do not authorize the diversion of any waters other than the Ware and Swift and as to these the record shows that (as far as counsel can commit it) Massachusetts proposes to abide by the War Department requirements and restrictions.
The total area subject to such diversions is 2.93 per cent. of the watershed above Connecticut. The permitted
diversions represent an average yearly subtraction from the flow of the Connecticut at the state line of about two per cent; but 94 per cent. of. this occurs when the Hartford gauge reads above 3.5 feet'which means *11.5 feet depth of water. The Government has heretofore sought to maintain 10 feet of water below Hartford. A War Department project. contemplates a 12 foot channel. (On that bottom level, 3.5 feet on the gauge would mean' 13.5 feet of water.)
Dredging is required every year to maintain a channel of 10 feet over numerous bars below Hartford. Navigation is difficult when the depth falls below 10 feet. There is no difficulty when there is 12 or even 11 feet. The re-
quired release of water from the Swift river reservoir during periods of low water will somewhat benefit navigation. The maximum diversions are at high water and lessen depth five to six inches. At medium stages the diversion is less and at very low stages the flow is increased. The diversion will not perceptibly or materially interfere with navigation.
The height of floods will be lessened from one to six inches. Because of the diversion, small pieces of hay land will fail to receive flood waters. It is impossible to determine from the evidence to what extent that will occur. The lessening of spring floods will have its advantages and disadvantages; it will reduce some damages and increase others. The damage to the hay land is not shown to be of serious magnitude; and, far from being

CONNECTICUT v. MASSACHUSETTS.

Opinion of the Court.

established by clear and convincing evidence, it is not shown by evidence making it possible of computation or proving that it is large.
There is shown one possible development of power. It is at King's Island in Connecticut where 4,000 horsepower is now produced. The owner has been authorized by the Federal Power Commission to build a higher damto develop approximately 50,000 horsepower. It is not shown that the company has determined so to do, or that the necessary capital has been arranged for. The present use of the water for power purposes will not be disturbed by the diversion. If waterpower shall be developed to the extent of 50,000 horsepower, the diversion will cause an injury of $80,000.
Connecticut failed to establish that the taking of flood waters will be materially injurious to the shad run 6r that the diversion will perceptibly increase the pollution
of the river. The legislative determination to use the waters of the
Ware and Swift was nmade and the Acts of 1926 and 1927 were passed as the result of long-continued and careful study. Connecticut submits two plans to show that the northeastern part of Massachusetts has abundant supplies of water for the Boston district.
The first involves combining water from 15 watersheds on the Assabet, Sudbury, Shawsheen and Ipswicli rivers. The plan involves pumping and also treatment of the water for its purification. From an engineering standpoint it is inferior to that adopted for the WareSwift development. And, while a considerable amount of water from these sources may be made available, most of it is of a, quality much inferior to the waters of the Ware and Swift. And the amount would be inadequate and constitute only a part of the needed supply. The operation of the plan would be of uncertain duration and might have to be abandoned.

OCTOBER TERM, 1930.

282 U. S.

the second plan is based on the taking of water from the Merrimack. That stream drains a large watershed mainly in New Hampshire. It is polluted and the pollution is practically beyond the control of Massachusetts. There is no certainty of its improvement or that it will
not become worse. Ujnquestionably, polluted water may be made wholesome by proper treatment. A considerable amount of industrial waste from mills, cellulose plants, tanneries, rendering works and gas works, of which there are many in New Hampshire, is peculiarly difficult to eliminate from water. The necessary treatment of waters so polluted involves several processes--storage for 30 to 90 days in a large reservoir, aeration, filtration, chlorination. These introduce a human element subject to weaknesses and failures of human nature. Instances of breakdowns are given. There is a small element of danger involved in every -elaborate.system of water puri-P fication. With a single exception, all the witnesses expressed preference for a supply of originally pure water over a purified polluted one. Lawrence is the only city in Massachusetts using Merrimack water for drinking. It consumes an extraordinary amount of bottled water the cost of which in 1916 was about 55 per cent. of the amount paid for public water for all purposes. The plan contemplates the taking of 200 million gallons per day from the Merrimack at Tyng's Island, just below the New Hampshire line. That is about one-quarter of its flow. Factories below the proposed takeout would be liable to suffer damage from the diversion. The stream is navigable below Haverhill and it is not certain whether the taking of that amount would be permitted by the Government. The master says: "I find the taking from the Merrimack ought not to be imposed upon the Boston District. Because first the water is a folluted water and Massachusetts has no adequate control of the pollution or adequate remedy to cure it; that the water is of quality

660

Opinion of the Court.

much inferior to the Ware and Swift and the proposed project inferior from an engineering standpoint to the reservoir and tunnel which the Ware and Swift develop-, ment involves."
The Massachusetts legislation confines itself to the taking of certain waters of the Ware and Swift. The Secretary of War has imposed additional limitations. Massachusetts declares that she intends to divert no more
water than the Secretary of War permits and that she will in every way follow the conditions he imposes.
The exceptions filed by Connecticut need not be set forth or considered in detail. The governing rule is that this Court will not exert its extraordinary power to control the conduct of one State at the suit of another, unless the threatened invasion of rights is of serious magnitude and established by clear and convincing evidence. New York v. New Jersey, 256 U. S. 296, 309. Missouri v. Illinois, 200 U. S.496, 521. The burden on Connecticut to
sustain the allegations on which it seeks to prevent Massachusetts from making the proposed diversions is much greater than that generally required to be borne by one seeking an injunction in a suit between private parties. North Dakota v. Minnesota, 263 U. S.365, 374. There has been brought' forward no adequate reason for disturbing the master's findings of fact. They are amply sustained by the evidence and are adopted by the Court.
Connecticut suggests that, under the common law in force in both States, each riparian ownif has a vested right in the use of the flowing waters and is entitled to have theni to flow as they were wont, unimpaired as to .quantity and uncontaminated as to quality. It maintains that the taking of waters from the Ware and Swift infringes vested property rights in that State which cannot be taken without its consent against the will of the
owners., And it insists that this Court, following the law enforced by each of the States within its own boundaries,

OCTOBER TERM, 1930.

. Opinion of the Court.

282 U. S.

should grant injunction against any diversion from the
watersheds of these rivers. But the laws in' respect of riparian rights that happen
to be effective for the time being in both States do not necessarily constitute a dependable guide or just basis for the decision of controversies such as that here presented. The rules of the common law on that subject do not obtain in all the States of the Union, and there are variations in their application. The doctrine of appropriation prevails in some States. And every State is free to change its laws governing riparian ownership and to permit the appropriation of flowing waters for such purposes as it may deem wise. United States v. Rio Grande Irrigation Co., 174 U. S. 690, 702.
For the decision of suits between States, federal, state and international law are considered and applied by this Court as the exigencies -of the particular case may require: The determination of the relative rights of contending Statep in respect of the use of streams flowing through them does not depend upon the same considerations and is not governed by the same rules of law that are applied in such States for the solution of similar questions of private right. Kansas v. Colorado, 185 U. S. 125, 146. A~id, while the municipal law relating to like
questions between individuals is to be taken into account, it is not to be deemed to have controlling weight. As was shown in Kansas v. Colorado, 206 U. S. 46, 100, such disputes are to be settled on the basis of equality of right. But this is not to say that there must be an equal division of the waters of an interstate stream among the States through which it flows. It means that the principles of right and equity shall be applied having regard to the "equal level or plane on which all the States stand, in point of power and right, under our constitutional system" and that, upon a consideration of the pertinent laws

CONNECTICUT v. MASSACHUSETTS.

Opinion of the Court.

of the contending States and all other relevant facts, this Court will determine what is an equitable apportionment of the use of such waters. Wyoming v. Colorado, 259 U. S. 419, 465, 470.
The development of what Mr. Justice Brewer, speaking for the Court in Kansas v. Colorado, 206 U. S. 46, 98, refers to as interstate common law is indicated and its application for the ascertainment of the relative rights of States in respect of interstate waters is illustrated by Missouri v. Illinois, 200 U. S. 496; Kansasv. Colorado,supra; Wyoming v. Colorado,supra,and Wisconsinv. Illinois,278 U. S. 367; 281 U. S. 179. Two of these cases are much like the one at bar.
Kansasv. Coloradowas a suit to prevent the latter from withholding waters of the Arkansas river from flowing as they were wont through Kansas. The common law rule as to riparian ownership was then generally recognized in Kansas while in Colorado the doctrine of appropriation prevailed. The Court held that the upper State was not entitled to use the waters of the Arkansas flowing therein as it chose regardless of resulting conditions or impairment of the right to the use of such waters in the lower State. It was shown that, without diversion from the watershed, the waters of the Arkansas in Colorado were and for many years had been used to irrigate and make productive what theretofore had been barren lands. It was found that the resulting diminution of the flow of the river caused perceptible injury to a portion of the valley in Kansas but that it had been of little, if any, detriment to the great body of the valley. The Court held (206 U. S. at p. 114) that the rule of equality of right forbade interference with the existing withdrawals of water in
Colorado. In Wyoming v. Colorado the former sued to prevent a
diversion of the waters of the Laramie river which rises

in Colorado and flows into Wyoming. Both States are in the arid region and apply the doctrine of appropriation. Wyoming objected on the ground that the diversion was to another watershed. The Court held (p. 467) that: "The principle of such diversions being recognized in
both States, its application to this interstate stream does not in itself afford a ground for complaint, unless the practice in both be rejected in determining what, as between them, is reasonable and admissible as to this stream, which we think should not be done." The problem there presented was expressed as follows (p. 467): "We are thus brought to the question of the basis on which the relative rights of these States in the waters of this interstate stream should be determined. Should the doctrine of appropriation,. which each recognizes and enforces within her borders, be applied? Or is there another basis which is more consonant with right and equity?" After an elaborate discussion of" the facts, the Court said (p. 470): "We conclude that Colorado's objections to the doctrine of appropriation as a basis of decision are not well taken, and that it furnishes the only basis which is consonant with the principles of right and equity applicable to such a controversy as this is."
It is very clear that, under earlier decisions here, the strict rules for which Connecticut contends are not necessarily controlling in this case. There is nothing in the master's findings of fact to justify an inference that*any real or substantial injury or damage will presently result to Connecticut from the diversions by Massachusetts authorized by the Acts of 1926 and 1927 as limited and defined by the Secretary of War. No discussion is required
as to the effect of the proposed diversion upon the navigability of the river, agriculture, fish life or pollution in Connecticut.

CONNECTICUT v. MASSACHUSETTS. 673

660

Opinion of the Court.

The proposed taking of the waters of the Swift and Ware will not affect the present dam, works or production of power at King's Island. While the owning company has secured authority to build the higher dam, it has not resolved so to do. It is not found and there is nothing to show that it intends to construct any dam or works of a kind or capacity that, if now in use, would be injuriously affected by such diversion. At most there is a mere possibility that at some undisclosed time the owner, were it not for the diversion, might construct additional works capable of using all of the flow of the river including the waters proposed to be taken by Massachusetts. Injunction will not issue in the absence of actual or presently threatened interference. The facts disclose no basis for relief in respect of that property. New York v. Illinois, 274 U. S. 488. New Jersey v. Sargent, 269
U. S. 328, 331, 338.
Drinking and other domestic purposes are the highest uses of water. An ample supply of wholesome water is essential. Massachusetts, after elaborate research, decided to take the waters of the Ware and Swift rather than to rely on the sources in the eastern part of the Commonwealth where all are or are liable to become polluted. We need not advert to other considerations, disclosed by the evidence and findings, to show that the proposed use of the waters of the Ware and Swift should not be enjoined.
Connecticut maintains that the presently proposed diversion will not be adequate for the future needs of the Boston district and that the size and character of the works as well as legislative reports and other circumstances disclose an intention on the part of Massachusetts, when the need shall arise, to draw from other rivers--Millers, Deerfield, Quaboag and Westfield-tribu-" tary to the Connecticut and iisists that the decree should

restrain Massachusetts forever from increasing its diversion to an amount in excess of what the Secretary of War has already indicated would cause no damage to the navi-
gation of the Connecticut. The scope of the project is that shown by the Acts as
limited by the determination of the War Department. It involves no diversion from streams other than the Ware and Swift. Massachusetts declares that she intends to and must obey these findings of the War Department. Her statements before the master and here clearly negative any threat, intention or purpose to make any diversion of water in excess of that specified or otherwise than as set forth in the determinations of the War Dogartment.

Green Bay Co., 13 Wall. 166; United States v. Lynah, 188 U. S. 445; IUnitedStates v. Welch, 217 U. S. 333; United States v. Wayne County, 252 U. S. 574; Monongahela Navigation Co. v.

Argument for Petitioner.

The taking was not accompanied by any revocation of the federal license, and the express promise to pay just compensation negatives any taking under a claim of right.
The Power Company's waiver of compensation cannot operate to deprive the petitioner of its rights to compensation in respect of its own property.
Neither the treaty with Great Britain nor the Federal Water Power Act has the effect of transferring proprietary rights under the laws of the State of New York to the Federal Government.
The taking of petitioner's water rights was pursuant to statute, and was not the mere private or tortious act of the Secretary of War. The extent of a statutory authorization is not to be narrowly or uniecessarily restricted, where the circumstances warrant giving to the words used a wider scope, in order fully to carry out the purpose of the legislation. This is particularly true of a' war-time authorization granted to the President as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, 6r to an agency of the Government acting in the interests of the national defense. Manufacturers'Land & Imp. Co. v. Emergency Fleet Corp., 264 U. S. 250, 255. Cf. Maresca v. United States, 277 Fed. 727, 735, certiorari denied 253 U. S. 498.
If -there was any defect in authority under the National Defense Act, there was, we believe, ample authority for the taking under the 'Urgent Deficiency Appropriation Act of April 17, 1917, c. 3, 40 Stat. 28. Urgent Deficiency At of December 15, 1917, c. 3, 40 Stat. 429.
When the requisition order was made, the Government had full knowledge of petitioner's rights-had, in fact, taken some pains to inquire as to the extent of those rights-and specifically intended to appropriate petitioner's property. The requisition order was a peremptory command,--an act of sovereignty and not an offer to negotiate. Liggett & Myers v. UnitedStates, 274 U. S. 215, 220. By its terms,*the Secretary of War undertook

to inake the requisition in the name of the President "armid by reason of the exigencies of the nptional security and defense."
The Government attempts to argue that petitioner's only remedy is an action sounding in tolt against the Power Company. Such an action would be met at the threshold with the answer that the shut-off of petitioner's water was not effected by the Power Company, but-by the United States Government, acting pursuant to statutory authority.
The taking of petitioner's water was not a mere "regulation" -but wam a substantial deprivation of property, for which compensation must be paid.
Petitioner is entitled to interest as a part of the just compensation guaranteed to it by the Constitution.

Mr. Claude R. Branch argued the cause and Solicitor General Thacher, Assistant Attorney GeneralRugg, and Messrs. Erwin N. Griswold and H. Brian Holland filed a brief; for the United States.
It does not appear that the alleged taking of petitioner's. water rights was, expressly or by necessary implication, authorized by legislative enactment, and in the absence of such authorization, petitioner is without recourse against the United States.
Several statutes, such as the National Defense Act, gave the President broad powers with respect to the appropriation of manufactured articles in time of war. It was doubtless under these that the Secretary of War assumed, in behalf of the President, to requisition the output of the power plant. But the grant of authority merely to requisition the product of a power plant does not authorize the taking of water power from a third party in order to increase the productive capacity of the plant.
It does not appear that the President or the Secretary of War was entitled to requisition anything other than.

Argument for the United States.

electric power which the Power Company could produce by means of facilities and materials over which it had control. Duckett & Co. r' United States, 266 U. S. 149, distinguished.
The res which was taken was "the total quantity and output of the electrical power," and not the -use of waters diverted or capable of being diverted through the canal. The Government did not want water power, and did not take it. It did intend that use should be made by the Power Company of water theretofore used by the Paper Company. But it does not follow from this that the Government intended to expropriate the water. The petitioner was advised of the contents of the requisition order, but it was not directed or requested- to relinquish its water rights either to the United States or to the Power Company. Thus there was no physical taking by the United States of any property belonging to the Paper Company, and the case is distinguishable from Duckett & Co. v. United States, supra.
The execution of the waiver precludes the idea of there having been any appropriation by the United States even of the power produced by the Power Company. Ultimately the Government took nothing, and assumed only to regulate the selection of the Power Company's sale of its product to essential industries. If, as petitioner argues, electrical power is the alter ego of water power, then since the Government did not take electricity it did 'not take
water. There can be no recovery under the Fifth Amendment

must rest on the receipt of a consideration moving to the United States. Bothwell v. United States, 254 U. S. 231; InteroceanOil Co. v. United States, 270 U. S.65, 69.
This case, although not necessarily controlled by Omnia Commercial Co. v. United States, 261 U. S. 502, is more closely comparable to it than to the Duckett case.
The interference with petitioner's property was, at most, a result of the exercise of the power of the United States to reulate industry and the use of natural resources in time of war, for which no compensation is pay-, able. Morrisdale Coal Co. v. United States, 259 U. S. 188; PineHill Coal Co., Inc. v. United States, 259 U. S. 191; Atwater & Co. v. United States, 275 U. S.188.
This Court has repeatedly held that the sovereign may, in the exercise of governmental powers, proinulgate regulations and impose'restrictions amounting in substancb to a deprivation' or even complete destruction of property *rights. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Mottley, 219 U. S. 467;, UnitedStates v. Delaware& H. Co., 213 U. S. 366; Morris v. Duby, 224 U. S. 135; Tagg Bros. v. United States, 280 U. S.420.
If the petitioner is entitled to recover for the taking, it is not entitled to interest.

Mr. 'JusTicE HoLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.'
This is a proceeding by the petitioner to recover compensation f6r property rights in water of the Niagara, River alleged to have been taken by the United States for war purposes. The N iagara Falls Power Company by private grant to it, Letters Patent from the State of New York and acts of the Legislature of that State, was the owner so far as the law of New York could make it owner of land and water rights on the American side of the River above the Falls. Included in them was a power canal thrbugh which the Power Company was authorized

to divert 10,000 cubic feet per second, at the time of the alleged taking. From this canalfe petitioner, the International Paper Company, was entitled, by .conveyance and lease, to draw and was drawing 730 cubic feet per second,-a right that by the law of New York was a corporeal hereditament and real estate.
On December 29 1917, the Secretary of War wrote to the Power Company that "The President of the United States by virtue of-and pursuant to the authority vested in him, and by reason of the exigencies of the national security and defence, hereby places an order with you for and hereby requisitions the total quantity and output of the electrical power which is capable of being produced and/or delivered by you through the use* of all waters diverted or capable of being diverted through your intake canal and/or your plants and machinery connected there-
with." Immediate and continuous delivery of such power Was directed and it was added "You will be paid fair and just compensation for power delivered liereunder.' At the same time an agreement was made by the Secretary of War and the Power Company, (reciting that the President has requisitionfed the power as above,) to the effect
that the Secretary of War " acting for and in behalf of the United States" until further notice waives delivery of the power to the United States on the express, condition that the Power Company shall distribute such powe& as provided in a schedule naming companies and amounts but not naming the petitioner, and on the other side the
Power Company waives all right of compensation by rehson of said requisition if permitted to carry on its business and to sell consistently with the exigencies of the national security and defence. On December 29, the representative of the Secretary of War wrote to the secretary of the
Power Company "Please note that the requisition order' covers also all of'the water capable of being diverted
through your intake canal.... This is intended to cut

off the water being taken by the International Paper ComJ any and thereby increase your productive, capacity," and on December 31 telegraphed to the counsel of the petitioner "Power Company has been directed'to take water hitherto used by International Paper Co." The petitioner had been notified of what was to happen but was allowed time to run out its stock on hand. On February 7, 1918, its use of the water ceased and was not resumed until midnight November 30, 1918, when the order of December 28 was abrogated. The Court of Claims found that the shutting off of the water from the petitioner's mill cost it $304,685.36, direct overhead expense, but gave judgment
that the petition be dismissed. The Government has urged different defenses with
varying energy at different stages of the case. The latest to be pressed is that it does not appear that the action of the Secretarr was authorized by Congress. We shall give scant consideration to such a repudiation of responsibility. The Secretary of War in the name of the President, with the power of the country behind him, in critical time of war, requisitioned what was needed and got it. Nobody doubts, we presume, that if any technical defect of authority had been pointed out it woula have been remedied at once. The Government exercised Ats power in the interest of the, country in an important matter, without difficulty, so far as appears, until the time comes to pay for what it has had. The doubt is, rather late. ,We shall accept as sufficient answer the reference of the petitioner to the National Defense Act of June 3, 1916, c. 134, § 120, 39 Stat. 166, 213; U. S. Code, Title 50, § 80, giving the President in time of war.power to place an obligatory order with any corporation for such product as may be required, which is of the kind usually produced by such corporation.,

Opinion of the Court.

Then it is said that there was no taking, but merely. a making of arrangements by contract. But all the agreements were on the footing that the Government had made a requisition that the other party was bound to obey. Liggett & Myers Tobacco Co. v. United States, 274 U. S. 215, 220. It is said that the Power Company
and the petitioner could withdraw water from the River only by license from the United States, under the Act of June 29, 1906, c. 3621, 34 Stat. 626, and that the license was revoked by what was done: But the Secretary of War did not attempt to pervert the powers given to him in the interest of navigation and international duties to such an end. He proceeded on the footing of a full recognition of the Power Company's rights and of the Government's duty to pay for the taking that he purported to accomplish. There is no room for quibbling distinctions between the taking of power and the taking of water rights.. The petitioner's right was to the use of the water; and when all the water that it used was withdrawn from the petitioner's mill and turned elsewhere by government requisition for the production qf power it is hard to see what more the Government could do to take the use. It is true that the petitioner did not come within the scope of the Government's written promise to pay. But the Government purported to be using its power of eminent domain to acquire rights that did not belong to it and for whih it was bound.by the Con-
stitution to pay. It promised to pay for all the power that the canal could generate.. If it failed to realize that the petitioner had a right to a part of the power, its clear general purpose.,and undertaking was to pay for the rights that it took. when it took the. power.. Phelps .v.

Falls Manufacturing Co., 112 U. S. 645, 656. Of course it does not matter that by a subordinate 'arrangement it directed the use of. the power. to companies that would fulfil its purposes rather than to machinery of its own. That arrangement it was able to make only because it took the power.
We perceive no difficulty arising from the case of Omnia Commercial Co. v. United States, 261 U. S. 502. There the taking of the whole product of a company went no further than to make if practically impossible for that company to keep a collateral contract to deliver a certain amount of steel to the appellant. . But here the Government took the property that the petitioner owned as fully as the Power Company owned the residue of the water power in the canal. Our conclusion upon the whole matter is that the Government intended to take and did take the use of all the water power in the canal; that it relied upon and exercised its power of eminent domain to that end; that, purporting to act under that power and no other, it promised to pay the owners of that power, and that it did not make the taking any less a taking for public use by its logically subsequent direction that the power should be delivered to private companies for work deemed more useful than the manufacture of paper for the exigencies of the national security and defence.
