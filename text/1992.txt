RETIREMENT OF JUSTICE WHITE
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
MONDAY, JUNE 28, 1993
Present: CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST, JUSTICE WHITE, JUSTICE BLACKMUN, JUSTICE STEVENS, JUSTICE O'CONNOR, JUSTICE SCALIA, JUSTICE KENNEDY, JUSTICE SOUTER, and JUSTICE THOMAS.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE said: As most of you know, our esteeemed colleague, Justice White, is retiring from this bench and his colleagues have sent him this letter on this occasion which I will now read.
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES, CHAMBERS OF THE CHIEF JUSTICE,
Washington, D. C., June 23, 1993.
Dear Byron: Your decision to retire from the Court has brought to each of us a profound sense of sadness. You came here more than thirty-one years ago, and have played a pivotal part in the deliberations and decisions of this institution with three different Chief Justices during the administration of eight different Presidents. You brought to the Court a reputation for excellence in many fields-scholar-athlete, combat intelligence officer in the South Pacific during World War II, successful private lawyer, Deputy Attorney General. Your long service here has greatly enhanced that reputation, as you have exhibited
Ix

RETIREMENT OF JUSTICE WHITE
a firm resolve not to be classified in any one doctrinal pigeonhole. The important opinions which you have authored for the Court in virtually every field of law with which we deal will remain as a testament to your years of service here.
Every cloud, they say, has a silver lining; for us the silver lining to your retirement is that you leave in good health, and plan to remain here in the Washington area, at least for the time being. You will be missed at our Conferences, but we will continue to enjoy your friendship which means so much to each of us.
Affectionately, WILLIAM H. REHNQUIST HARRY A. BLACKMUN
JOHN PAUL STEVENS SANDRA DAY O'CONNOR ANTONIN SCALIA
ANTHONY M. KENNEDY DAVID H. SOUTER
CLARENCE THOMAS
JUSTICE WHITE replied as follows:
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
CHAMBERS OF JUSTICE BYRON R. WHITE (Retired), Washington, D. C., June 28, 1993.
Dear Colleagues,
I am grateful for your very generous letter on the occasion of my retirement, which is now upon me. There is no doubt that I shall miss the Court very much, primarily because I shall no longer have the pleasure and excitement of working in a small group of nine Justices, all of whom day after day and year after year are together dealing with the same issues and cases in an attempt to arrive at satisfactory decisions. I have sat with 20 Justices in my time here and have had great respect for the ability and integrity of each of them. I have treasured their friendship. Of course, Jus-

RETIREMENT OF JUSTICE WHITE
tices differ with one another on all sorts of issues, but we have not held grudges and have gotten along remarkably well. That is how it should be.
This Court is a very small organization for the freight it carries, and its work is made possible only by the competent and dedicated service of those who work here. I shall always be grateful to all of them for their willing, friendly and reliable help down through the years.
Since I remain a federal judge and will likely sit on Courts of Appeals from time to time, it will be necessary for me to follow the Court's work. No longer will I be able to agree with or dissent from a Court's opinion. Hence, like any other Court of Appeals judge, I hope the Court's mandates will be clear, crisp, and leave those of us below with as little room as possible for disagreement about their meaning.
The Court is a great institution, and I wish it well. It has been good to me.
Cheers,
BYRON

No. 92-7985. Guy v. WISCONSIN. Sup. Ct. Wis. Certiorari denied. Reported below: 172 Wis. 2d 86, 492 N. W. 2d 311.
JUSTICE WHITE, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins, dissenting.
In this case, the Wisconsin Supreme Court held that police executing a search warrant for narcotics in a private residence were justified in frisking all persons found on the premises for weapons. Because that holding places the Wisconsin Supreme Court in conflict with other state courts, I would grant certiorari.
While executing a search warrant for cocaine at a residence, Milwaukee police rounded up the five persons found on the premises, handcuffed them, and frisked them for weapons. While patting down petitioner, an officer felt a soft bulge in petitioner's pocket that she believed to be cocaine or marijuana. The officer asked petitioner what it was and petitioner told the officer to "f]ind out for [her]self." The officer then reached into the pocket and retrieved a baggie containing bindles of cocaine. In upholding petitioner's conviction for possession of cocaine, the Wisconsin Supreme Court held that the patdown search of petitioner was permissible under Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S.1 (1.968), and that the seizure of the cocaine was proper under a "plain-touch corollary to the plain-view doctrine." 172 Wis. 2d 86, 101, 492 N. W. 2d 311, 317 (1992).
In holding that police had reasonable suspicion to frisk petitioner, the court below noted that "[a] magistrate had found probable cause to believe that cocaine trafficking was taking place in the residence in which officers found [petitioner]" and that "weapons are often 'tools of the trade' for drug dealers." Id., at 96, 492 N. W. 2d, at 315. Other state courts have upheld patdown
searches of persons encountered during the execution of a narcotics search warrant in a private residence on the same rationale. See, e. g., State v. Alamont, 577 A. 2d 665, 6617-668 (R. I. 1990); State v. Zearley, 444 N. W. 2d 353, 357 (N. D. 1989); People v. Thurman, 209 Cal. App. 3d 817, 824, 257 Cal. Rptr. 517, 520 (1989). Others, however, have disallowed patdown searches on essentially identical facts, holding that a defendant's "'mere presence' at a private residence being searched pursuant to a search warrant cannot justify a frisk of [the defendant's] person." State v. Broadnax, 98 Wash. 2d 289, 295, 654 P. 2d 96, 101 (1982); see also United States v. Harvey, 897 F. 2d 1300, 1304, n. 2 (CA5 1990). Specifically, the courts disagree over whether this Court's

ORDERS

509 U.S.

June 21, 1993

holding in Ybarra v. Illinois, 444 U. S. 85 (1979), that police could not frisk all persons present in a public tavern while executing a search warrant based merely on their presence there applies where a search warrant for drugs is executed in a private home. The court below distinguished Ybarra on the grounds that occupants found in a private residence, unlike those found in a public tavern, are "very likely" to be associated with any illegal narcotics activity on the premises and thus likely to be armed and dangerous. 172 Wis. 2d, at 98, 492 N. W. 2d, at 316; accord, Alamont, supra,at 668; Zearley,supra,at 357; Thurman, supra,at 824-825, 257 Cal. Rptr., at 520-521. The Washington Supreme Court in Broadnax, however, rejected this reasoning and held Ybarra to be controlling. Broadnax,supra, at 295, 654 P. 2d, at 101.
In my view, the issue is of significant practical importance to law enforcement officers executing search warrants and to the citizens they encounter while doing so. I would grant certiorari to resolve the constitutional question.

BLACKMUN, J., dissenting

JUSTICE BLACKMUN, with whom JUSTICE O'CONNOR joins, dissenting.
This is a case that touches the raw nerves of life's relationships. We have before us, in Jessica, a child of tender years who for her entire life has been nurtured by the DeBoers, a loving couple led to believe through the adoption process and the then-single biological mother's consent, that Jessica was theirs. Now, the biological father appears, marries the mother, and claims paternal status toward Jessica.
The Supreme Court of Iowa has ruled that Jessica must be returned to her biological parents regardless of whether such action would be in her best interests. See In re B. G. C., 496 N. W, 2d 239 (1992). Jessica, through her next friend, filed an action in Michigan state court, claiming that she has a constitutional right to a determination of her best interests in awarding custody. The DeBoers also filed suit, arguing that federal law authorizes the Michigan state court to modify the custody decree issued in Iowa since the Iowa courts did not at all consider Jessica's best interests, an argument supported by a unanimous decision of the Supreme Court of New Jersey. See E. E. B. v. D. A., 89 N. J. 595, 446 A. 2d 871 (1982), cert. denied sub nom. Angle v. Bowen, 459 U. S. 1210 (1983). The Supreme Court of Michigan rejected the New Jersey decision and concluded that federal law requires deference to the custody decree issued in Iowa even if Jessica's best interests are left unconsidered. See In re Clausen, 442 Mich. 648, 502 N. W. 2d 649 (1993).
Jessica, through her next friend, asks that we stay the decision of the Supreme Court of Michigan until we have had an opportunity to review the issues presented. While I am not sure where
the ultimate legalities or equities lie, I am sure that I am not willing to wash my hands of this case at this stage, with the personal vulnerability of the child so much at risk, and with the Supreme Court of New Jersey and the Supreme Court of Michigan in fundamental disagreement over the duty and authority of state courts to consider the best interests of a child when rendering a custody decree.
I therefore would grant the application for a stay, pending our careful and thoughtful consideration of the petition for certiorari and its disposition in due course. I dissent.

507 U. S.

No. 92-379. ILLINOIS V. CONDON. Sup. Ct. Ill. Certiorari denied. Reported below: 148 Ill. 2d 96, 592 N. E. 2d 951.
JUSTICE WHITE, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, dissenting.
The State of Illinois, petitioner here, seeks review of a judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court holding that a police search of respondent's home, conducted pursuant to a warrant, was unconstitutional because the police failed to knock and announce their presence before entering the premises. Because the decision below is in conflict with those of other courts on the question of what showing police must make to dispense with the ordinary knock-and-announce requirement in executing search warrants, I would grant certiorari.
Based on information provided by informants, police in Du Page County, Illinois, obtained a warrant to search respondent's home. Police had been told by the informants that respondent had been using the residence as a base for cocaine distribution, that residents of the house monitored approaching traffic with closedcircuit surveillance cameras and a police scanner, and that several weapons were kept inside the house. The police also knew that the house was owned by respondent's brother, whom they previously had arrested on drugs and weapons charges and who was then a fugitive.
On the evening of November 6, 1987, a team of police officers executed the warrant. They stormed respondent's home without knocking or announcing their presence and arrested respondent. A search of the home revealed cocaine, marijuana, 13 guns, and marked currency obtained through drug transactions orchestrated by police earlier that day.
At his subsequent trial, respondent contended that the search was constitutionally invalid under the Fourth Amendment because police did not knock and announce their presence before entering his home. The trial court denied respondent's suppression motion, finding that exigent circumstances justified the unannounced entry. Respondent was thereafter convicted on several counts. On appeal, the State Appellate Court reversed respondent's conviction and the Illinois Supreme Court affirmed, holding that the facts did not demonstrate exigent circumstances sufficient to dispense with the knock-and-announce requirement. 148 Ill. 2d 96, 592 N. E. 2d 951 (1992). In so holding, the court turned

ORDERS

507 U. S.

February 22, 1993

aside each of the four circumstances proffered by the State as justifying the unannounced entry: the presence of cocaine in the house and the ease with which it could be destroyed, the existence of surveillance cameras and a police scanner, the presence of weapons in the house, and the fact that respondent's brother had been carrying a loaded pistol at the time of his earlier arrest on drug charges. Id., at 103-106, 592 N. E. 2d, at 955-956. The court also rejected the State's contention that these circumstances should be considered collectively in determining whether the unannounced entry was justified. Id., at 106, 592 N. E. 2d, at 956.
The decision below is in conflict with those of other courts holding that similar factual showings demonstrate "exigent circumstances" justifying an unannounced entry. See, e. g., United States v. Keene, 915 F. 2d 1164, 1168-1169 (CA8 1990) (fact that narcotics on premises could have been quickly destroyed justified unannounced entry), cert. denied, 498 U. S. 1102 (1991); State v. Matos, 135 N. H. 410, 411, 605 A. 2d 223, 224 (1992) (same); State v. Williams, 168 Wis. 2d 970, 985-986, 485 N. W. 2d 42, 48 (1992) (combined presence of drugs and guns on premises justified unnanounced entry). The state courts are particularly divided over whether the presence of illegal drugs alone will justify unannounced police entry on the theory that pausing to announce the search will enable the destruction of evidence. See United States v. Moore, 956 F. 2d 843, 849-850, and n. 9 (CA8 1992) (acknowledging split of authority and collecting cases); Matos, supra, at 412,
605 A. 2d, at 224 (same). Although there are perhaps prudential reasons counseling
against plenary review in this case, I would grant certiorari to resolve the conflict.

These petitions raise yet again the question whether waste byproducts that are not ingestible or marketable may be included in calculating the weight of a "mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of . . . methamphetamine" for purposes of 2D1.1 of the United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual (Nov. 1991). The Circuits are deeply split on this issue. As I noted in Walker v. United States, 506 U. S. 967, 968 (1992), the Courts of Appeals for the Second, Third, and Ninth Circuits have joined the Sixth and Eleventh Circuits in adopting an approach consistent with that urged by petitioners. By contrast, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, joined by the First and Tenth Circuits, has adopted a contrary approach. Ibid. In the decision below, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit adhered to this position, reaffirming its disagreement with the holding of the Sixth Circuit in United States v. Jennings, 945 F. 2d 129 (CA6 1991), and recognizing inconsistency with approaches adopted by the Second and Eleventh Circuits. United States v. Sherrod, 964 F. 2d 1501, 1509-1511, and n. 22 (CA5 1992). The conflict is enduring and the issue important. As a result of the conflict, those convicted of violating federal law are subject to widely disparate sentences, depending only on the federal circuit in which their cases are brought. The issue is a recurring one. Respondent concedes that the Circuits are in conflict, but notes that it did not oppose certiorari in United States v. Mahecha-Onofre, 936 F. 2d 623 (CA1), and this Court nonetheless denied review there, 502 U. S. 1009 (1991), and since has denied review of the issue four more times. Respondent is correct. See Cooper v. United States, 506 U. S. 1041 (1992) (WHITE and BLACKMUN, JJ., dissenting from denial of certiorari); Walker v. United States, supra (WHITE and BLACKMUN, JJ., dissenting from denial of certiorari); Fowner

v. United States, 504 U. S. 933 (1992) (WHITE, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari); Beltran-Felixv. United States, 502 U. S. 1065 (1992) (WHITE, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). This marks the sixth time this issue has come before the Court in two Terms. The Court should resolve this persistent conflict.

No. A-742. FARGO WOMEN'S HEALTH ORGANIZATION ET AL. V. SCHAFER, GOVERNOR OF NORTH DAKOTA, ET AL. D. C. N. D. Application for stay and injunction pending appeal, presented to JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and by him referred to the Court, denied. The order heretofore entered by JUSTICE BLACKMUN on March 31, 1993, is vacated. JUSTICE BLACKMUN and JUSTICE STEVENS would grant the application.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, with whom JUSTICE SOUTER joins, concurring.
Applicants challenged certain provisions of the North Dakota Abortion Control Act, N. D. Cent. Code  14-02.1-01 to 1402.1-12 (1991), in the United States District Court for the District of North Dakota. Relying on our decision in United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739 (1987), the District Court granted summary judgment against applicants. The court reasoned that applicants could not mount a successful facial challenge because they were unable to show that "'no set of circumstances exists under which the [challenged provisions] would be valid."' Fargo Women's Health Organization v. Skinner, No. A3-91-95 (Feb. 19, 1993) (quoting Salerno, supra, at 745). The court denied applicants' motion for a stay and injunction pending appeal. See Fargo Women's Health Organizationv. Schafer, No. A3-91-95 (Mar. 9, 1993). The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit also denied a motion for stay and injunction pending appeal. It agreed with the District Court that the Salerno standard applied and concluded that this Court's decision last Term in PlannedParenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833 (1992), did not counsel a different approach. See Fargo Women's Health Organization

O'CONNOR, J., concurring

507 U. S.

v. Schafer, No. 93-1579 (Mar. 30, 1993). The appeal was expedited, and argument is scheduled for April 14, 1993.
Applicants now ask us for a stay of the District Court's judgment and for injunctive relief. When a matter is pending before a court of appeals, it long has been the practice of Members of this Court to grant stay applications only "upon the weightiest considerations." O'Rourke v. Levine, 80 S. Ct. 623, 624, 4 L. Ed. 2d 615, 616 (1960) (Harlan, J., in chambers). Accord, Certain Named and Unnamed Non-Citizen Children and Their Parents v. Texas, 448 U. S. 1327, 1330 (1980) (Powell, J., in chambers); see also Heckler v. Redbud Hospital Dist., 473 U. S. 1308, 1312 (1985) (REHNQUIST, J., in chambers) ("[A] stay application to a Circuit Justice on a matter before a court of appeals is rarely granted" (internal quotation marks omitted)); Heckler v. Lopez, 464 U. S. 879, 884 (1983) (STEVENS, J., joined by BLACKMUN, J., dissenting in part) ("[I]n such a case the granting of a stay by a Circuit Justice should be extremely rare and great deference should be shown to the judgment of the Court of Appeals"). Consistent with that practice, I vote to deny the stay application. I do not believe applicants have demonstrated that this is one of those rare and exceptional cases in which a stay pending appeal is warranted.
I write separately, however, to point out that our denial of relief should not be viewed as signaling agreement with the lower courts' reasoning. In my view, the approach taken by the lower courts is inconsistent with Casey. In striking down Pennsylvania's spousal-notice provision, we did not require petitioners to show that the provision would be invalid in all circumstances. Rather, we made clear that a law restricting abortions constitutes an undue burden, and hence is invalid, if, "in a large fraction of the cases in which [the law] is relevant, it will operate as a substantial obstacle to a woman's choice to undergo an abortion." Casey, 505 U. S., at 895. And the joint opinion specifically examined the record developed in the District Court in determining that Pennsylvania's informed-consent provision did not create an undue burden. See id., at 885-887 (opinion of O'CONNOR, KENNEDY, and SOUTER, JJ.). While I express no view as to whether the particular provisions at issue in this case constitute an undue burden, I believe the lower courts should have undertaken the same analysis.

JUSTICE WHITE, with whom JUSTICE BLACKMUN and JUSTICE SOUTER join, dissenting.
Under Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477, 484-485 (1981), a defendant who invokes the Fifth Amendment right to counsel during custodial interrogation may not be subjected to further interrogation until counsel is made available to him, unless he subsequently initiates communications. "[I]t is inconsistent with Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966),] and its progeny," the Court concluded, "for the authorities, at their instance, to reinterrogate an accused in custody if he has clearly asserted his right to counsel." Id., at 485. While easily stated, the Edwards rule has not always been easy to apply. In particular, the question of how officials conducting an interrogation ought to respond to a defendant's ambiguous or equivocal assertion of the right to counsel has divided the state and federal courts. The Court should take this opportunity to resolve this important constitutional question.
Virginia police arrested petitioner in connection with the abduction, rape, and murder of 10-year-old Charity Powers. Petitioner was advised of his Miranda rights and agreed to talk to a detective and an FBI agent. During the interrogation, petitioner asked the detective: "'Do you think I need an attorney here?"'

WHITE, J., dissenting

507 U. S.

The detective responded by shaking his head slightly from side to side, shrugging, and stating: "'You're just talking to us."' The interrogation continued and petitioner confessed to the crimes. See 244 Va. 386, 391, 422 S. E. 2d 380, 384 (1992). Petitioner sought to suppress the confession, claiming, inter alia, that the continuation of the interrogation constituted an Edwards violation. The trial court denied the motion and petitioner was tried, convicted, and sentenced to death. Relying on its prior decision in Eaton v. Commonwealth, 240 Va. 236, 253-254, 397 S. E. 2d 385, 395-396 (1990), cert. denied, 502 U. S. 824 (1991), which in turn relied on Edwards'reference to a defendant who has "clearly asserted" the right to counsel, see supra, at 1043, the Virginia Supreme Court affirmed, concluding that petitioner's question "did not constitute an unambiguous request for counsel" and therefore was insufficient to trigger Edwards. 244 Va., at 396, 422 S. E. 2d, at 387. Petitioner now seeks review of this ruling, among others. Pet. for Cert. 11-12.
It has been nearly a decade since the Court acknowledged the existence of three "conflicting standards" used by state and federal courts for determining the consequences of ambiguous or equivocal assertions of the right to counsel. Smith v. Illinois, 469 U. S. 91, 95-96, and n. 3 (1984) (per curiam). Thus,
"[s]ome courts have held that all questioning must cease upon any request for or reference to counsel, however equivocal or ambiguous. Others have attempted to define a threshold standard of clarity for such requests, and have held that requests falling below this threshold do not trigger the right to counsel .... Still others have adopted a third approach, holding that when an accused makes an equivocal statement that 'arguably' can be construed as a request for counsel, all interrogation must immediately cease except for narrow questions designed to 'clarify' the earlier statement and the accused's desires respecting counsel." Id., at 96, n. 3 (citations omitted).
This disagreement has not abated. Although a number of Circuits have since adopted what Smith described as the "third approach," see United States v. Porter,776 F. 2d 370 (CA1 1985); United States v. Gotay, 844 F. 2d 971, 975 (CA2 1988); United States v. Fouche, 776 F. 2d 1398, 1405 (CA9 1985); Towne v. Dugger, 899 F. 2d 1104 (CAll), cert. denied, 498 U. S. 991 (1990), the

ORDERS

April 19, 1993

Sixth Circuit apparently adheres to the first approach. See Maglio v. Jago, 580 F. 2d 202, 205 (1978) (ambiguous invocation requires cessation of all questioning). State high courts also continue to issue conflicting decisions. Kentucky and Texas, like Virginia, now employ a variant of the second, "threshold standard," approach, see Dean v. Commonwealth, 844 S. W, 2d 417, 420 (Ky. 1992) (endorsing Eatonv. Commonwealth,supra);Russell v. State, 727 S. W. 2d 573, 575 (Tex. Crim. App.) (en banc) (right to counsel invoked if "clearly asserted"), cert. denied, 484 U. S. 856 (1987), while other States and the District of Columbia have embraced the third approach, see State v. Staatz, 159 Ariz. 411, 414, 768 P. 2d 143, 146 (1988); People v. Benjamin, 732 P. 2d 1167, 1171 (Colo. 1987), Crawford v. State, 580 A. 2d 571, 576-577 (Del. 1990); Ruffin v. United States, 524 A. 2d 685 (D. C. 1987), cert. denied, 486 U. S. 1057 (1988); Hall v. State, 255 Ga. 267, 273, 336 S. E. 2d 812, 816 (1985); State v. Robinson, 427 N. W, 2d 217, 223 (Minn. 1988).
As it is apparent that a substantial number of criminal defendants who are identically situated in the eyes of the Constitution have received, and will continue to receive, dissimilar treatment because of the different approaches taken by the lower courts, I would grant certiorari.
