Nos. 141, 160. Argued January 23, 1913.--Decided February 24, 1913.
During the lifetime of the ancestor no heir has a vested right to inherit from him; and heirs only have such rights of inheritance as are given to them by the laws in force at their ancestor's death.
It is not an interference with vested rights to prescribe the mode of procedure, or the time within which to enforce them, provided reasonabletime be given therefor.
Under the laws of Porto Rico, while Law Eleven of'Toro as to effect of acts of recognition of rights of natural children may be in force, the provisions of §§ 133 and 137 of the Code of 1902 must be complied with in order to enforce such rights; and this applies to persons whose alleged parent died prior to the enactment of the Code.
Decisions of the courts of Spain rendered after 1898, construing Spanish law applicable to possessions ceded to the United States, although entitled to great consideration, do not preclude the local court, from reaching an independent judgment.

Opinion of the Court.
Mr. N. B. K. Pettingill for appellants.

227 U. S.

No appearance for appellees.

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.

The first of these suits was brought by the appellant, in 1908, it would seem, to have herself declared a natural daughter and entitled to a share of the estate of Don Santiago Rijos Correa, who died on April 29, 1869. The appellees demurred to the complaint on the grounds adverted to in Burnet v. Desmornes, 226 U. S. 145. By the Civil Code of 1889, Art. 137, actions for the acknowledgment of natural children can be instituted only during
the life of the presumed parents, or if the parent dies during the minority of the child within the first four years of its majority. If the appellant was not of age at the death of Correa, she reached majority at the latest in 1893, and the action was barred in 1897. (Under the Code of 1902,
§ 199, the action is allowed only for two years after com-
ing of age.) The Supreme Court sustained the demurrer and dismissed the complaint.
The second suit, begun in June, 1909, had a similar object. The appellant alleged that she was born on August 4, 1875, and was a natural child of Damian Morell; that he left her mother and married in 1880; in 1889 removed to Mallorca, and died on December 29,- 1899. On demurrer the bill was dismissed by the District Court, following the. authority of the foregoing decision of the Supreme Court. (We may assume that as the plaintiff retained her domicil in Porto Rico and as a considerable part of the estate consisted of land in the same place, the possible bearing on the case of the removal of Morell to Spain need not be coisidered.)
The appellants say that at the time of their birth the

law in force was Law Eleven of Toro (Law 1, Title 5, Book 10, Novisima Recopilacion); that under that law they acquired the status and rights of natural children by the facts alleged in their complaints, Without the need of acknowledgment by public document or judicial approval as required in the Civil Code of 1889, Art. 133, and so that they were entitled to sue for their share of the inheritance at once.
So far as The second case goes, perhaps it would be a sufficient answer to say that during the lifetime of an ancestor no heir has a vested right to inherit from him; that the Civil Code of 1889 confines the right of natural children to inherit to those children that are acknowledged, § 134, that is, presumably, to those that are acknowledged as it provides; and since heirs have only such rights of inheritance as are given to them by the laws in force at their ancestor's death, that there is no reason why the appellant should take greater ones because she had been informally acknowledged before 1889.
But in the first case the alleged parent died before the Civil Code was enacted, and so it would seem that the plaintiff had ground for claiming rights by inheritance
vested before that date. But this claim was met by the Supreme Court by a reference to the statement of motives for the Civil Code which reads that if it was proper to give effect to rights acquired under prior legislation, no consideration of justice required that the subsequent ex-
,ercise of them 'as well as their duration and the proceedings for enforcing them should be exempted from the provisions of the Code;' and by the ;interpretation of the fourth Transitory Provision (following Art. 1976). This reads in the official translation, "Actions and rights arising before this Code became operative, and not exercised, shall continue with the extension and according to the terms recognized by prior legislation, but shall be subject, with regard to the exercise, duration, and proceedings

for enforcing them, to the provisions of this Code." The court interpreted these words as meaning that, in order to enforce the rights of a natural child when there was not a solemn recognition but only acts tending to estab-
lish paternity under the Laws of Toro, an action of filiation must be brought as required byArticles 133 and 137
of the Code. In other words, while, under the Laws of Toro, the
acts of recognition alleged, although not amounting to a solemn recognition, may have entitled a natural child to sue for her share of the inheritance and to prove the acts in the same suit, the Code requires a preliminary proceeding to prove those acts and to declare their effect, and limits the time within which such proceeding can be brought. This hardly can be called an interference with vested rights, when a reasonable time for bringing the preliminary proceeding is allowed. In the present case it does not appear that the plaintiff had not reasonable time for an action after the Code went into effect.
It is objected that the Supreme Court of Spain, has construed the fourth Transitory Provision otherwise, as has been recognized by the Supreme Court: of Porto Rico, Gual v. Bonafoux, 15 Porto Rico, 545, 555, referring to a judgment of April 11, 1906, but citing as contradictory one of December 19, 1902, that it deemed correct. The Spanish decisions, however, have not the same effect as do those construing a statute subsequently copied by another State. They were rendered after Porto Rico had ceased to be subject to Spanish jurisdiction, and although entitled to great consideration, which no doubt they received, they do not preclude the local court from exercising an independent judgment. The construction adopted
in Porto Rico at least does no violence to the words of the statute; it concerns local affairs under a system with which the court of the Island is called on constantly to
deal, and we are not prepared, as against the weight prop-

erly attributed to the local decision, to say that'it is wrong. Gray v. Taylor, ante, p. 51. How the first case should have been dealt with if it had appeared in the record that the plaintiff came of age before the Code went into effect we are not called upon: to consider. IThe construction adopted :might give trouble unless a right to bring an action of filiation within a reasonable time were implied. But we have to remember that the law-making power of Spain was not restricted, in the way familiar to us.

Argument for Appellants.

in this case to create a charitable trust that is capable of execution and one which is not void as too indefinite for execution. Where testator names one institution to, carry out a trust and names another as alternate in case the former shall not be able to perform, the court will not declare the trust impossible of execution on account of the failure of the first-named institution to carry it out until after the second named has also tried and failed. Conclisions as to facts reached by two lower, courts will not be disturbed by this court unless manifestly erroneous. In establishing an educational endowment fund the words "Merchant Marine Service of the United States" have a definite meaning sufficient to sustain the trust. 25 App. D.C. 124, affirmed.
THE facts, which involve the construction and validity of a testamentary trust, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Henry E. Davis, with whom Mr. J. K. M. Norton was on the.,brief, for appellants: . The devise does not create a charitable trust.
Admiral Powell made no gift for education. He made a gift for the Navy of the United States. It must be apparent that his purpose was not to aid any university, or any of its branches, nor to aid education; his sole purpose and object, as he expressly declared, was--" to make some contribution to the Navy of the United States."
The carrying out of the bequest in the way designated, cannot, in any way, help the Navy, which was the sole object of his bounty.
The Court of Appeals construed the bequest as a sort of educational trust, and so sustained it, as a charity, citing As authority Vidal,v. Girard, 2 How. 127; Ould v. Washington Hospital, 95 U. S. 303; Spear v. Whitney, 24 App. D. C. 187.
Ineach of these cases, howe ver, the intent,was to create a charity, and the thing created was a 'charity. The Powell bequest was nothing like these cases.
The court fell into the erro:r of supposing that: Admiral Powell intended to aid in education of some sort. If this

had been his purpose he would have created an endowment, the income therefrom to be used to give such free instruction as he might designate.
The bequest does not come under the broadest definition of charitable bequests. Words and Phrases, 1075.
If it does not appear from the instrument that the donor intended a general public charity, it will not be carried out at all, ifb,y reason of its uncertainty or otherwise; it cannot be so carried out as to accomplish the object specified by the donor. Kain v. Gibboney, 101 U. S. 362; Stratton v. .Physio-Med. College, 149 Massachusetts, 505; and see Desty's note to this case, 5 L. R. A. 35; People v. Powers, 147 N. Y'. 104.
In England, inder the law of charitable uses, bequests for charity have been sustained; whilst benevolent gifts, without a designated beneficiary, have been held too indefinite, and therefore void. See Norris v. Thompson, 19 N. J. Eq. 307; Perry on Trusts, § 709; In re Randell, 38 Ch. D. 213 (Eng., 1888); Re Prison Charities, 16 Eq. -129 (Eng., 1873);Story on Eq. Jur., §.1182.
The devise in question, made for the definite purpose of helping,the Navy or paying a debt to the marine pro-
fession, can in no way accomplish the sole purpose of the gift, and so must faiL,
If the devise be held to be a charitable trust, it is yet too uncertain and indefinite to be carried out. Under the devise it is uncertain what young men are to partake of the benefit; no method nor plan for the selection of the beneficiaries is prescribed or provided.
There has never been a bequest that more absolutely' or perfectly fulfilled all the conditions of a void bequest. Norcross v. Murphy, 44 N. J. Eq. 522; Tilden v. Green, 130 "N.Y.29..
If.the charity is general and indefinite and no plan or scheme, is prescribed, and no discretion is given to select. the beneficiaries, 'idtoes not admit of judicial administra-

tion. The will should prescribe some mode. of selection, or give some person discretionary power to select. Fairfield v. Lawson, 50 Connecticut, 501, 513; Beardsley v. Bridgeport, 53 Connecticut, 489; Hughes v. Daly, 49 Connecticut, 34; White v. Fiask, 22 Connecticut, 30, 53; Grimes v. Harmon, 35 Indiana, 198; Church v. Mott, 7 Paige, 77; Goodell v. Union Asso., 29 N. J. Eq. 32.
In South Carolina the English doctrine of charities has been generally accepted, but there, as in England and in the other States of this country, where a particular charity has not been specified, but the charity is of a general nature, without the appointment of trustees to select the beneficiaries, the courts will not devise a scheme for carrying it out. Atty. Generalv. Jolly, 1 Rich. Eq. 99; Gibson v. McCall, 1 Rich. 174.
In Tennessee charitable bequests are upheld quite broadly. Green v. Allen, 5 Humph. 204; State v. Smith, 16 Lea, 662; State v. Ellison, 4 Baxt. 99; 2 Cold. 80; 1 Swan. 360; 7 Heisk. 694.
But the Supreme Court of that State has held that the beneficiary of the trust, or the class that is to take, must be designated by the testator, so that some one or class will have the. right to compel the enforcement. Johnson v. Johnsonj 92 Tennessee, 571.
In Maryland the piinciple is clearly recognized and firmly established, that a trust,*to be upheld, must be of such a nature that the cestuis que trust are defined and are capable of' enforcing its execution by proceedings in a court of chancery.

education afforded under such regulations as the president and faculty of the university rnay think proper. And should it at any time for any reason be impossible to carry into effect the trusts, provisions, and conditions having relation to and herein imposed upon this bequest by me made for the creation of the endowment described on the part of the said Columbian University, or should it be made manifest at any time. that the said trust is not being administered in accordance with my wishes and desires, and in conformity with the conditions specified, then and in such case it is my will and desire that the said endowment shall be placed in other hands, and to that end, and upon the happening of the contingency mentioned, I do hereby give, devise and bequeath the said property to the Johns Hopkins University of Baltimore, in the State of Maryland, and its successors, to be taken and held by the said university or the officers thereof proper for that
purpose, upon the trusts and for the purposes hereinbefore particularly set forth in the bequest of said property to the Columbian University, in such manner that the purposes of the said endowment as by me indicated may be fully carried into effect."
The bill alleges that the Columbian University, supposing it had the right to execute the trust, took possession of the property and has let it to various tenants, and for
more than sixteenyears has issued a catalogue publishing its classes, the names of all of its students, instructors and officers, and the many and various schools of education it maintains, and that the catalogue is widely circulated throughout the United States. The University has, it is alleged, for a like period advertised "The Powell Scholarship,' and notwithstanding the wide circulation of the advertisement the University has been unable to execute the trust.
It is alleged that the devise is so indefinite and the trust intended to be created so uncertain of its objects and sub-

jects that it ie impossible of execution by the Columbian
University, or by the Johns Hopkins University, and has in no wise been executed by either of them; and that therefore the trust is wholly void and of no effect. The collection of the ri-ents and profits by the Columbian University is alleged. It was prayed that the trust be declared void and that the Columbian University be required to account for the rents and profits collected by it.
A demurrer to the bill was overruled, which ruling was sustained by the Court of Appeals. 25 App. D. C. 124.
The Court of Appeals held that the 'devise created a special charitable trust and that it was not void for uncertainty or incapacity of execution apparent upon its face. The court, however, held that the nineteenth paragraph of the bill, which alleged that the impossibility of the execution of the trust 'had been demonstrated, stated a cause of action and remanded the case for further proceedings. Upon the return of the case to the Supreme Court the University answered, by which it traversed the allegations of the bill and alleged in effect that it undertook the trust and has ever since efficiently executed it. It further alleged that its co-defendant, the Johns Hopkins University, is able, ready and Willing -to accept and
administer the trust at any time if for any reason it should be impossible for it, the Columbian University, to administer the same, or "should fail to carry out' the trust in that regard reposed in it."
Testimony was taken, and the trial court found from the facts proved the following:
"First. From the testimony adduced by plaintiffs upon this point, it appears that beginning with the scholastic year 1885-6 (the will of Powell was probated in 1885) the defendant. Columbian University published in its annual catalogues that under the terms of the Admiral Powell Endowment free scholarships- would be given to a limited

number of pupils who were preparing for admission to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis. This notice was in some issues of-the catalogue more explicit, giving in greater detail the terms of.the trust, and in other issues courses of study were given from which the special course contemplated by the terms of the trust might be selected. It further appears from the records of the University that beginning with the scholastic year 1891-2 twenty-four young men actually took a course of study under the Powell Scholarships, in some cases the same man being permitted to pursue the course for more than one year. Of- this number at least two entered the Naval Academy. I find nothing in the evidence showing the net income derived by the University from the trust property, but there is nothing to show that the full net income thereof
was not applied to the administration of the trust. I am of the opinion that the evidence adduced is not sufficient to demonstrate the 'incapacity' of the execution of the trust."
Second. Granting that the testimony was sufficient to demonstrate- the inability of the Columbian University to execute the trust, it did not appear that the Johns Hopkins University might not be able to do so, and that until it "has tried and failed the court would certainly not be justified in frustrating the intention of the testator by bestowing the property upon" the plaintiffs, "related so remotely to him."
The Court of Appeals practically affirmed these conclusions. The court said that while the testimony did not show that the expectations of the testator have been fully answered, and that it had failed "to show that the entire net proceeds of the trust property have been devoted exclusively to the purposes of the trust, and none other, it was sufficient to show that the trust can be executed, as well as that, in some measure, it is being executed." The court said further that it was unimportant to con-

sider defects of execution of the trust by 'theColumbian' Umiversity as that possibi]ity was contemplated by the testator and the Johns Hopkins University appointed as an alternate trustee, and as its ability-tb execute the triist was asserted and not denied "it must be taken as true." These conclusions, so far as they depend upon the testimony, not being manifestly erroneous we must. accept, being the decisions of two courts.
The legal proposition, however, which determined the ruling upon the demurrer and the first decision of the Court of Appeals is open for consideration. That cQurt, as we have seen, decided that the will created a special charitable trust and that the trust was not void.for uncertainty or incapacity of execution apparent upon its face. These propositions are contested. It is contended, first, that the "object of the testator must be - clearly charitable; and, second, the thing he directs to be done must, in its execution, accomplish the charitable object, in some degree at least." I[its argued that these eonditions are not fulfilled by the devise because, it is said, "the testator had no idea of assisting 'either of the universities named, or of assisting any one merely to get an education," and, further, that "his sole purpose, as he himself stated, was 'to make some contribution to. the Navy of the United States."'
The devise, We think, satisfies the tests. The object of the testator was not 'to nVke some contribution to the Navy of the United States." Such contribution was but" an incidental effect, or rather, the-mere -inducement to -the testator's benefaction. The testator's special object was, so far as his property would accomplish it, to give to young men, not having the pecuniary ability to prepare themselves the opportunity to do so. -Preparatory training was necessary; he made it available, to the extent of his means, to young men who otherwise could not bear the expense. And he knew the conditions of appointment,

in whom it rested and the contingencies upon which it depended. If the field of candidacy was limited, he knew that he was helping some to aspire and qualify to succeed. The knowledge and help were definite. He certainly could not designate the individuals. That could be done, and, necessarily was left to be done, by his trustees, one or the. other of them. The purpose of the testator has not been disappointed. In other words, the charitable object has been accomplished,. "in some degree at least "-the test which appellants apply. The finding is that at least two out of twenty-four of those who availed themselves of the scholarships instituted by the Columbian University entered the Naval Academy. We can suppose a better result from a better administration of the trust.
The testator had in view another career for young men besides -the Navy which' could be attained by the same means, that is, "the places of mates or captains in the Merchant Marine Service of the United States." But it is said that "fthere is no such thing" as the Merchant
Marine Service "known to the law" and that "therefore the meaning of the testator in this behalf is left open to ascertainment outside of the testator's language and the provision of the will." The criticism is too exact. The Merchant Marine was and is a very definite and substantial thing hnd had unmistakable definition in general, if not in legal, nomenclature. The meaning of a testator is not required to be found in-law lexicons; the usages of popular speech may furnish a guide to it. Besides, the words "Merchant Marine' receive certain meaning from their context, and it, is easy to put one's self in the place of the sailor testator and appreciate his impulse and purpose. His relatives were remote, his property not large, and he had been an officer in the United States Navy. He desired to assist others to become also officers in that service or. in a cognate service. He knew the equipment necessary and he prescribed it. He chose proper educa-

ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE
OF VIRGINIA.
No. 48. Argued November 12, 13, 1912.-Decided December 2, 1912.
While the police power of the State extends not only to regulations promoting public health, morals and safety but also to those promoting public convenience and general prosperity, it has its limits and must stop when it encounters the prohibitions of the Federal Constitution.
A clash between the police power (of the State and constitutional limitations will not be lightly inferred, but the exact point of contact cannot be determined by any general formula in advance. Hudson Water Co. v. McCarter, 209 U. S. 349.
Governmental powers must be flexible and adaptive. The party assailing the constitutionality of a state police statute must
clearly show that it offends constitutional guaranties in order to justify the court in declaring it invalid. A municipal ordinance requiring the authorities to establish building lines on separate blocks back of the public streets and across *private property on the request of less than all of the owners of the property affected is not a valid exercise of police power, nor does it serve the public safety, convenience or welfare. Such an ordinance takes private property, not for public welfare but for convenience of other owners of property, and deprives the person whose property is taken of his property without due process of law and is unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment. The ordinance of the city of Riclunond based on Chapter 349 of the Laws of Virginia of 1908, requiring the municipal authorities to establish building lines in any block on request of the owners of twothirds of he property is unconstitutional as an attempt to deprive non-assenting owners of their property without due process of law. 110 Virginia, 749, reversed.

ERROR TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
No. 187. Argued March 13, 14, 1913.-Decided April 7, 1913.
The rule that an ancient deed to property in continuous possession of the person producing it proves itself on the theory that the witnesses are dead and it is impossible to produce testimony showing execution by the grantor, is broad enough to admit, without production of the power of attorney, ancient deeds purporting to have been signed by agents.
The other necessary facts being present, and the possession of the property being consistent with its terms and the original records having been lost, a deed, over forty years old containing recitals that it was executed by an administrator under power of sale given by order of the court, will be presumed to have been executed in accordance with such recitals.
Quwre, what rule obtains in the District of Columbia as to whether the power to convey given to two persons named in a will may be executed by the survivor when the designation as executors is descriptive of the persons and not of the capacity in which they are to act.
In the District of Columbia a power of sale given to more than one person named in a will as executors, coupled with the active and continuing duty of managing the property, making disposition thereof and changing investments for the benefit of the family of testator, is not a mere naked power to sell, but one that creates a trust -which survives and can be executed by the survivor.
Where the-duties imposed upon executors.are active and render the possession of the estate convenient and reasonably necessary, they will be deemed trustees for the performance of those duties to the same extent as though declared so to be in the most explicit terms.
35 App. D. C. 562, affirmed.
JOHN H. A. WILSON, of Washington County, District of Columbia, by his will, probated March 20, 1858, after providing for the payment of his debts, devised all of his property, real and personal, to his wife, Adelaide Wilson,

during her life of widowhood for the support of herself and his five minor children. In case of her death or marriage the property was bequeathed to the testator's brother, Thomas 0. Wilson, in trust for the use of the children.
"And I authorize and empower my said brother to exercise his own judgment and prudence in the discharge of the duties hereby confided to him,-and it is my wish and desire that my executrix and executor hereinafter named shall and may at any time they shall deem best and to the advantage of my said wife and children, sell and convey any part or all of my real and personal estate, and invest the proceeds in good stocks or otherwise, as they may consider, best, for the benefit of my said wife and children; in fact, to exercise a sound discretion in the management, disposition and investment of my said estate for the purpose aforesaid, to-wit, for my wife and children."
There was a provision requiring the executrix and executor to care for his servants; . .. "lastly, I do hereby constitute and appoint my dear wife, Adelaide Wilson executrix and my affectionate brother Thomas 0. Wilson executor of this my last will and testament."
The will was probated March 20, 1858. Thomas 0. Wilson, one of the executors, died September 21, 1858. On March 8, 1865, Adelaide Wilson made a deed, in which, after referring to the will and its probate and the authority conferred upon herself and her deceased brother-in-law as executrix and executor to sell for the benefit of the wife and children of the testator, she by virtue of the authority vested in her by said will, sold the land to Leonard Huyck, his heirs and assigns forever.
After eight mesne conveyances, duly recorded, the property, in February, 1905, was sold to the defendant, Chester A. Snow, he and his predecessors in title having held continuous possession of the propeity since 1865.

WILSON v. SNOW.

228 U. S.

Statement of the Case.

Adelaide Wilson died March 28, 1906, and on October 23, 1906, the children brought this action of ejectment against Snow. He claimed under the deed of the executrix, but was not able to prove that she had ever qualified as such. A witness who was familiar with the records in the Register of Wills' Office, testified that he had found therein the will of John H. A. Wilson, with an endorsement that it had been approved by the Register of Wills and an entry in a book that the will had been approved and filed, but that he found no other entries or papers to indicate that either Adelaide Wilson or Thomas 0. Wilson had ever qualified, as executors or received letters testamentary; that the bond book for December 30, 1856, to April 20, 1861, was missing and that in that book the bond of the executors would have been recorded if one had been given; that the books containing the returns of executors from 1856 to 1861 are missing; that he is unable to say whether the qualification of executors would be shown by the bond
book alone or not; that he finds no docket entry relating to the case. Another witness who had frequent occasion to examine the records of the Probate Office between 1857 and 1860 testified that during that period the Probate Office was conducted in a negligent manner; that the witness during that period, in searching for original papers which had not been recorded, found them in a mass of others piled together in an empty fireplace in the building.
There was a verdict for the defendant. A motion for a new trial was overruled. The case was taken to the Court of Appeals, error being assigned on the refusal to charge that the burden was on the defendant to prove that the executrix had qualified; that there was no evidence that she had qualified; that the recitals in the deed were not evidence against the plaintiffs, and on the further ground that the court erred in refusing to direct a verdict for the plaintiffs. The judgment of the Supreme Court of the District was affirmed by the Court of Appeale of

Mr. J. J. Darlingtonand Mr.Hugh H. Obear,with whom Mr. William F. Mattingly and Mr. Charles A. Douglas, were on the brief, for defendant in error.

MR. JUSTICE LAMAR, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court.

The plaintiffs, in this action of ejectment, claimed under the will of their father, John H. A. Wilson. The defendant, Charles Snow, claims under a deed executed in 1865 by Adelaide Wilson, the nominated executrix. On the trial there was proof that the will had been probated in 1858, but no record evidence that the executrix had ever taken the oath of office and qualified as such. After showing the loss of certain books and the negligent manner in which the probate office was conducted from 1855 to 1861, the defendant insisted that the recital that the deed had been executed under the power of sale conferred by the will was sufficient to show that the nominated executrix had taken the oath and qualified as such.
The deed was more than 30 years old. The possession of the land had for 40 years been consistent with its terms, and it was therefore, admissible as an ancient deed proving itself on the theory that the witnesses were supposed to be dead, and that it was impossible to produce testimony to show the signing, sealing and delivery by the grantor. This rule has been extended so as to admit ancient deeds purporting to have been signed by agents without the production of the power of attorney,-the same reason

WILSON v. SNOW.

228 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

that justified the introduction of an ancient deed, without proof of the signature of the witnesses or grantor, authorizing its admission without proof of the capacity in which, or the power under which, it purported to have been executed. For in many cases it would be quite as impossible to prove the due execution by him as agent as by himself as owner. So that where the other necessary facts are present, and the possession of the land has been consistent with its terms, the ancient deed proves itself, whether it purports to have been signed by the grantor in his own right, as agent under power of attorney, or-the original records having been lost-by an administrator under a power of sale given by order of court, not produced but recited in the deed itself. There are cases which support plaintiffs' contention (Fell v. Young, 63 Illinois, 106, 110), but the weight of authority sustains the ruling of the court below. In Baeder v. Jennings, 40 Fed. Rep. 199 (14), 216, 217, Justice Bradley, at Circuit, held that other things concurring, the recitals in an ancient deed were some evidence of the facts recited, and he accordingly admitted the administrator's deed 40 years old, which purported to have been made in pursuance of an order of court- which was not produced. A similar ruling was made in Williams v. Cessna, 43 Tex. Civ. App. 315; 95 S. W. Rep. 1106, where an administrator's deed, executed more than thirty years before the trial, was admitted on the faith of its recitals, proof being made that probate records had been destroyed by fire. In Willetts v. Mandlebaum, 28- Michigan, 521, a deed reciting that it was made in pursuance of an order in a partition suit, was admitted on proof that the records had been lost, the court holding that the same strict proof was not required of ancient probate proceedings as where they were of recent date.

2. The plaintiff, however, insists that, even if the recitals are sufficient to show that Mrs. Wilson had qualified as executrix, her deed could not operate to convey the fee, inasmuch as she could not, by herself, execute the power conferred upon herself and her brother-in-law jointly. It was urged that, in this respect, as in all others relating to the construction of wills, the testator's intention must govern; that he had indicated special confidence in the discretion of his brother, and while contemplating that it might be necessary to sell the property had expressly provided that this could nct be done unless both the wife and the brother joined in the deed. It was further argued that this particular testamentary requirement, for the combined discretion of the two, coincided with the general rule that a joint power cannot be exercised by the survivor.
This is true where the power has been given A and B by name, and according to some cases, it is true also where given to A and B, executors. It is not so where the power has been conferred upon A and B, as executors, or where the power is coupled with an interest. These distinctions have given rise to endless controversies and conflicting decisions-a result naturally to be expected where an official title has been treated as a mere means of describing the persons instead of designating the capacity in which they were to act. It is, of course, true that the same persons may be referred to in different capacities in the same will. A and B may be donees of a naked power; or A and B, who are the executors, may be donees of such a naked power, or A and B, executors, may be given a power to be exercised in their official capacity. In Sugden on Powers (144) it was said "that the liberality of modern times will probably induce the courts to h(ld that in every

WILSON v. SNOW.

228 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

case where the power is given to executors, as the office survives so may the power." This prediction has not been altogether fulfilled, though the tendency is to hold that the words "A and B, executors," "A and B, hereinafter named as executors," "my said executors," is not a roundabout means of designating the individuals who are to act, but confer power upon them in their official capacity which may be exercised by the survivor.
The plaintiffs, insisting that the rule contended for by them is a !rule of property, argue that the authority to "my executor and executrix hereinafter named" conferred power upon Adelaide Wilson and Thomas 0. Wilson nominatim and as individuals only-the words executrix and executor being merely descriptive of the persons later referred to by name, rather than designating the capacity in which they were to act. Numerous cases referred to in Robinson v. Allison, 74 Alabama, 254, are relied on to sustain the contention. Many authorities to the contrary are cited by the defendant in error-among which are Brassey v. Chalmers, 4 De Gex, McN. & G. 528; Davis v. Christian, 15 Gratt. 11; Smith v. Winn, 27 S. Car. 598, where the power was given "executors hereinafter named." Weimer v. Fath, 43 N. J. L. 1. See also Gould v. Mather, 104 Massachusetts, 283, 286; Zebach v. Smith, 3 Binney (Pa.), 69; Clay v. Hart, 7 Dana, 1; Wolfe v. Hines, 93 Georgia, 329; Wood v. Sparks, 18 N. Car. 389.
3. It is unnecessary to attempt to reconcile the authorities or to. determine .which rule obtains in the District of Columbia. For reading this will as a whole it is clear that the power survived because coupled with an interest. It is true that the will did not specifically give the executors any interest in the land, nor was the word "trust" used by the testator. But the power to sell was coupled with the active and continuing duty of managing the property, making disposition thereof, and changing investments for the advantage of his family. Debts were to be paid

228 U. S.

and the executors were to care for the slaves. If in their discretion it became necessary, "my executor and executrix hereinafter named" were to sell all of the property and reinvest the proceeds in good stocks or otherwise; "in fact to exercise a sound discretion in the management,
disposition and investment of my said estate [for the benefit and advantage of] my wife and children." This was not a mere naked power to sell, but created an interest or raised a trust which would preserve the power to sell without regard to whether the interest was beneficial to the executors or not. For it is "the possession of a right in the subject over which the power is to be exercised that makes the interest" or creates "an authority coupled
with an interest" which "survives for the purpose of effecting the object of the power." Peter v. Beverly, 10 Pet. 532, 564; Taylor v. Benham, 5 How. 233; Pomeroy Eq.J. (3d 6d.), § 1011.
And even if, as claimed, the power to sell was not mandatory, it was coupled with duties which, though to
be exercised at their discretion, could not be arbitrarily disregarded by the executors. The duty of management raised the obligation to care for the property, keep it in-
sured, pay the taxes and collect the rents. Adelaide Wilson and Thomas 0. Wilson, whether acting as executors,
or as trustees by implication, having accepted the appointment, were bound also to appropriate the income from the land or the dividends from the stock to the maintenance of the family and the education of the minor children. For neglect so to do any one of the cestui que trust would have been entitled to maintain a bill against the executors, or trustees, to compel them to discharge the duties for the
performance of which full power had been conferred. The rights of the beneficiary would not cease upon the death of either of the representatives, and as the duty to manage
survived, and followed the land, so did the coupled power of sale, which was "manifestly subservient and auxiliary

ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.
No. 319. Argued February 25, 26, 1913.-Decided April 7, 1913.
Under art. 403, Philippine Penal Code, a person can be guilty of murder with alevosia (treachery) although, there may have been no specific intent to kill; and so held that one who had his victim bound and then caused him to be violently beaten with an instrument likely to cause death was guilty of murder with alevosia even though he did not specifically intend that death should result.
Under the Philippine Penal Code, as at common law, men are presumed to intend the natural consequences of their acts.
An objection that a complaint charging murder with alevosia by beating a person to death is defective because it did not allege all the details proved as to the fact that the victim had been bound so as VOL. ccxXvIII-15

APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
No. 192. Argued March 17, 18, 1913.-Decided April 7, 1913.
A declaration in a deed of trust which clearly shows that the sole object of the instrument is to provide for certain specifically named children of the grantor who has other children, so dominates the instrument that the word " children" when thereafter used will be construed as referring to those particular -children and not to include any other children of the grantor.
While the word "heirs" if. used as a term of purchase in a will may signify whoeyer may be such at the 'estator's death, the word "children" as used in the deed involved in this case should be construed as including only those persons answering the description at the time of execution.
Surviving children of the grantor in such an instrument held to include children of one of the children specifically mentioned who had died prior to the grantor.

to her or otherwise according to the construction of the instrument certain of the property conveyed by the deed. Other parties in interest are joined, and argument has been heard on their behalf. The facts are as follows: John Walter, the plaintiff's father, executed the deed on June 18, 1869. At that time his first wife had died leaving five children of whom the plaintiff is one, and he had married agaip.
Two of these children, John Walter, Junior, and William
Walter, were of age. On the date mentioned their father gave them severally certain property in fee simple, and then made the deed before us, reciting therein that he was "desirous of making provision for his children by his first wife, to-wit: Catharine Magdalena Sophia Walter, [the plaintiffI George N. Walter, and Mrs. Barbara King," these three then being under age. The final limiiation is the one to be construed, but it will be understood better when the previous ones have been summed up.
The deed conveys to John Walter, Jr., certain parcels of land in trust, after certain contingent prior payments and after the death of the grantor, to hold the first named parcel and pay the rents and profits to the plaintiff for life and then to hold for the use of her children in fee. It similarly disposes of a bond for $10,000, given by John Walter, Jr., to his father as part consideration for the above mentioned gift to him, stating that it is "in order to equalize the division of my property between my said children." Then comes a gift of the second and third parcels upon like limitations and trusts for another daughter, Mrs. Barbara King, and also of secured notes for $7300, like the gift of the bond for' Catharine, "in order more fully to equalize the division of his property, among his children." The fourth parcel is given upon similar trust for George N. Walter, the youngest son.
Then comes the doubtful clause. "In the event of the death of any one of the above-mentioned children of the

Opinion of the Court.

said John Walter, Senior, to-wit: Catherine, George & Barbara, without leaving any child or children or any issue of any child or children, then and in that case that the property held in trust by said Trustee, party of the second part, for the benefit of the party then dying without issue, shall be sold by said party of the second part, after the death of John Walter, Senior, and the proceeds paid over in equal portions to the surviving children of the said John Walter, Senior." John Walter, Senior, died on April 12, 1907. Before that date George had died in 1892 unmarried, and it is the disposition to be made of his share that is in question here. Barbara had died on August 23, 1904, leaving eight children, defendants herein, and John Walter, Jr., had died on November 17, 1906, leaving two children, defendants herein. William
Walter, who with John had been provided for separately, survives and also is made a defendant. The grantor's second wife afterwards died, childless, and he married a third wife, who died leaving four children, also defendants in,this suit. It may be remarked, if in any way material, that the grantor in 1900 provided for these last mentioned children by gifts similar to the above, subject like them to a life estate in himself.
To begin with the claim of the children of the third marriage, we are of opinion that it is unfounded. The word heirs if used as a term of purchase in a will, might be held to reach forward and to signify whoever might turn out to be such by the law in force and applicable at the testator's death. But this is a deed and the word is children. In view of what we have to say further, it is enough to state our opinion that the word as here used is confined to persons who answered the description at the moment when the deed was executed and spoke.
The Court of Appeals held that all persons were embraced who answered that description at that time, provided they survived the grantor, and directed a de-

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.

228 U. S.

cree in favor of the plaintiffs, Catharine and William Walter. 34 App. D. C. 338. But we take a different view. In the first place we are of opinion that the word children as used habitually in the deed means the three children for whom it declares at the outset that its object is to provide. That very declaration not only dominates the deed as a statement of the sole reason for the whole thing, but foreshadows the mode of referring to these three children in terms broad enough to signify all-'is desirous of making provisions for his children by his first wife'-a phrase only cut down by a'to-wit: Catharine, George and Mrs. King.' When the grantor speaks of equalizing his property "between my said children" we understand him to refer to the three that have been mentioned together under that name. And we understand him to mean nothing different when later he speaks of equalizing the division of his property among his children. This interpretation perhaps is strengthened by the fact that 'my property' cannot properly include that which had been conveyed to his two elder sons and therefore that the equalizing contemplated was an equalizing as between the three children among whom his remaining property was divided by the present deed.
In the clause under consideration he shows whom he had meant by 'said children' when he says 'above mentioned children, . . to-wit: Catharine, George and Barbara'-and when a few lines further on he says 'surviving children' the inference is strong that he means the children that up to that moment he had been talking about by that name throughout. It would seem that the grantor considered that he had made a division that would be fair as against the two elder children who had received their gifts in fee, if each of the three children and after them their descendants respectively received and retained the portion allotted to each. The groups set over against each other in his mind were the two adults

FROSCH v. WALTER.

228 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

and the three minors. If one of the latter died without issue and his share went to the other two the equality
was kept up because all of the three were equally subject to the chance, but assuming a substantial equality between the five lots the two adults being subject to no chance of loss had no claim to a chance of gain. It follows that William Walter is excluded, contrary to the decree of the Court of Appeals.
There remains the question whether children of Barbara King are entitled to share with Catharine as held by the Supreme Court. The Court of Appeals was of opinion that the interest of Barbara King was contingent upon her surviving the grantor, and that as she died before him her children could not take, the word children obviously being used in its proper sense and not embracing issue of such children, mentioned antithetically in the same sentence. It reached this conclusion because the direction to sell and distribute did not operate till after the death of the grantor and in its view the time of distribution determined the time of vesting an individual title in any child. On this point also we take a different view. The limitation over on the death of one of the three children without issue was of general import and scope, and was not confined to such a death before the grantor's. If George had died after his father instead of before the gift over still would have taken effect. Surviving children then means those of the three children who survive the child who dies without issue. The death of the child determines who shall take as surviving children. It is true that if that death happens before the grantor's the distribution is postponed, but that obviously is inserted to exclude any implication that in that event the grantor gives up the life estate that he has reserved throughout. It does not appear to us to warrant the conclusion that the time of the child's death with reference to this collateral fact was to affect the nature or quality of the interest given to the children

who survive. It is true that the gift is contained in the direction for distribution after sale, but in view of our opinion that it would have operated equally whenever George died, and that the reason of the postponement of distribution to after the grantor's death was solely on the grantor's own account, that fact cannot affect the result. The decree of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the original decree of the Supreme Court will be restored.
Decree reversed.

MR. JUSTICE PITNEY, concurring.

I concur in the result reached, and agree with the reasoning expressed in the opinion of the court except upon one point. The opinion states:
"The limitation over on the death of one of the three children without issue was of general import and scope, and was not confined to such a death before the grantor's. If George had died after his father, instead of before, the gift over still would have taken effect."
Upon this point I agree with the view expressed in the opinion of the Supreme Court of the District, that-" The equitable title to George's portion, subject to the life estate of John Walter, Sr., became vested in the complainant herein (Mrs. Frosch) and her sister, Barbara King, at George's death, May 14, 1892. Being so vested, Barbara's share passed by her death to her eight children; and William Walter, the children of John Walter, Jr., and the four children of the third wife, have no share in the said property."

Mr. Antonio M. Opisso and Mr. James H. Blount for appellees.

MR. JUSTICE VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the court.

This appeal brings under review a decree of the Supreme Court of the Philippines in a suit involving conflicting claims to the estate of a Chinese merchant domiciled in those Islands and there known as Vicente Romero Sy Quia, who died intestate at Manila in 1894. The appellants, who were plaintiffs in the Court of First Instance, claim as descendants of a marriage between the intestate and Yap Puan Niu, a Chinese woman, said to have been contracted in 1847 at Am Thau, in the Province of Amoy, China. The appellees claim as the descendants of a marriage with Petronila Encarnacion, a Filipino woman, celebrated in 1853 at Vigan, in the Philippines. The principal question here, as in the Insular courts, is whether the proof sufficiently established the Chinese marriage.
On this the Insular courts differed, the Court of First Instance finding the marriage adequately proved, aid the Supreme Court, one justice dissenting, holding the other way. 16 Phil. Rep. 137. Before coming to the evidence directly addressed to this question it will be well to state the facts about which there is no dispute.
Sy Quia was born at Am Thau, China, in 1822, and went to the Philippines at the age of 12. At first he was located in Manila, but at some time before 1852 went to Vigan and entered the service of a merchant at an annual salary of 200 pesos. During that year he was converted to the Catholic faith and was baptized in the parish church. The next year he married Petronila, the banns being regularly published and the marriage publicly solemnized according to the rites of the church, as a preliminary to which he affirmed under oath, and the civil and ecclesiastical

authorities certified after inquiry, that he was then unmarried. Shortly after the marriage he and Petronila took up their permanent home in Manila. They were then without any particular property other than 5,000 pesos which she received from her mother and brought into the conjugal society. He became a merchant, and through their united efforts they accumulated real and personal property amounting at the time of his death to upwards of
600,000 pesos. They lived in a manner becoming the marital state and were universally recognized as husband
and wife. Three sons and two daughters were born of the marriage. One of the daughters married and predeceased her father, leaving a son surviving. The other died after the father, leaving the mother as her only heir. Following Sy Quia's death the widow administered the estate, with the aid of the sons, until 1900, when through appropriate judicial proceedings the property was distributed among the *widow, sons and grandson as the persons rightly entitled thereto. The present suit was brought in 1905, more than half a century after the marriage, and then for the first time was its validity or its good faith as to either spouse brought in question-a fact which is of particular significance, first, because Yap Puan Niu, the alleged Chinese wife, visited in Manila at the home of a brother' of Sy Quia twice during the life of the latter, and, second, because two of the plaintiffs were adults living in Manila at the time of Sy Quia's death and during the eleven years intervening before the suit was brought.
There was testimony, taken by way of depositions in
China, tending to show that Sy Quia returned from the Philippines to Am Thau in 1847, when he was 25 years old; that during that year he married Yap Puan Niu,the marriage being properly arranged and celebrated; that he remained at Am Thau three or four years, during which two sons were born of this marriage; that he then returned to the Philippines and Yap Puan Niu continued to reside

at Am Thau, dying there in 1891; that the four plaintiffs are the only living descendants of this marriage, two being grandsons, one a granddaughter, and one a great-grandson. Six of the witnesses in China testified directly to the marriage, and their testimony, if standing alone, would be quite persuasive of its occurrence, notwithstanding some discrepancies in their statements. But this testimony did not stand alone. It was met and contradicted by that of several Filipino witnesses, taken mostly by deposition, to the effect that they had known Sy Quia in Vigan for some years before his marriage to Petronila in 1853, and that he was living there during the period when, according to the opposing testimony, he married Yap Puan Niu and remained in China. One of these witnesses was an aged man, who testified with certainty that he was a student at Manila between 1839 and 1845 and knew Sy Quia there; that he, the witness, was married at Vigan in 1847, and that Sy Quia was living there then. Others of these witnesses gave kindred reasons for their. ability to speak with precision concerning Sy Quia's presence at Vigan during the period in question. Still other witnesses gave testimony more or less corroborative of these opposing theories, but it was less direct and was also contradictory.
In addition to this conflicting testimony there was this situation, as before indicated: The Philippine marriage and the forty years of uninterrupted marital life following it were not only established but conceded. While Sy Quia lived- the validity of that marriage passed unchallenged and no right was asserted under the one alleged to have occurred in China. More than this, the right of the widow and children of the Philippine marriage to the property acquired during its existence went unquestioned for eleven years after his death and for five years after the judicial distribution of the property.
In these circumstances every presumption was in favor

of the validity and good faith of the Philippine marriage, and sound reason required that it be not impugned and
discredited through the alleged prior marriage save upon proof so clear, strong and unequivocal as to produce a
moral conviction of the existence of that impediment. The conflicting testimony, isolatedly considered, did not measure up to this standard, and clearly it did not-do so if proper regard was had for the probative force of the conduct of all the parties concerned during the many intervening years. Then, too, the lips of Sy Quia and Yap Puan Niu had been sealed by death, and this, with the long interval of time, gave unusual opportunity for the use of fabricated testimony, the untruth of which it would be difficult to expose.
Giving due effect to these considerations, we cannot say that the Supreme Court of the Philippines erred in holding that the Chinese marriage was not adequately proved. Indeed, we regard the evidence as not producing a moral conviction of the existence of that marriage, but as leaving the issue in serious doubt. The decree is accordingly
Affirmed.

the company had no property within the city and county other than that returned by it. We say this because the fraud, accident or mistake which will justify equitable relief must be something more than what is fairly covered by the charge here made, for otherwise the well settled rule that mere illegality in a tax affords no ground for such relief would be a myth. There really would be no case in which the illegality could not be said with equal propriety to be the result of fraud, accident or mistake, for it always arises out of some deviation from law or duty.
Concluding, as we do, that the company had a plain, adequate and complete remedy at law, the decree dismissing the bill is

NMn. JUSTICE VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the court.

This suit was begun by a petition for partition and to quiet title, filed by George W. Bond and eighty-two others in the District Court of Valencia County, New Mexico, against the unknown heirs of twenty-nine persons named, all deceased, and the unknown owners, proprietors and claimants of the premises commonly called the Tom6 grant situate in that county and described as containing 121,594.53 acres. The plaintiffs alleged that they were owners of an undivided half interest.
The town of Tom6 appeared and answered, denying any title or interest in the plaintiffs, averring that the grant by Spain was to the town in communal right, was confirmed by act of Congress to the town, a then existing municipality, was so patented by the United States, and was incorporated under the laws of New Mexico; that allotments were made of parts of the land to settlers on the grant in fee in severalty, and ownership of the residue was in the municipality and had been held by it exclusively
and adversely since it was patented, April 5, 1871. Doroteo Chaves, with three hundred and ninety-one
others, appeared and answered, denying any individual right in any of the plaintiffs, adopting the answer of the town as to the communal character of the grant, averring that they were themselves severally owners in fee of parts of the grant, and resisting partition.

I Opinion of the Court.

229 U. S.

Translations of the title papers were, by stipulation, made parts of the answers. Demurrers to the latter were overruled, and a reply was filed, to which there was a demurrer. This demurrer was sustained, and, the plaintiffs electing to stand upon their reply, judgment was rendered dismissing the suit. Upon the plaintiffs' appeal te Supreme Court of the Territory affirmed the judgment, 16 New Mex. 660, and on a further appeal the case is now before this court.
The facts are settled by the pleadings. The questions here are, whether the original grant made by the Crown of Spain in 1739 was in fee in individual right or in communal right to the town, title remaining in the Crown except as to specific parcels allotted to individuals, and whether, if it was a grant in individual right, the confirming act of Congress, and the patent pursuant thereto, changed its character.
The facts, as shown by the record, are these: Juan Barela, with twenty-eight others, in 1739 petitioned that the governor "be pleased to donate to them the land called Tom6 Doininguez, granted to those who first solicited the same and who declined settling thereon." The governor (lid "grant to them, in the name of His Majesty, whom may God preserve, the land petitioned for, called the land of Tom6 Dominguez, for themselves, their successors, and whomever may have a right thereto under the conditions and circumstances required in such cases, and which is to be without prohibition to any one desiring to settle the same, holding and improving it during the time required by law. In view of which, I should order, and did order, that said senior justice or his lieutenant, whose duty it is, shall place them in possession of the aforementioned lands, giving in all cases to each one the portion he may be entitled to in order to avoid difficulties which may occur in the future."
There was a giving of "Juridical possession," a form and

ceremony essential to the passing of title by grant under the Spanish law. The report of the officer conducting this ceremony, so far as here material, is as follows: "In the new settlement of 'Nuestra Sefiora de l Concepcion de Thomi Dominguez,' instituted and established by Don Gaspar Mendoza, actual governor and captain general of this Kingdom of New Mexico, on the thirtieth day of the month of July, in the year one thousand seven hundred and thirty-nine, . . . the parties concerned being together, I proceeded to the above-mentioned place, and all being present, I notified them of the decree; I took them by the hand, walked with them over the land; they cried out, pulled up weeds, threw stones, as required by law; and having placed the new settlers in possession of said lands, I gave them the title and vocation they should have in the settlement, which bears the name aforementioned. . . . And the first proceedings having been noted, I proceeded to establish the boundaries as contained in the first petition . . . at which principal boundaries I ordered them to perpetuate their existence with permanent land marks, pointing out tb them also, as a means of good economy, their common pastures, water and watering places, and uses and customs for all, to be the same without dispute, with the condition that each one is to use the same without dispute, in equal portions, the richest as well as the poorest; and by virtue of what has been ordered, I pronounce this royal possession as sufficient title for themselves, their children, heirs and successors, to hold their lands now and forever at their will; directing them, as I do direct them, to settle the same within the time prescribed by the royal ordinances: and for their greater quietude, peace, tranquility and harmony, I proceeded to point out the land each family should cultivate, each one receiving in length a sufficient quantity to plant one fanega of corn, two of wheat, garden and house lot, as follows:" Here follow nineteen names of original

petitioner's as given allotments of land, the name M!anuel Carrillo appearing twice. Ten of the petitioners were not allotted lands, and among those who obtained allotments were five who were not petitioners.
It is unnecessary to discuss at length the question whether the grant made in 1739 passed a title to the persons therein named to the whole tract, or whether this was merely a grant in severalty of the lands allotted to the
persons named in the report showing jUridical possession, leaving title to the unallotted lands in the Crown, to be allotted to future settlers. Examination shows that the petition, decree and report, of juridical possession are in form substantially like those-in United Slates v. Saidoval, 167 U. S. 278, wherein the effect, of such instruments is discussed at length. See also United States v. Santa Fe, 165 U. S. 675; Rio Arriba &c. Co. v. United States, 167 U. S.298; UnitedStales v. Pena, 175 U. 8. 500.
The fact that the governor made the grant "to be without prohibition to anyone desiring to settle the same," that the juridical possession was to be by "giving in all cases to each one the portion he may be entitled to," and that juridical possession and allotment of land was made to persons not petitioning -in, the theory of the plaintiffs, not beneficiaries of the decree-while no land was allotted to ten of the petitioners, who, according to the same theory, were beneficiaries, is not explicable on any other theory than that the grant was communal, in which settlers and no others could by allotments obtain individual, several interests. On this construction the omission of allotments to petitioners not identifying themselves with the new settlement would be the necessary consequence,
as also would be the allottments to new settlers who were not petitioners.
Had the matter stopped there-had no grant been made' by Congress--the grant must have been effective only as to the lands allotted in several right to those named in

Opinion of the Court.

the report of juridical possession. Title to and power of disposal over the residue of the land remained- in, the Crown and. passed to the United States upon the acquisition of the territory.
There.was, however, Congressional confirmation of the grant. In 1856 the inhabitants of Tom6 petitioned -the sirveyor-general for New Mlexico for confirmation of the grant to the town, conformably to the act of July 22, 15, 10 Stat. 308, c. 103. It was so confirmed by the act
of December 22, 1858, 11 Stat. 374, e.5; and, April 5, 1871., patent issued to the town of Tom6. It is said that the legal title so passed is subject to a trust for the heirs of the original petitioners, who, it is claimed, were beneficiaries of the decree of the Spanish governor. in 1.739.
As no benefit of that decree, and no title to any of the land, passed to any of the petitioners save those to whom allotments were made, and only to the allotted tracts, no further discussion is necessary. When patent to the entire grant issued to the town of Torn6, title to all the unallotted land passed from the United States to the town unburdened with any trust for heirs or grantees of persons named in the original petition and decree.

Wlhile one may not by his own act preserve to himself the enjoyment of his own property in such manner that it shall not be subject to claims of creditors or to his own power of alienation, a testator may bestow his own property in that manner upon one to whom he wishes to secure beneficial enjoyment without being subject to the claims of assignees or creditors.

liability to creditors and freedom of alienation are necessary incidents to efijoying the rents and profits from the property by the object of bounty of a testator. One of the highest duties resting upon a court is to carry out the intentions of a testator as expressed in valid provisions not repugnant to well settled principles of public policy. In this case the court refuses to compel testamentary trustees to pay over legacies prior to the time specified in the Will although the property bequeathed had vested in the legatees. 36 App. D. C. 1, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the validity of a testamentary trust and the right of the beneficiaries to have the same terminated prior to the time fixed by the will, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Henry F. Woodard, with whom Mr. Arthur A. Birney was on the brief, for appellants:
Appellants took a vested and fixed interest in their legacies, and the attempt to postpone the time for the enjoyment of the same is inconsistent with their ownership, contrary to public policy, and a restraint on the power of their free disposition or alienation,'and is, therefore, void. As no other person claims any interest in the legacies appellants may rightfully waive the provision made for their benefit and have the fund paid to them at this time.
It is agreed that the legacies give appellants a vested interest in the moneys bequeathed, so that the only point in controversy is when the fund is to be paid over. Johnson v. Washington L. & T. Co., 224 U. S. 224; McArthur v. Scott, 113 U. S. 340, 380.
Appellants took a vested and indefeasible interest in their legacies and by no known process of human laws could they be defeated in the enjoyment of the same. Rector v. Dalby, 98 Mo. App. 189.
The will makes no provision with reference to the income or accumulations. It is merely a dry, naked trust.

The fund is not given to the trustees to be by them held, but the gifts are to the children. The only function of the trustee is to lock the fund up and keep the legatees from any participation therein until the youngest reaches the
age of 25. The law is that a trust such as it was attempted to es-
tablish in this case is void, or if not void, voidable. For the English rule see Saunders v. Vautier, 4 Beav. Rep. 115; Wharton v. Masterman, App. Cas., 1895, H. of L., p. 186; Josslyn v.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE LURTON delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a bill to terminate a trust under the will of Anna Smith Mallett. The material clauses are in these wo"r3d.s: I give, bequeath and devise to Jean Louisa, Anna Gertrude, and Robert Philo Shelton, being the children of my cousin John Consider Shelton, deceased, all of Bridgeport, Connecticut: the sum of Seventy-five Thousand dollars, being Twenty-five Thousand to each.

Codicil.

"In addition to Frank B. King, whom I have appointed
executor of this, my last will and testament, I wish to appoint Win. H. Saunders, of the firm of Win. H. Saunders & Co., 1407 F Street, Northwest, and George W. White, Paying Teller of the National Metropolitan Bank, co-
trustees with the said F. B. King,-to hold in trust the legacies devised to Jean Louisa, Anna Gettrude and
Robert Philo Shelton,-said trusteeship to terminate when these legatees shall receive their portions of my estate.
"And it is my further will that these legacies to the said Jean Louisa, Anna' Gertrude, and Robert Philo Shelton, shall be paid in fill when the said Robert Philo Shelton shall reach the age of twenty-five years."
The complainants are the three legatees, Jean L. Shelton, now more than twenty-one years of age, and Anna

tees was not born until 1896, the bill is premature by many years, if the trust created by the codicil is to be regarded.
That th6 respective legacies are vested and absolute
is undeniable. No other person has any interest in them, and if the trustees should disregard the time of payment and pay over to each legatee his or her legacy when they are competent to give a valid discharge, there would be no one who could call them to account. But the trustees, having regard for the express wish of the testatrix, have refused to terminate the trust, and the object of this proceeding is to compel them to pay over the shares of the legatees as they reach the age of twenty-one years..
The objects of the bounty of the testatrix were distant kinspeople. Besides their postponed legacies they were given the residuum of the estate. What that was does not appear. It is not claimed that they are in want, nor that anything has happened since the will which was not anticipated by the testatrix, and no special reasons are claimed for terminating the trust because of new conditions which she did not take into account. In Sears v. Choate, 146 Massachusetts, 395, a situation arose after the will, which the court thought had not been contemplated by the testator, and for which no provision had been made. The court therefore saw in that a reason for terminating
a like trust. In the case at bar no ground, aside from the alleged illegality of the trust, is suggested for defeating the wishes of Miss Mallett other than that it will be convenient and will save the cost of continuing the trust.
The trust is not dry, but is active, and must continue, if not invalid, until the time of payment arrives. Upon what principle, then, is a court of equity to control the trustee by compelling a premature payment? It is a settled principle that trustees having the power to exercise discretion will not be interfered with so long as they axe acting bona fide. To do so would be to substitute

SHELTON v. KING.

229 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

the discretion of the court for that of the trustee. Upon the same and even stronger grounds a court of equity will not undertake to control them in Violation of the wishes of the testator. To do that would be to substitute the will of the chancellor for that.of the testator. Lewin on Trusts, 2nd Am. Ed. 448; Nichols v. Eaton, 91 U. S. 716, 724.
There being in this case no ground for saying that there have arisen circumstances and conditions for which the testatrix made no provision, we may not control the trustee, if the postponement directed by the will does not offend against some principle of positive law or settled rule of public policy.
There is no pretense of perpetuity. Creditors are in no way concerned. If the testatrix saw fit to have this fund accumulate in the hands of trustees and thereby postpone the enjoyment of her gift, why shall her will be disregarded? The restriction she imposed may protect her bounty against ill-advised investments and waste or extravagance. She did not undertake to guard against alienation, except in so fai as the alienors will take subject to the same postponement of payment. Slier v. Nashville Trust Co., 158 Fed. Rep. 601. Nor did she undertake to protect against creditors as in Nichols v. Eaton, 91 U. S. 716. The single restriction she imposed upon her gift was that the legacies should not be paid until the time named, and in the meantime should be held in trust.
The appellants contend that whether the trust be active or dry, it is one for the benefit of the legatees, and, as no other person has any interest in the legacies, may be waived by them. For this they cite Saunders v. Vautier, 4 Beavan's Reports, 115, and Wharton v. Masterman, Appeal Cases, 1895, pp. 186, 193. In Saunders v. Vautier it was laid down, without argument, that "where a legacy is directed to accumulate for a certain period, or where

229 U. S.

the payment is postponed, the legatee, if he has an absolute indefeasible interest in the legacy, is not bound to wait until the expiration of that period, but may require payment the moment he is competent to give a valid discharge.". The point thus.decided in Saunders v. Vautier was followed in Wharton v. Masterman, where Lord Herschell said very significantly, "The point seems, in the first instance,, to have been rather assumed than decided. It was apparently regarded as a necessary consequence of the conclusion that a gift had vested, that the enjoyment of it must be immediate on the beneficiary
becoming sui juris, and could not be postponed until a later date unless the testator had made some other destination of the income during the intervening period.
"It is needless to inquire whether the courts might have given effect to the intention of the testator in such cases to postpone the enjoyment of his bounty to a time fixed by himself subsequent to the attainment by the objects of his bounty of their majority. The doctrine has been so long settled and so often recognized that it
would not be proper now to question it." The doctrine thus stated is the plain outgrowth of
certain earlier English decisions in the interest of creditors, which hold, in substance, that the necessary incidents of beneficial ownership in property are liability to creditors
and the power of alienation. Having concluded that a testator could not so bestow that which was his own to an object of his bounty as not to be subject to the claims of creditors of the latter, it was a logical conclusion that a testator could not postpone the payment of a vested and absolute legacy beyond the time when the legatee
should be able to give a valid discharge. But the acceptance of the principle upon which Saunders v. Vautier and Wharton v. Masterman rest involves the acceptance of the limitation which the earlier English cases place
upon the powers of a testator in so disposing of his prop-

SHELTON tr. XING.

229 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

erty that it may be enjoyed by the recipient without liability to creditors. The foundation of the English doctrine in both classes of cases is an assumption that there is some settled principle of public policy which subjects all property in which one has a beneficial ownership to the claims of creditors and forbids restraint upon alienation. That this theory of public policy is not of universal application, at least in this country, is manifest from the numerous exemption statutes existing which protect to a limited extent the acquisitions of a debtor from the claims of his creditors and restrain his power of alienation in the interest of his family. Neither do we for a moment question the rule that one may not by his own act preserve to himself the enjoyment of property in such manner that it shall not be subject to the claims of creditors or placed beyond his own power of alienation.
But a very different question is presented when we come to the powers of a testator to so bestow that which is absolutely his own as to secure its beneficial enjoyment by an object of his bounty without being subject to the claims of assignees or creditors. This court,' and the courts of a number of the States of the Union, have not accepted the limitation which the English courts have placed upon the right of testamentary disposition, and have sustained trusts having as an object the application of a testator's bequest to the support and maintenance of the recipient of his bounty. They have, therefore, rejected the assumption that liability to creditors and freedom of alienation are necessary incidents to the right to enjoy the rents and profits of real estate, or the income from other property.
In the leading case of Nichols v. Eaton, 91 U. S. 716, 725, Mr. Justice Miller, speaking the unanimous voice of this court, said of the English doctrine to which we have referred, and upon which Saunders v. Vautier must in- principle rest:
VOL. ccxxjx-7

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.

Opinion of the Court.

229 U. S.

"We do not see, as implied in the remark of Lord Eldon, that the power of alienation is a necessary incident to a life estate in real property, or that the rents and profits of real property and the interest and dividends of personal property may not be enjoyed by an individual without liability for his debts being attached as a necessary incident, to such enjoyment. This doctrine is one which the English Chancery Court has ingrafted upon the common law for the benefit of creditors, and is comparatively of modern origin. We concede that there are limitations which public policy or general statutes im-
pose upon all dispositions of property, such as those designed to prevent perpetuities and accumulation of real estate in corporations and ecclesiastical bodies. We also admit that there is a just and sound policy peculiarly appropriate to the jurisdiction of courts of equity to protect creditors against frauds upon their rights, whether they be actual or constructive frauds. But the doctrine, that the owner of property, in the free exercise of his will in disposing of it, cannot so dispose of it, but that the object of his bounty, who parts with nothing in return, must hold itsubject to the debts due his creditors, though that may soon deprive him of all the benefits' sought to be conferred by the testator's affection or generosity, is one which we are not prepared to announce as the doctrine of this court."
Touching the theory that public policy forbids restraints upon the disposition of a testator's bounty, the court said (p. 727):
"Nor do we see any reason, -in the recognized nature and tenure of property and its transfer by will, why a testator who gives, who gives without any pecuniary return, who gets nothing of property value from the donee, may not attach to that gift the incident of continued use, of uninterrupted benefit of the gift, during the life of the donee.

and wishes to use his own property in securing the object of his affection, as far as property can do it, from the ills of life, the vicissitudes of fortune, and even his own improvidence, or incapacity for self-protection, should not be permitted to do so, is not readily perceived."
In Hyde v. Woods, 94 U. S. 523, 526, this court said of
Nichols v. Eaton, supra: "In that case, the mother of the bankrupt, Eaton, had
bequeathed to him by will the income of a fund, with a condition in the trust that on his bankruptcy or insolvency the legacy should cease and go to his wife or children, if he had any, and if not, it should lapse into the general fund of the testator's estate, and be subject to other dispositions. The assignee of the bankrupt sued to recover the interest bequeathed to the bankrupt, on the ground that this condition was void as against public
policy. "But this court, on a full examination of the authori-
ties, both in England and this country, held that the objection was not well taken; that the owner of property might make such a condition in the transfer of that which was his own, and in doing so violated no creditor's rights and no principle of public policy."
If such a trust as that upheld in Nichols v. Eaton, was not in violation of principles of public policy, it must follow that one which neither restrains creditors nor alienation is not. If that case is to stand the decree of the court below was right.
The principle upon which Nichols v. Eaton stands is in line with the views of a number of other courts. Many of them are cited in that opinion, and to those we add: Broadway National Bank v. Adams, 133 Massachusetts, 170; Mason v. Rhode Island HosXi~al Trust Co., 78 Con-
necticut, 81; Jourolmon v. Massengvll, 86 Tennessee, 81; Henson v. Wright, 88 Tennessee, 501; Brooks v. Raynolds, 59 Fed. Rep. 923; Smith v. Towers, 69 Maryland, 77-

Keyser v. Mitchell, 67 Pa. St. 473; Seymour v. McAvoy, 121 California, 438; Steib v. Whitehead, 111 Illinois, 247; Wallace v. Campbell & Maxey, 53 Texas, 229; Garlandv. Garland, 87 Virginia, 758; Lampert v. Haydel, 96 Mis-
souri, 439. Claflin v. Claflin, 149 Massachusetts, 19, was a case,
on its facts, like the case at bar. The testator gave the residue of his estate to trustees in trust to sell and dispose of as follows: Ten thousand dollars to a son when of age; a like sum when he reached twenty-five years, and the balance when he should reach the age of thirty years. When the son reached the age of twenty-one the trustee paid him ten thousand dollars, and thereupon he filed a bill in equity to obtain the whole of the fund. The Massachusetts court held the trust valid and dismissed the bill. Referring to Broadway Bank v. Adams, supra, where a trust for support and maintenance had been upheld against creditors, the court said:
"The decision in Broadway National Bank v. Adams, 133 Massachusetts, 170, rests upon the doctrine that a testator has a right to dispose of his own property with such restrictions and limitations, not repugnant to law, as he sees fit, and that his intentions ought to be carried out unless they contravene some positive rule of law, or are against public policy. The rule contended for by the plaintiff in that case was founded upon the same considerations as that contended for by the plaintiff in this; and the grounds on which this court declined to follow the English rule in that case are applicable tothis; and for the reasons there given we are unable to see that the directions of the testator to the trustees to pay the money to the plaintiff when he reached the age of twenty-five and thirty years, and not-before, are against public policy, or are so far inconsistent with the rights of property given to the plaintiff that they should not be carried into effect. It iannot be said that these restrictions upon the

SHELTON v. KING.

229 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

plaintiff's possession and control of the property are altogether useless, for there is not the same danger that he will spend the property while it is in the hands of the trustees, as there would be if it were in his own."
Stier v. Nashville Trust Co., decided by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, 158 Fed. Rep. 601, is also directly in point.
The case of Sears v. Choate, 146 Massachusetts, 395, has been cited as in conflict With Claflin v. Claflin. It is not. In the former case it appeared that there had occurred circumstances which the testator had not contemplated, on account of which the court saw no reason for not terminating the trust. The case was distinguished in Claflin
v. Claflin. In the case at bar nothing has happened since the will
which was not anticipated by the testatrix. The case falls, therefore, precisely within the later case of Claflin v. Claflin. There is no reason for declaring the trust invalid. There is no higher duty which rests upon a court than to carry out' the intentions of a testator when the provision is not repugnant to settled principles of public policy and is otherwise valid.
Decree affirmed.

OCHOA v. HERNANDEZ. Syllabus.

OCHOA v. HERNANDEZ Y MORALES.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR PORTO RICO.
No. 92. Submitted December 17, 1912.-Decided June 16, 1913.
Under § 35 of the Foraker Act, appeals from the District Court of the United States for Porto Rico are subject to the provisions applicable to appeals from the Supreme Courts of the Territories under thq act of April 7, 1874, under which the jurisdiction of this court is confined, in a case where there are no errors assigned upon questions of evidence, to determining whether the findings of the court below support the judgment. Rosaly v. Graham, 227 U. S. 584.
Even if the 'commanding officer in territory occupied by military forces of the United States has all the legislative power as to such territory possessed by Congress, he is still subject, as Congress is, to the provisions of the Fifth Amendment and cannot by military orders deprive persons of their property without due process of law.
To shorten the period for acquisition of title by prescription and give the order a retroactive effect so that the period has elapsed at the time the order is made without giving those who have interests in the property an opportunity to be heard and saving no existing rights, amounts to taking Oroperty without due process of law.
The provision in the judicial order of Gefieral Henry published April 7, 1899, during the military occupationof Porto Rico by the United States, reducing the period for prescriptive title to real estate in that island from the periods previously established by law down to six years with retroactive effect and without any opportunity for third parties to be heard, amounted to a deprivation' of property of the actual owners without due process of law and was beyond the power of the Military Governor; nor was this provision ratified by any subsequent action of Congress.
The status of Porto Rico during the military occupancy and before the exchange of ratifications of the treaty of peace, was the same as that of the Philippine Islands during the same period.
Fron the exchange of ratifications -until Congress acted by the passage of the F6raker Act the provisional government established inPorto Rico continued as before the peace.

reiterated mutatis mutandi as to Porto Rico by General Miles continued in force as the recognized declaration of principles by which the Military Government was limited, and under this the Governor was without authority to make any order that would deprive any person of his property without due process of law. While the exact definition of the term "due process of law" may be uncertain, it is certain that it inhibits the taking of one man's property and giving it to another, contrary to settled usages and modes of procedure, and without notice or an opportunity to be heard. Statutes of limitation may be modified by shortening the time which is still running but only so that a reasonable time still remains for commencement of an action before the bar takes effect. Wherever registry laws are in force, the rule is that a purchaser takes subject to any defects and infirmities that may be ascertained by reference to the chain of title as spread on the record, and this includes invalidity of an order on which title is based. Under the registry law of Porto Rico rights of third parties were preserved and a mortgagee or grantee acquired no better right before the expiration of the period of prescription than the grantor, but took subject to the rights of infants who owned property the title to which had been fraudulently registered in the name of the grantor. Where the limitations on a person exercising authority are notorious and are simply in accord with national and international law, there is no hardship in applying the rule that rights cannot be acquired under orders made by such person which are wholly beyond his authority. 5 Porto Rico Fed. Rep. 463, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the title to real estate in Porto Rico and the constitutionality of certain military orders during the military occupation of that Island, are stated in the opinion.

Mr. T. D. Mott, Jr., for appellants:
The Judicial Order of April 4, 1899,-is not unconstitu-
tional nor is it repugnant to Art. V of, or the Fourteenth Amendment to, the Constitution of the United States.
Paragraph 3 of the Judicial Order is no-t a statute of limitations properly so called. It cut off no right of action on the part of anyone. In the present case it permitted appellants' grantor to convert His possessory into a dominio

title to the land in dispute and record the same. In no way did it affect the rights of appellees.
The conversion, though the result of judicial proceedings, did not have the effect of res judicata, and did, not bind anyone who did not appear in said proceedings. Calderon v. Gaicia, 14 P. R. Sup. Ct. 407; Gonzalez v. El Pueblo, 10 P. R. Sup. Ct. 458.
Even as to those who had so appeared and opposed the conversion sought by such proceedings, their rights could not be adjudged, or passed upon, in those proceedings, but such rights must be decided in an ordinary action of r vindication. The court is limited in such proceedings of conversion to saying whether or not the petitioifer has shown a right to the conversion asked for. It cannot pass upon the rights of others: Diaz v. Waymouth, 13 P. R. Sup. Ct. 317; Parisv. Porto Rico, 5 P. R. Sup. Ct. 29.
The alleged rights of appellees concerning the land in
question were not affected by the conversion proceedings whereby appellants' grantor converted his possessory title into a title of ownership, or dominion title. Nor did the recording of the dominio title by such grantor cut off any of the alleged rights of these appellees. If such title was fraudulent, it was liable to attack, even after registry, within any period short of thirty years, after he had entered into possession of the land and while still recorded in his name, or in that of any otler person, excepting an innocent purchaser without nv,,ice, or in the language of the civil law "a third party with good faith," Abella v. Antunano, 14 P. R. Sup. Ct. 485; Paris v. Porto Rico, 5 P. R. Sup. Ct. 29; Valdes v. Valle, 1 P. R. Sup. Ct. 75 (Span. ed.); Gonzalez v. El Pueblo, 10 P. R. Sup. Ct. 458.
As appellees could have exercised their right of action against appellants' grantor after the latter had converted his possessory title into a title of dominion and had recorded~such title, and the exercise by appellces of such -right of action was as ample and full after the recording

142 '

230 U. S.

of such dominion title as it was before such record, paragraph 3 did not cut off any supposed right of appellees, and therefore does not violate the provisions of Art. V of, or the Fourteenth Amendment to, the Constitution of the
United States. Paragraph 3 of the aforesaid Judicial Order, which pro-
vides for the conversion of entries of possession into records of ownership, is in no sense a statute of limitation. But, even if it be so considered, it took away no remedy which these appellees possessed before its passage. A statute of limitation which takes away no remedy which the lahdowner had before its passage is not unconstitutional and is valid. Turner v. New York, 168,U. S. 90; SaranacLand Co. v. New York, 177 U. S. 318.
The Judicial Order of April 4, 1899, has been enforced in many cases by the Supreme Court of Porto Rico, although in such cases its validity or constitutionality was not questioned or involved. Ex partePinto, 6 P. R1.Sup. Ct. 149; Ex parte Martinez, 6 P. R. Sup. Ct. 169; Ex parte Miner, 6 P. R. Sup. Ct. 261; Ex parte Sanfeliz, 6 P. R. Sup. Ct. 501;.Ex parte Tarpia,6 P. R. Sup. Ct. 509; Ex parte Colzada, 6 P. R. Sup.'Ct. 531.
The provisions of Art. V of, and the Fourteenth Amendment to, the Constitution of the United States do not obtain in Porto Rico.
No. decision of this court directly determines this point, nor is there any act of Congress which has made the Constitution, or any part of the same, extensive to Porto Rico.
The Judicial Order of April 4, 1899, was a military order, promulgated during the occupancy of Porto Rico by the military forces of;te United States, so that said order was previous to the act of Congress of April 12,.1900, which act
extended civil government tQ Porto Rico, and ratified and con~firm&icaill existing laws, military orders, etc., which at that tip were in effect in Porto. Rico, with some excep-

tions, which are not pertinent to the consideration of the present case. See § 8, act of April 12, 1900.
The trial court erred in holding as matter of law that the deed to appellants whereby their grantor sold to them the lands described in the bill of complaint, is null and void, and that neither such deed nor the recording of the same in the proper registry of property conferred title upon
defendants or protected such title in them.

Mr. Hector H. Scoville and Mr. Joseph Anderson, Jr., for appellees.

MR. JusTIc PITNEY delivered the opinion of the court.

This was a suit in equity to establish the right of the
complainants (appellees) to a parcel of land containing 106 acres, situate in the Barrio Nuevo, in the Jurisdiction of Naranjito, in the Island of Porto Rico, found to exceed in
value the sum of $5,000. The District Court decreed that the complainants were the legal owners of this land by inheritance, and entitled to the possession of it as against
the appellants, a firm doing business under the name of J. Ochoa y Hermano; that the firm should deliver posses-
sion to the appellees; that all entries in the registry of property, of "dominio" and "posesorio" title by or in favor of that firm, and all other entries of either kind of
title as against the appellees, should be canceled, etc. 5 P. R. Fed. Rep. 463. Defendants appealed to this court.
At the time the appeal was taken, § 35 of the act of April 12, 1900, known as the Foraker Act (31 Stat. 77, 85, e. 191), was in force-since superseded by § 244 of the Judicial Code of March 3, 1911, 26 Stat. 1087, 1157, c. 231,-and subjected appeals from the District Court of the
United States for Porto Rico to the regulations applicable to appeals from the Supreme Courts of the Territories.
These were controlled by act of April 7, 1874, c. 80, § 2,

OCTOBER TERM, 1912. Opinion of the Court.

18 Stat. 27, 28, by which it was provided that instead of the evidence at large, a statement of the facts in the nature of a special verdict, with the rulings of the court on the admission or rejection of evidence when excepted to, should be made and certified by the court below, and transmitted to this court with the transcript of the proceedings and judgment or decree. Our jurisdiction therefore is confined to determining whether the facts found by the District Court support its judgment; for no errors are assigned upon questions of evidence. Rosaly v. Graham, 227U. S. 584, 590, and cases cited.
The findings are in substance as follows: Jose Maria Hernandez, the paternal grandfather of complainants, was at the time of his death in the year 1872, the owner and in possession of a tract of land in which was included the parcel of 106 acres in controversy. His title to this parcel was never recorded. Upon his death his son, Juan Hernandez, became by inheritance the owner of it, and entered into and remained in possession as owner until his death, which occurred in the year 1887; but his title was never recorded. Upon his death, Juan Hernandez left surviving him *twoyoung children, the ,complainants, and also a widow,ltheir mother; she died in the year 1906, and the complainants, then still minors, became sdle owners of the tract by inheritance from their father; but their title has never been recorded.
In the year 1890, the title to the land in question did not appear of record in favor of any person, either in the books of the present or modern registry, or in the books of the old registry, -the ancient "anotadurias" or "contadurias." In that year Raimundo Morales, the maternal grandfather of the complainants, fraudulently representing hiinself to be the owner, appeared before the municipal court of Naranjito, an Insular court, and by certain ex parte proceedings obtai)ed from that court a decree declaring him to be entitled to the possession of the land,

OCHOA v. HERNANDEZ.

230 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

but without prejudice to third parties who might show a better right to such possession. The possessory title so obtained was duly recorded or inscribed in the proper
registry of property, in the same year, and was the only title to the land that then appeared recorded or inscribed in the registry.
In the year 1899, Morales again appeared before the same Insular court and petitioned for a decree converting the possessory title, or entry of possession in the registry, into a record of ownership (titulode dominio). His petition and the proceedings had thereon in the Insular court were based upon the provisions of a Judicial Order, dated
April 4, 1899, and promulgated in the Official Gazette of Porto Rico under date April 7, 1899. This order was made ander authority of Major-General Guy V. Henry, U. S. Volunteers, at that time Military Governor of Porto Rico, and by its terms reduced from twenty years to six years f he period during which real estate must be held in order
to permit the conversion in the registry of a posesorio title to a dominio title. Upon the application of Morales, such proceedings were had in the Insular court as were provided for in the Judicial Order, and the court in due time made and entered its decree to the effect that the entry of possession, or possessory title which appeared in the registry recorded in favor of Morales,, be converted into a record Of ownership or dominio title. Thereafter, and in the same year (1899), this decree was duly recorded or' inscribed by Morales in the proper registry of title, and the dorninio title thereafter appeared in the registry recorded solely in his name.
In the year 1901, there appearing in the registry no claim or right or title in the land on the part of any other person or persons, Morales, still frabdulently representing himself to be the true owner, mortgaged the land for value to the defendants, constituting the firm of J. Ochoa y Ilermnano, who truly and in good faith believed him (Mo-

230 U. S.

rales) to be the owner of it, and were entirely ignorant of the rights of the complainants therein. The mortgage was duly recorded in the proper registry of property in the same year.
Thereafter, and in the year 1903, the record still showing nothing respecting the ownership of the lands besides the dominio title of Morales and the mortgage of the defendants, and they being still ignorant of the rights of the complainants, Morales by deed duly executed before a notary public, in which his wife joined, sold and transferred the land to defendants in full payment of the amounts due and secured by the mortgage. The defendants duly recorded the deed in the same year, and by their agent immediately took possession of the land.
The present action was commenced in 1908, shortly after the complainants arrived at full age.
Upon these facts the District Court concluded as matter of law that the Judicial Order of General Henry, dated April 4, 1899-so far as it operated retrospectively upon the rights of the complainants, who were minors at the time and for some time thereafter, and who owned the land during the entire period of nine years that elapsed between the fraudulent entry of possessory title in the name of their maternal grandfather, Morales, and the promulgation of General Henry's order-was null and void because in contravention of the "due process of law" clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States,
For an understanding of the questions presented, it should be premised that Congress declared war to exist between this country and Spain by act of April 25, 1898, 30 Stat. 364, ch. 189; that Porto Rico, then a colony of Spain, was occupied by the military forces of the United States from and after July 25; that a protocol was signed in Washington, August 12 (30 Stat. 1742),
under which hostilities between the two countries were

Opinion of the Court.

suspended pending negotiation of a treaty for the establishment of peace, by the terms of which protocol (inter alia) Spain agreed to cede the Island of Poito Rico to the United States and to immediately evacuate it, and commissioners were appointed to meet at Paris and proceed to the negotiation and conclusion of the treaty; that accordingly a treaty was signed at Paris under date December 10, 1898, ratifications being exchanged at Washington, April 11, 1899 (30 Stat. 1754), and by its terms, Porto Rico was ceded to the United States, and (Article IX, p. 1759) "The civil rights and political status of the native inhabitants of the territories hereby ceded to the United States shall be determined by the Congress." The military occupation of Porto Rico was immediately followed by the establishment of a provisional government, as will be mentioned below, and this government continued in control of the affairs of the Island continuously until the ratification of the Treaty, and thereafter until the enactment of the Foraker Act of April 12, 1900, entitled "An act temporarily to provide revenues and a civil government for Porto Rico, and for other purposes" (31 Stat. 77, c. 191).
The statement of facts is silent upon the question of the possession of the property from the death of the father of the appellees in the year 1887 until the appellants entered into possession under the deed given to them by Morales in the year 1903. Assuming (in favor of appellants) that Morales had possession from the time he procured the entry of a possessory title in his name, the effect of this, as between him and the true owners, was that uninterrupted possession for 30 years would ripen into a good title and confer immunity from action (former Civil Code P. R., Articles 1959, 1963, New Civil Code, P. R., §§ 1860, 1864). He was not entitled to avail himself of Article 1957, that declared a'prescription by possessioh for ten years as to persons present, and for twenty

years with regard to those :absent, because this was confind to possession "with good faith and proper title;" and Morales had neither, within the meaning of those terms as employed in the Code (Former Civil Code P. R., Arts. 1940, 1941, 1950, 1952, 1953, 1954; present Civil Code, §§ 1841, 1842, 1851, 1853, 1854, 1855). The entry of a possessory title in his name was in effect a judicial certificate declaring him to be entitled to the possession, but without prejudice to third parties, who might show a better right to it. It gave him no title as against them, but conferred a primafacie legitimacy upon his possession, being "provisional and presumptive evidence of ownership;" and it fixed a date from which his possession should be treated as originating; and so the entry amounted (for present purposes) to no more than public notice that from that time his possession was adverse to the true owners. Soto v. Registrar of Property, 15 P. R. Sup. Ct. 597, 600; Morales v. Landrau, 15 P. R. Sup. Ct. 761, 772; Paresv. J. Reynes & Co., 2 P. R. Fed. 402, 428.
But appellants rest their case upon the provisions of the Mortgage Law, as amended by the judicial order of General Henry. 4The Mortgage Law is a somewhat elaborate system of registration for instruments of conveyance that, having been long in force in the Peninsula, was extended to Porto Rico and the Philippines in or about the year 1893. It was designed to give to purchasers and mortgagees, acquiring interests in lands in reliance upon recorded titles, protection against claims and in-
terests of which no notice was conveyed by the records. Its provisions are to be read in connection with those of the Civil Code. By Art. 27, "Those who have not participated in the recorded instrument or contract" are considered as third persons. By Art. 33, "The record of instruments or contracts which are null in accordance with the law are not validated thereby." But, notwithstanding this, by Art. 34, "Instruments or contracts

230 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

executed or covenanted by a person who, according to the Registry, has a right thereto, shall not be invalidated with regard to third persons, after they have once. been recorded, although later the right of the person executing them is annulled or determined by virtue of a prior deed not recorded, or for reasons which do not clearly appear from the Registry. Only by virtue of a recorded instrument may another later instrument, also recorded, be invalidated to the prejudice of third persons,, [with exceptions not now material.] The provisions of this Article
[341 may at no time be applied to the instrument recorded in accordance with the provisions of Article 390, unless the prescription has validated or secured the interest referred to therein." By Art. 36, "Suits for rescission or determination of title shall not be instituted against third persons who have recorded the instruments of their respective interests in conformity with the provisions of this law." But by Art. 37 exceptions are made to the rule thus declared, and one of them is-"Suits for rescission or determination of title which are due to the causes plainly expressed in the Registry."
Subsequent sections provide for the mortgaging of different interests in real property, and for various purposes, and declare the effect that shall be given to the mortgages, provide for the manner of keeping the registries, for making and correcting entries therein, and for proceedings for clearing the title of unrecorded mortgages and other charges and interests. Art. 389 prohibits the admission in the courts, etc., of uirecorded documents or instruments if presented for the purpose of enforcing, to the prejudice of third persons, interests which should have been recorded. Aricles 390 to 395 inclusive contain provisions under which owners who lack a recorded title of ownership are permitted to record their interests by previously proving their possession before the Judge of First Instance, or the proper MNuniepal Judge, with

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.

the consent of the fDepartment of Public Prosecution and citation of the adjacent property owners, should they desire to record, the absolute ownership of some estate, and with the citation of the owner or other participants in the ownership, should they desire to record some property right. Article 391 prescribes the form-of the .proceedings. Article 392 provides that the court, on approving the proceedings, shall "order that the record requested be made in the Registry without prejudice to a third person having a better claim." Among the prerequisites for converting entries of possession into records of ownership under this procedure it was, by par. 6 of Art. 393, provided that twenty years must have elapsed since the date of entry of possession. By Art. 394-"If the twenty years calculated from the date of the entry [of possession] have not elapsed, or the requisites mentioned in Article 393 of this law have not been- complied with, the entries of possession shall have the legal effect embraced in the provisions contained in the following paragraphs, [viz]. The period of possession which appears to have elapsed at the time said entries are made shall be computed for the prescription which does not require a just title, unless a person prejudiced thereby denies it, in which case said period of possession must be proved in accordance with the common law. Entries of possession shall prejudice or favor third persons from the date of their record, but only with regard to the effects which the laws attribute to mere possession. The entry of possession shall not prejudice the person who has a better right to the ownership of the realty, although his title has not been recorded, unless the prescription has confirmed and secured the claim recorded. Between the parties the possession shall be effectual from the date prescribed by the common law. The provisions contained in the preceding Articles, regarding the entries of possession, can not be applied to mortgage rights, which can

Opinion of the Court.

not be recorded unless an instrument in writing is pre-
sented." Under the Mortgage Law, it seems to be settled that
there proceedings for proving possession or ownership before the courts of first instance or municipal courts, although judicial in form, are intended merely as aids to the establishment of a system of authenticated instruments of title for purposes of the ,public records; that although under some circumstances it is required that notice be given to the owner or other persons interested adversely to the applicant, the proceedings are really ex parte, have not the effect of res judicata, and do not bind any one who does not appear. Gonzalez v. The People, 10 P. R. Sup. Ct. 458; Calderonv. Garcia,14 P. R. Sup. Ct. 407, 416.' And even with respect to a party who appears and opposes the entry of a possessory title or its conversion into a dominio title, his rights can not be adjudged or passed upon in these proceedings, but must be decided in an ordinary action of revindication; the
court being limited, in the proceedings under the Mortgage Law for a conversion of a possessory to a dominio title, to saying whether petitioner has shown a right to the conversion asked for; but without passing upon the rights of others. Parisv. The People, 5 P. R. Sup. Ct. 29; Diaz v. Waymouth, 13 P. R. Sup. Ct. 317.
This is conceded by the appellants, who, indeed, base
their argument upon it; contending, further, that, because of what has just been said, the rights of appellees in the land in question were not affected by the proceedings whereby Morales converted his possessory title into a title of ownership, and that the recording of this dominio title by him did not cut off any of their rights; that if such title was fraudulent it was liable to attack, even after registry, within any period short of thirty yearq after he had entered into possession of the land and while still recorded in his name, or in that of any other person

excepting an innocent purchaser without notice; or, in the
language of the civil law, "a third party with good faith." Paris v. The People, 5 P. R. Sup. Ct. 29, 37; Gonzalez v. The People, 10 P. R. Sup. Ct. 458, 462; Abella v. Antunano, 14 P. R. Sup. Ct. 485, 494; Merchant v. Lafuente, 5 Phil.

under the law of Porto Rico it was not the conversion of the apparent title of Morales from a possessory to a dominio title that cut off the rights of the appellees; but it was the fact that the appellants, in reliance upon that apparent title, and (as is said) without notice of the rights of the appellees, purchased the. land from Morales, which by virtue of the Mortgage Law gave to them a better right than the appellees. And from this it is contended that the, Judicial Order, in reducing from twenty years to six yeanr the time that must elapse between the entry of a possessory title and its conversion into a dominio title, did not cut off any right of appellees, and therefore was not and is not inconsistent with "due process of law."
But it seems'to us that there can be no difference in principle-so far as concerns the question whether the property of the appellees was taken from them without due process-whether there were two steps or 'three steps in the course of procedure by which the end was accomplished. Whether the retroactive effect of the Judicial Order resulted in conferring upon Morales a title that he himself could maintain against the true owners, or whether it conferred upon him an apparent title that not he himself but jis grantees could maintain, makes no difference in a controversy between his grantees and the true owners.
In short, the position of appellees is that by the fraudulent cionduct of Morales, plus the Mortgage Law, plus he Judicial Order, plus the douinio title in Morales founded thereon, and-the recording thereof, plus the

mortgage and deed to-appellants, their property has been taken from them and given to appellants, without notice to them or an opportunity for a hearing; and that the proceedings in court for converting the possessory into a dominion title, while bearing the semblance of judicial proceedingsi departed therefrom in the essentials. To this, it is no answer to say that those proceedings in, court did not, under the Mortgage Law, purport to be judicial proceedings at all; nor to say that they would have done no harm except for the subsequent conveyance by Morales to the appellants.
We proceed, therefore, to consider the fundamental question upon which the court below rested its decree.
The Judicial Order of General Henry, dated April 4', and published April 7, 1899 (Mil. Ord. Porto Rico, vol. 2, p. 71), contains seven clauses or paragraphs, of which the first amends Art. 1957 of the Civil Code so as to reduce the period for prescription by possession accompanied with good faith and a proper title, from ten years with respect to persons present, and twenty years with respect to persons absent, down to six years as to persons both present and absent. This has no direct bearing upon the present case, for reasons already indicated.
Other clauses of the Order amend Articles 391, 393, 394, and 395 of the Mortgage Law. The most important is that which amends paragraph 6 of Article 393, so as to reduce from twenty years to six years the period during which possession must continue in order to convert an entry of possession into a record of ownership upon the public records. The final clause declares: "This order shall have retroactive effect."
The court below held (5 P. R. Fed. Rep. 463) that, assuning General Henry possessed all the legislatiPe power that is possessed by Congress under the Constitution, he was still necessarily subject (as Congress would be) Io the

"due process of law" clause of the Fifth Amendment. And since his judicial order, because of its ret roactive clause, by its terms covered the present case, where the real owners of the land were infants and unable to protect themselves, and where they still had, under the Mortgage Law as it stood, nearly twelve years in which to attain maturity and contest the possession and right of Morales,-and since the order shortened the period of limitation to six years, which period in their case had already elapsed, the order at the same time containing no provision for saving existing rights or giving to them or to others in like situation any opportunity to assert their rights; it was the same in effect as taking their property without due process of law.
We find it unnecessary to consider whether the authority of General Henry was subject to the same constitutional limitations as that of Congress; for we have reached a like result, so far as the present case is concerned, upon different reasoning.
Porto Rico at the time was still foreign territory, and
was under a provisional military government established by President McKinley as Commander-in-Chief. In order to determine the extent bf the authority of General Henry, and the limitations upon it, we must look to the orders under which the military government was established and maintained.
The Island was occupied by the forces of the United States under Major General Miles, Commanding U. S, Army, on July 25, 1898. He appears to have had no special instructions from the President respecting the government that should be established, but it was well understood that he and those under him were subject to the instructions communicated by President McKinley to the Secretary of War under date July 13 with reference to Cuba (10 Mess. & Pap. 214), and published by the War Department as General Orders No. 101,

GENERAL ORDERS, No. 101.

WAR DEPARTMENT,
ADJUTANT GENERAL'S OFFICE,
Washington, July 18, 1898.

The following, received from the President of the United States, is published for the information and guidance of all concerned:
EXECUTIVE MANSION,
Washington, July 13, 1898. To the SECRETARY OF WAR.
SIR: The capitulation of the Spanish forces in Santiago de Cuba and in the eastern part of the Province of Santiago, and the occupation of the territory by the forces of the United States, render it necessary to instruct the military commander of the United States as to the conduct which he is to observe ,duringthe military occupation.
The first effect of the military occupation of the enemy's territory is the severance of the former political relations of the inhabitants and the establishment of a new political power. Under this changed condition of things the inhabitants,so long as they perform their duties, are entitled to security in their persons and property and in all their private rights and relations. It is my desire that the inhabitants of Cuba should be acquainted with the purpose of the United States to discharge to the fullest extent its obligations in this regard. It will therefore be the duty of the commander of the army of occupation to announce and proclaim in the most public manner that we come not to make war upon the inhabitants of Cuba, nor upon any party or faction among them, but to protect them in their homes, in their employments, and in their-personal and religious rights. All persons who, either by active aid or by honest submission, co6perate with the United States in its efforts to give effect to this beneficent purpose will receive the reward of its support and protection. Our occupation should be as free from severity as possible.
Though the powers of the military occupant are absolute and supreme and immediately operate upon the political condition of the inhabitants, the municipal laws of the conquered territory, such as affect private rights of person and property and providefor the punishment of crime, are con-

sidered as continuing in force, so far as they are compatible with the new order of things, -ntil they are suspended or superseded by the occupying belligerent and i practice they are not usually abrogated, but are allowed

The clauses especially pertinent to the present question
are the following: "The first effect of the military occupa-
tion of the enemy's territory is the severance of the former
political relations of the inhabitants and the establishment
to remain in force and to be administered by the ordinary tribunals, substantially as they were before the occupation. This enlightened practice is, so far as possible, to be adhered to on the present occasion. The judges and
the other officials connected with the administration of justice may, if they accept the supremacy of the United States, continue to administer the ordinary law of the land, as between man and man, under the supervision of the American Commander-in-Chief. The native constabulary will, so far as may be practicable, be preserved. The freedom of the people to pursue their accustomed occupations will be abridged
only when it may be necessary to do so. While the rule of conduct of theAmerican Commandcr-in-Chief will
be such as has just been defined, it will be his duty to adopt measures of a different kind, if, unfortunately, the course of the people should render such measuires indispensable to the maintenance of law and order. He will then possess the power to replace or expel the native officials in part or-altogether, to substitute new courts of his own constitution for those that now exist, or to create such new or supplementary tribunals as may be necessary. In the exercise of these high powers the commander must be guided by his judgment and his experience and a high sense of justice.
One of-the most important and most practical problems with which it will be necessary to deal is that of the treatment of property and the collection and administration of the revenues. It is conceded that all
public funds and securities belonging to the government of the country in its own right, and all arms and supplies and other movable property of such government, may be seized by the military occupant and converted to his own use. The real property of the state he may hold and administer, at the same time enjoying the revenues thereof, but he is not to destroy it save in the case of military necessity. All public means of transportation, such as telegraph lines, cables, railways and boats belonging to the state may be appropriated to his use, but unless in case of military necessity they are not to be destroyed. All churches and buildings devoted to religious worship and to the arts and sciences, all schoolhouses, are, so far as possible, to be protected, and all destruction or intentional defacement of such places, of historical monuments or archives, or of works of science or art, is prohibited, save when required by urgent military necessity.

Means o1 transportation, such as telegraph lines and cables, railways and boats, may, although they belong to private individuals or corporations, be seized by the military occupant, but unless destroyed under military necessity are not to be retained.
While it is held to be the right of the conqueror to levy contributions upon the enemy in their seaports, towns, or provinees which may be in his snilitary'posscssion by conquest and to apply the proceeds to defray the expenses of the war, this right is to be exercised within such limitations that it may not savor of confiscation As the result of military occupation the taxes and duties payable by the inhabitants to the former government become payable to the military occupant, unlcss he sees fit to substitute for them other rates or modes of contribution to the expense of the government.. The moneys so collected are to be ued for the purpose of paying the expenses of government under the military occupation, such as the salaries of the judges and the police, and for the payment of the expenses of the Army.
Private property taken for the use of the Army is to be paid for when poss ble in cash at a fai, valuation, and when payment in cash is not possible, receipts are to be given.
All ports and places in Cuba which may be in the aetual possession of our land and naval forces will be opened to the comimerce of all nieutral nations, as well as our own, in articles not contraband of war upon payment of the prescribed rates of duty which may be in force at the time of the importation.

patible with the new order of things, until they are sus-

pended or superseded by the occupying belligerent, and

in practice they are not usually abrogated, but are allowed

to remain in force and to be administered by the ordinary

General Miles was second in command only to the

President, and as his representative had full control in

Porto Rico. That he fully sympathized with the purposes

of the President, and intended that all subordinate officers

should govern themselves accordingly, appears from his

declaration to the inhabitants 'under date July 28, in

which he said: "The first effect of this occupation will be

the immediate release from your former political relations,

and it is hoped a cheerful acceptance of the government

of the United States. The chief object of the American

military forces will be to overthrow the armed authority

of Spain, and to give to the people of your beautiful island

the largest measure of liberty consistent with this military

occupation. We have not come to make war upon the

people, ,..

but, on the contrary, to bring you

protection, not only to yourselves but -to your property,

to promote your prosperity, and to bestow upon you the

immunities and blessings of the liberal institutions of our

government. It is not our purpose to interfere with any

existing laws and customs that are wholesome and bene-

ficial to your people so long as they conform to the rules

of military administration, of order and, justice. This is

not a war of devastation, but one to give to all within the

control of its military and naval forces the advantages

and blessings of enlightened civilization."

Opinion of the Court.

And under date July 29, a letter of instructions was published under the authority of General Miles for the information and guidance of all concerned, in which the substance of General Orders No. 101, mutatis mutandis, was embodied, so as to be binding upon the military governmeht of Porto Rico (Rep. War Dept. 1900, Vol. 1, Part 13, pp. 18-22).
The protocol of August 12, 1898 (30 Stat. 1742), the purport of which has already been given, left our Government, by its military forczs, in the occupation and control of Porto Rico as a colony of Spain, and bound by the principles of international law to do whatever was necessary to secure public safety, social order, and the guaranties of private property. From this time until the interchange of the ratifications of the treaty on April 11, 1899 (30 Stat. 1754), General Orders No. 101, and the instructions of General Miles to his subordinates dated July 29, 1898, continued to form the authority, and the sole authority, for the military government of Porto Rico.
This island, and the islands and keys adjacent and be-
longing to it, were by order of October 1, 1898 (General Orders No. 158), established as a military department, and Major General John R. Brooke was assigned to its command. He assumed the-command on October 18, and held it until December 8. General Henry succeeded
him on that (Tate, and remained in command until after the ratification of the treaty.
The status of Porto Rico during the military occupancy, and before the exchange of ratifications, was the same as that of the Philippines during the same period, and is dependent upon principles expounded in frequent decisions of this court. Fleming v. Paqe 9 How. 603, 614, 615; Cross v. Harrison,.16 How. 164, 190; Dooley v. United States, 182 U. S. 222, 230; MacLeod v. United States, 229 U. S. 416.

1, 174, etc. During the entire period, General Orders No. 101, as
reiterated by General Miles, continued in force as the recognized declaration of principles by which the military government was limited. References to official sources of information respecting the period of the military occupancy are given in a marginal note.'
Under all the circumstances we deem it clear that the Governor was without autfhority from the President to make any order, judicial in its nature, that would have the effect of depriving any person of his property without due process of law.
It is said that § 8 of the Foraker Act (31 Stat. 79, c. 191) had the effect of n'tifying the Judicial Order of General Henry. That s ,ction declared: "That the laws and ordinances of Porto Rico now in force shall continue in full force and eff t, except as altered, amended, ori modified hereinafter, or as altered or modified by military orders and deck C -:' in force when this act shall take effect, and so far , the same are not inconsistent or in conflict with the stU!,.tory laws of the United States not locally inapplicabie ar. the provisions hereof, until altered, amended, or repctlcd by the legislative 'authority hereinafter provided for 1-orto Rico or by Act of Congress of the United States," wnih provisos not now pertinent.

order of the Military Governor that was in excess of the authority conferred upon him by the President.
Without the guaranty of "due process" the right of private property cannot be said to exist, in the sense in which it is known to our, laws. The principle, known to the common law before Magna Charta, was embodied in that charter (Coke, 2 Inst. 45, 50), And has been recognized since the Revolution as among the safest foundations of our institutions. Whatever else may be uncertain about the definition of the term "due process of law," all authorities agree that it inhibits the taking of one man's property and giving it to another, contrary to settled usages and modes of procedure, and without notice or an opportunity for a hearing.
Now, the effect and operation of the retroactive clause in the Judicial Order of April 4, 1899, as applied to the facts of the concrete case, were such that although MIorales had until then no right, title, or interest in the land in question, and had merely established through fraudulent rnea,;s "iud withoutl notice to the persons toconied ,a. footing of possession, as a result of which, if they should permit his clains to reuiain unchallenged, and he should in fact. maintain cot'tinuous possession for nearly twelve years lorger, he would thereby be enabled to procure, by ex parte proceedings, an apparent title in himnself qs against them; yet the Order permitted him at once, and without notice to the owners, to procure such record of ownership in his nane, although they were then infants, and, so far as appears, not cognizant of his possession of the land or of any of his proceedings; and then by virtue of other provisions of the Mortgage Law, he could completely deprive them of their property if he could make sale of it to a bona fide purchaser without notice of the infirmity of his apparent title.
With reference to statutes of limitations, it is well settled that they may be modified by shortening the time

prescribed, but only if this be done while the time is still running, and so that a reasonable time still remains for the commencement of an action before the bar takes
effect. Terry v. Anderson, 95 U.S. 628, 632; In re Brown, 135 U. S. 662, 701, 705; Wheeler v. Jackson, 137 U. S. 245, 255; Turner v. New York, 168 U. S.90, 94; Wilson v. Iserninger, 185 U. S.55, 63. Many other cases might be cited. The question of what, under given circumstances, is to be deemed a reasonable time to be allowed for the bringing of an action when a change is made in a statute i)f limitations has sometimes given rise to discussion. In the present case there is no such embarrassment, for here no time whatever was allowed with respect to the case of these appellees and all others against whose lawful ownership an unlawful possession had been held for more than six years but less than twenty years at the time of the making of the Judicial Order.
Since the proceeding for converting the entry of possession into a dominio title, as well as the proceeding for the entry of possession itself, was taken without notice to the owners, the effect of, the Judicial Order was precisely the same as if the Military Governor had declared that the property in question should be taken from the lawful owner and given to the fraudulent occupant.
Certainly General Henry can have had no such purpose, and must have been wrongly advised with respect to
the results that would flow from making the order retroactive. Otherwise he would have confined it to cases where there still remained a reasonable opportunity for the real owner 'to contest thepretensions of the possessor. And in view of the instructions under which he derived his authority, the Judicial Order must be construed as if
expressly thus limited.
But appellants rely upon Articles 33, 34, 36, and 37, already quoted; the effect of. which is that the title of
ti person who according to the registry has a right theretb

[e. g. Morales] shall not. be invalidated with regard to third persons te, g.appellants] after they have once been recorded, although later the'right of the person execiuting them [Morales] is annulled Or deterninedfor reasons wtich do not clearly appear from the registry;" and also, that "suits for rescission or determination of title shall not be instituted against third persons [e. g. appellants] who have recorded the instruments of their respective interests in conformity with the provisions of this law," except, however, "suits for rescission or deterrnination of title which are due to the causes plainly expressed in the registry." It is said that since Morales secured the possessory title in 1890, and recorded it in the same year, and secured the conversion of that title into a title of ownership in the yeae 1899, and recorded this dorninio title in the same year, and in the year 1901 mortgaged the lands for value to the aIppllants, and followed this with a conveyance in 1903, he at all times appearing in the registry as sole owner, and since in their transactions with Morales, appellants acted in good faith and in the belief that he was the sole owner, they are
protected. .But the findings show that the entry of po'ssession in
favor of Morales 'declared that his right was "without prejudice to third parti6s who might show a better right to such possession," and that the proceedings for the conversion -of the entry of possession into a'record of ownership showed upon their face that they were based upon the provisions of the Judicial Order of April 4, 1899.
In other words, when appellants took from Morales the mortgage and deed under which they now claim, they were charged with notice upon the record that his entry of possession was subject to the rights of' others; and that by the law as it form'erly stood, those rights could not be cut off in less than twenty years.. They Were also. charged with notice that his dominio title depended upon

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.

230 U. S.

the validity of an order made by the Military Governor purporting to have a retroactive effect and to cut off, without notice or hearing, the claims of the identical third parties whose rights were preserved by the entry of possession; for at the time of the making of the Judicial Order, the six years had already run.
It is a familiar doctrine, universally recognized wvhere laws are in force for the registry or recording of instruinents of conveyance, that every purchaser takes his title subject to any defects and infirmities that maybe ascertained by reference to his chain of title as spread forth upon the public records. Brush v. Ware, 15 Pet. 93, 111; Simmons Creek Coal Co. v. Doran, 142 U. S. 417, 437; Northwestern Bank v. Freeman, 171 U. S. 620, 629; Mitchell v. D'Olier, 68 N. J. Law (39 Vr.), 375, 384; 53 Atl. Rep. 467; 59 L. R. A. 949.
This principle is recognized in Articles 34 and 37 of the Mortgage Law. In referring to "reasons which do not clearly appear from the registry," and "causes plainly expressed in the registry," they refer of course to matters of fact, not to matters of law.. In other words, if the registry gives notice of a state of facts that renders the title invalid or subject to question in law, the purchaser who relies upon the' record takes his title subject to whatever consequences may flow in law from the facts thus notified.
Appellants must be presumed, in accepting the mortgage and the conveyance from Morales, to have done so subject to whatever risk there may have been, arising from the want of authority on the part of General Henry to deprive third parties, without process of law, of those rights, that were saved by the terms of the entry of possession in favor of Morales.
Nor is there any real hardship in applying this rule; for the limitations under which the Military Governor exercised his temporaryj authority in Porto Rico must be deemed to have' been notorious everywhere, since they

NALLE v. OYSTER.
ERROR TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF
COLUMBIA.
No. 218. Submitted April 16, 1913.-Decided June 16, 1913.
The practice of bills of exceptions is statutory under the Statute of Westminster, 2, 13 Edw. I, c. 31, which prevailed in Maryland and was continued in force in the District of Columbia by the act of March 3, 1901, except as superseded by the Code established by that act.
Error appearing on 'the face of the record may be assigned as ground for reversal, although no exception be taken; nor is the function of an exception confined to the trial of the action but extends to all the pleas, challenges and evidence.
This practice was not modified by the Code, nor has it been by any rules of practice established under it; there is no provision giving the right to take exceptions on rulings other than those made in the course of the trial, except as based on the Statute of Westminster; nor does any rule of court require an exception to be taken in order to preserve rights of a plaintiff against whose declaration a demurrer has been sustained.
Section 1533 of the Code applies oniy where the demurrer has been overruled; it has no bearing upon a case where the demurrer has been sustained.
Ordinarily malice is to be implied from the mere publication of a libel, and justification or extenuation must proceed from the defendant; but where the communication is privileged, the burden is on the plaintiff to prove malice. White v. Nichols, 3 How. 266.
