RETIREMENT OF REPORTER AND APPOINTMENT OF SUCCESSOR.
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES.
MONDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 1946.
Present: The CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE BLACK, MR.
JUSTICE REED, MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, MR. JUSTICE RUTLEDGE, and MR. JUSTICE BuRToN.
The CHIEF JUSTICE said: Ernest Knaebel, who was appointed Reporter of this Court on October 10, 1916, served in that capacity until his retirement from active duty on January 31, 1944, a period of more than twenty-seven years, represented by eighty volumes of the United States Reports extending from Volume 242 to Volume 321, inclusive. The Court records its appreciation of his diligence and valued labors as Reporter during his term of office. We express sincere regret at the severance of a relationship which has been uniformly friendly and agreeable, and we wish for him in his retirement many years of well-earned repose.
The following is the text of Mr. Knaebel's letter re-
garding his retirement:
Washington,D. C., December13,1948. Honorable HARLAN F. STONE,
Chief Justice of the United States. DEAR MR. CHIEF JUSTICE:
Because of the wretched state of my health, which we have already considered, I deem it best that I retire
XI

REPORTER.
promptly from the office of Reporter. This I would do out of regard for the work that has been in my charge, as well as for my own security. I could wish to take the step on the 31st inst., unless you feel that, because of some matter wherein I might be of further use to the Court, postponement to a somewhat later day would be advisable.
During my long tenure-over twenty-seven yearscommencing with the October Term of 1916, I served under four Chief Justices and twenty-one Associate Justices. And, earlier, when in the course of my duties as Assistant Attorney General, I was called upon to address the Court quite frequently in cases affecting interests of the United States, I happily came to know still another Chief Justice and four of his Associates, who, like him, were gone from the Bench when my career as Reporter was conceived. So, as advocate or editor, I have labored in positions of usefulness and honor, under th eyes of five of the Chief Justices and twenty-five of the Associate Justices of this unique and very potent tribunal.
And now, as I look back over the long years and pen this valedictory, I declare myself to have been most fortunate, that I enjoyed so many opportunities for worthy and congenial occupation, and so many valued contacts with so many very able and very kindly superiors. For this I give thanks to you and your Associates; to the Justices who are living in retirement; and to the memories of that larger number who, alas, have passed from sight but whose good works will live on in the pages of my Reports.
With high regard, Very respectfully,
ERNEST KNAEBEL,
Reporter of Decisions.

REPORTER.

To which the Justices replied:
Washington,D. C., December 21, 1943.
ERNEST KNAEBEL, Esq., Reporter, Supreme Court, Washington, D. C.
DEAR MR. KNAEBEL:
Since the beginning of the October Term, 1916, you have served the Court as its Reporter. Now as you inform us that, after twenty-seven years of service, you feel compelled to lay down your labors, we contemplate your retirement with regret, and with a sense of personal loss that so agreeable an association must come to an end.
In accepting your resignation we wish you to know that we hold in grateful esteem the diligent, loyal and capable performance of your duties through these many years. In that you have perpetuated a long and honorable tradition of the Court, and you will stand as an example to those who will follow you in the years to come.
We unite in expressing to you sentiments of personal regard, and the wish for you and for Mrs. Knaebel of many years enjoyment of the durable satisfactions which come from leisure well earned and well spent.
Yours sincerely,
HARLAN F. STONE.

RESIGNATION OF MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS.
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES.
MONDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1945.
Present: The CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE BLACK, MR.
JUSTICE REED, MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, MR. JUSTICE
DOUGLAS, MR. JUSTICE MURPHY, and MR. JUSTICE RUTLEDGE.
The CHIEF JUSTICE said: With deep regret I announce the resignation of Mr. Justice Roberts as an Associate Justice of this Court. His resignation, tendered to the President last July, after the adjournment of the Court for the term, took effect on July 31 last. Appointed by President Hoover, Justice Roberts took his seat on the Bench on June 2, 1930. His term of office as a Justice of this Court thus extended over a period of fifteen years. During that period he has given to the Court and to the Nation the benefit of his great skill and wide knowledge, gained through years of assiduous study and practice of the law. He has faithfully discharged the heavy responsibility which rests on a Justice of this Court with promptness and dispatch, and with untiring energy. We who have shared with him that responsibility and in the common endeavor to make the law realize the ideal of justice among men, give to him the assurance of our continued good will and friendly regard. We wish for him in his retirement good health, abiding strength, and with them the full enjoyment of those satisfactions which will come from the continued devotion of his knowledge and skill to worthy achievement.
The text of Mr. Justice Roberts' letter of resignation to President Truman and the President's reply are published on the next page.

vm RESIGNATION OF MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES.
JUSTICE'S CHAMBERS.
Chester Springs, Pa., June 30, 1945.
THE PRESIDENT,
The White House,
SIR,
As I have served as a member of the Supreme Court for more than fifteen years and have attained the age of seventy years, I desire to avail myself of the provisions of Section 260 of the Judicial Code, as amended, (28 U. S. Code § 375) and to resign my office as Associate Justice. Accordingly I tender you my resignation to take effect July 31, 1945.
I am, sir, with great respect, Sincerely yours, OWEN J. ROBERTS.

THE WHITE HOUSE.

Washington,July 5, 1945.

DEAR MR. JUSTICE:

I am indeed sorry that you have decided to retire from

the Bench after your long service. The Supreme Court, in the period during which you

have served as a member, has been called upon to pass

upon some of the most important economic and social

problems in the history of our country.

As I told you this afternoon when I saw you and finally agreed to accept your resignation as of July 31,

1945, I do so only on your promise to continue to give

your country the benefit of your sound judgment and

advice as occasion arises.

I extend to you the gratitude of the nation for the

service you have rendered.

Very sincerely yours,

H uxY S. TRUMAN.

MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court
of the UnitedStates, Washington,D. C.
