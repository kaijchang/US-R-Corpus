APPEAL AND ERROR.
1. Effect of affirmance on both of two grounds upon which judgment below was rested.
A distinct ruling on any question fairly arising in a trial is not obiter dictum, and where the judgment rests upon two grounds, either being sufficient to sustain it, and the appellate court sustains it on both grounds, the ruling on neither is obiter but each is the ruling of the court and of equal validity with the other. Union Pacific Co. v. Mason City Co., 160.

2. Necessity for bill of exceptions or formal certificate on writ of error to review judgment of Circuit Court as to jurisdiction-Sufficiency of writ of error.
Where it is plainly apparent on the record that the only matters tried and decided in the Circuit Court were demurrers to pleas to the jurisdiction, and the petition upon which the writ of error was allowed asked only for the review of the judgment which decided that the court had- no
jurisdiction, no bill of exceptions or formal certificate in respect to the matter decided is required and the writ of error will not be dismissed because authenticated by a judge other than the trial judge, and not
made at the term in which the judgment wa:s entered. Petri v. Creelman Lunber Co., 487.

2. Power of special master to sue to collect assets of bankrupt. Where the decree appointing a special master gave him express authority

2; Contracts and due process oj law-Validity of Iowa law relative to combinations of insurance companies.
Section 1754 of the Iowa Code of 1897, prohibiting combinations of insurance companies as to rates, commissions, and manner of transacting business, is not unconstitutional as depriving the companies of their property or of their liberty of contract within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment and the auditor of the State will not be enjoined from enforcing the provisions of the statute. A company lawfully doing business in a State is no more bound by a general unconstitutional enactment than a citizen of that State. Carrollv. Greenwich Insurance Co., 401. See LOCAL L.Aw (FLORIDA); STATEs, 4; TAXATION, 2, 3, 9.

3. Due process of law; deprivation of liberty; interference by state authorities in proceedings in Federal courts.
Statutes should be given a reasonable construction with a view to make effectual the legislative intent; and the granting by the Governor of a State of a reprieve to a person sentenced to death in order that an appeal may be heard in this court, from an order of the District Court dismissing a petition in habeas corpus proceedings, is not such an interference by state authorities in a proceeding in the Federal courts in violation of § 766, Rev. Stat., as will make the subsequent confinement and execution of the prisoner a deprivation of liberty or life without due process of law. Rogers v. Peck, 425.
4. Due process of law as respects procedure in criminal cases in state courts. Due process of law, guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, does not
require the State to adopt a particular form of procedure, so long as the accused has had sufficient notice and adequate opportunity to defend himself in the prosecution, and the State may determine, free from

INDEX.

Federal interference or control, in what courts crime may be prosecuted and by what courts the prosecutions may be reviewed. Ib.

5. Due process and equal protection of laws-Validity of New York law
regulating sale of milk. Section 66 of the Sanitary Code of the City of New York, regulating the
sale of milk in that city, as the same has, been construed by the highest court of that State, held not violative of the Fourteenth Amendment as depriving those engaged in that business of their property without due process of law or denying them the equal protection of the laws. Lieberman v. Van De Carr, 552.

See CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, 17;
JURISDICTION, C 6;

STATES, 2, 8;
TAXATION, 2, 5, 6, 10i 11.

6. Equal protection of laws-:Effect of law of one county as to jury trial differing from that of other counties.
The fact that a law relating to jury trials applicable to a particular county in a State is different from the general law on that subject applicable to all other counties is not necessarily a discrimination against the peop]e of the county affected and a denial of the equal protection of the law, and so held, in this case, it appearing that every person within the county affected was accorded equal l3rotection of the law prevailing there. Gardner v. Michigan, 325.

7. Equal protection of laws-Validity of legislation confined to a familiar and well-defined class of perils.
The statute of Minnesota, G. S., 1894, § 2701, providing that the liability of railroad companies for damages to employfs shall not be diminished by reason of the accident* occurring through the negligence of fellow servants, and excepting from its provisions damages sustained by employfs engaged in construction of new and unopened railroads, does not, as interpreted by the highest 3ourt of that State, discriminate against any class of railroads or den to such class the equal protection of the laws; the exception merely narks the time when the statutetakes effect. There is no objection under the Fourteenth Amendment co legislation confined to a peculiar, and well-defined class of perils, and it is not necessary that they are shared by the public if they concern the body of citizens engaged in a particular work. Minnesota Iron Co. v. Kline, 593.

8. Implied inhibitionas to intererence of Federaland state government. That which is implied is as much a part of the Constitution as that which
is expressed, and amongst the implied matters is that the Nation may

1NDEX.
not prevent a State from discharging the ordinary functions of government, and no State can interfere with the National Government in the free exercise of the powers conferred upon it. South Carolina v. United States, 437.
9. Limitation,of powers delegated to Congress. The National Government is one of enumerated powers, and a power enu-
merated and delegated by the Constitution to Congress is comprehensive and complete, without other limitations than those found in the Constitution itself. lb.
10. New conditions embraced within scope of powers conferred. The Constitution is a written instrument, and, as such, its meaning does
not alter. Its language, as a grant of power to the National Government, is general and, as changes come in social and political life, it embraces all new conditions within the scope of the powers conferred. lb.
11. Power of National Government over license taxes, The framers of the Constitution in granting to the National Government
full power over license taxes intended that the power should be complete and not to be destroyed by the States extending their functions in a manner not then contemplated. lb.
12. Preservationof even balance between Nationaland state governments' To preserve the even balance between the National and state governments
and hold each in its separate sphere is the duty of all courts, and preeminently of this court. lb.
13. Recourse to common law and position of framers of Constitution in its. interpretation.
In interpreting the Constitution recourse must be had to the common law, and also to the position of the framers of the instrument, and what they must have understood to be the meaning and scope of the grants of power contained therein must be considered. lb.
14. Second jeopardy--Action of appellate court in finding appellants guilty of higher crime than that of which convicted below.
Plaintiffs in error were tried for murdei in the court of first instance in the Philippine Islands and were acquitted of the crime of murder and convicted of the crime of asault and were sentenced to six months' imprisonment and a fine. They appealed to the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands, which reversed that judgment and found them guilty of homicide and sentenced them to various terms from eight to fourteen years' imprisonment and a fine. On a writ of error seeking to review the judgment on the ground that the action of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands amounted to putting the accused in second jeopardy, held, that: There is a vital difference between an attempt of VOL. CX('IX--4()

INDEX.
the Government to review a verdict of acquittal in the court of first instance, and the action of the accused in himself appealing from a judgment which convicts him of one offense while acquitting him from the higher one charged in the indictment. Kepner v. United States, ,195 U. S. 100, distinguished. Where upon the indictment of a greater offense the one accused is found not guilty thereof but guilty of a lower offense included therein, and upon appeal from that judgment a new trial is granted by the appellate court, the accused can, on the new trial, be tried for the greater offense in the indictment, and such new trial does not amount to placing him in jeopardy a second time for the same offense within the meaning of the Federal Constitution or of the provisions in that regard in the Philippine Act of July 1, 1902, 32 Stat. 691. The appeal of the accused in such case amounts to a waiver to the plea of second jeopardy by asking that he be again tried for the offense for which he has once been convicted and if that request be granted he must take the burden with the benefit and go back for the new trial upon the whole case. Quore, whether the constitutional provision against second jeopardy was intended to apply to a judgment under these circumstances. Trono v. United States, 521.
15. States;' effect of first ten amendments on powers of States as to their own people.
The first ten amendments to the Federal Constitution operate on ,the National Government only and were not intended to, and did not, limit the powers of the States in respect to their own people. Jack v. Kansas, 372.
16. States; power to grant to witness immunity for violation of Federal statute. A State cannot by statute grant immunity to a witness from prosecution
by the United States for violation of a Federal statute, or prevent the testimony given by him under compulsion of the statute from being used against him in a prosecution by the United States, and the ab: sence of such immunity from prosecution by the United States, does not necessarily invalidate the statute under the Fourteenth Amendment. lb.
17. States; validity, under Federal Constitution, of Kansas anti-trust law in respect of immunity from prosecution of witness.
The provisions in the Kansas anti-trust law, as construed by the highest court of that State, compelling witnesses to testify as to violations of the act, and granting immunity from prosecution for violations testified to, or the use of the testimony against the witness, are not void under the Fourteenth Amendment, because immunity from Federal prosecution is not granted; and one committed, in accord with the provisions of the statute, for contempt for refusing to testify to acts within his knowledge is not deprived of his liberty without due process of law. lb.
18. Taking of property within meaning of constitntional provision as to cornpeuation.

INDEX.

Where there is a practical destruction, or material impairment of value, of lands by overflowing them as the result of construction of dams, there is a taking within the meaning of the Federal Constitution which demands compensation, but otherwise when the owner. is merely put, as in this case, to additional expense in warding off the consequences of the overflow. Manigault v. Springs, 473.
19. Taking private property, etc.-Sharing in common benefit as compensation. Property rights of individuals must be subordinated tq the general good
and if the owner of garbage suffers any -loss by its destruction he is compensated therefor in the common benefit secured by the regulation requiring all garbage to be destroyed. Gardner v. Michigan, 325.
20. Taking private property, etc.-Validity of ordinance for cremation of
garbage. An ordinance of the competent municipal authorities based upon reason-
able grounds for the cremation of garbage and refuse at a designated place as a means for the protection of the public health is not a taking of private property for public use without compensation within the meaning of the Federal Constitution even though such garbage and refuse may have some elements of value for certain purposes. Reduction Co. v. Sanitary Reduction Works, 306; Gardner v. Michigan, 325.

21. Taking private property, etc.; right to make claim based on. Where the basis of the claim that an ordinance is unconstitutional as taking
private property for public use without compensation the claim must be made by one whose property is taken, and it cannot be raised on his behalf by others whose property is not taken. Reduction Co. v. Sanitary Reduction Works, 306.
22. Taking private property, etc.-Validity of exclusive privilege to dispose. of garbage.
The exclusive privilege granted to one company by the Board of Supervisors of San Francisco to dispose of the garbage in the city and county of-San Francisco held not to be void as taking the property of householders for public use without compensation. lb.

CONTRACTS.
1. Construction as to place of delivery of good,,. In construing a contract with the Commissary General for supplies to posts
in Cuba described at one place as "remote from the seacoast" and at

INDEX.

another as "in the interior of the island;" held, that the two phrases meant the same thing and interpreted the word "interior," and that the contemporaneous construction of the Commissary General in refusing to take supplies for a post about eight miles from Havana and the camping ground for that city, that the contract applied only to posts remote from the seacoast, was correct. Also held that the written contract could not be extended to places not specified therein, by an indefinite oral agreement. Simpson v. United States, 397.

2. Mail; right of contractor to extra compensation. In construing a contract for mail service in New York City, held that:
The new and additional mail messenger or transfer service which the contractor could be required to perform under authority of the Postmaster General without additional compensation did not include a vast amount of additional work necessitated by the opening of a new
post office not contemplated by either of the parties when the contract was made. The same principles of right and justice which prevail between individuals should control the construction and carrying out of contracts between the Government and individuals. The contractor had a right to presume the Government knew how many stations were to be served; and, where the proposals positively specified that only two elevated railroad stations were to be served, the contractor was entitled to extra compensation for serving four stations notwithstanding the proposal required the bidders to inform themselves as to facts and stated that additional compensation would not be allowed for mistakes. The contractor was not entitled to extra compensation for "foot service," carrying mails up and down steps at elevated-railroad stations, as delivery at the foot of the steps would have been insufficient. United States v. Stage Company, 414.

Inspection of books by shareholders a matter of right. The shareholder has a common law right, for proper purposes and under
reasonable regulations as to time and place, to inspect the books of the corporation of which he is a member. The possibility of the abuse of a legal right affords no ground for its denial, and while an examination of the books of a corporation should not be granted for speculative or improper purposes, it should not be denied when asked for legitimate purposes.

COURTS.
1. Conclusiveness of decision of Land Department on questions of fact. The decision of the proper officers of the Land Department on questions of
fact in a contest is conclusive on the courts and, in the absence of fraud in preventing a party from presenting his case, the decision is not subjected'to -review by the courts by a charge of perjury against the witnesses. Estes v. Timmons, 391.
2. Correctionof ambiguous language of decree. Where the language of the decree of the Circuit Court is open to miscon-
struction it should be corrected by the Circuit Court itself. Union Pacific Co. v. Mason City Co., 160.
3. Discretion of Circuit Court to issue writ of certiorari auxiliary to writ of habeas corpus.
While the Circuit Court has power to issue a writ of certiorari auxiliary to the writ of habeas corpus it is wholly discretionary with it, and its refusal to do so cannot be assigned as error. Hyde v. Shine, 62.
4. Disqualificationof judge for interest as ground for reversal. While courts will guard against any attempt of an interested judge to force
himself upon litigants, if the record does not clearly establish the disqualification relied upon this court will not disturb the judgment on that ground. MeGuire v. Blount, 142.
5. Judicialnotice. Courts may take judicial notice of the effect of garbage on the public health.
Gardnerv. Michigan,325.
6. Power to direct verdict. Where the court would be bound to set a verdict aside for want of testimony
to support it, it may direct a finding in the first instance and not await the enforcement of its view by granting a new trial. MeGuire v. Blount, 142.
7. Procedure in courts of Philippine Islands in. criminal cases-Power of appellate court to convict of higher offense than that of judgment appealed from.
Plaintiffs in error were tried for murder in the court of first instance in the Philippine Islands and were acquitted of the crime of murder and convicted of the crime of assault and were sentenced to six months' imprisonment and a fine. They appealed to the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands, which reversed that judgment and found them guilty of homicide and sentenced them to various terms from eight to fourteen years' imprisonment and a fine. On a writ of error seeking to review

INDEX.

the judgment on the ground that the action of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands amounted to putting the accused in second jeopardy, held that: In reversing the lower court and itself convicting the accused on such appeal, the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands acted within its powers, and in ordinary procedure in the courts of that country under the act of July 1, 1902.

CRIMINAL LAW. 1. Conspiracy; place of trial where conspiracy entered into although completed
elsewhere. Where the indictment charges that a conspiracy was entered into in a Dis-
trict, the, trial court of that District has jurisdiction of the offense although the overt acts carrying out the conspiracy were committed in another jurisdiction. While this court does not approve the practice of indicting citizens in courts far distant from their residence if they can be tried in courts of their own jurisdiction, §1014, Rev. Stat. contains no discrimination based upon distance and requires the commitment to be made for trial before the court having cognizance of the offense, and in the absence of an exception in the statute the court cannot create one. Hyde v. Shine, 62.
2. Conspiracy;sufficiency ol indictment. On the facts in this case the indictment which charges a completed con-
spiracy to defraud the United States by means of obtaining state lands through sales to fictitious persons and then exchanging them' for lands of the United States under the forest reserve acts, held sufficient notwithstanding that the State received full compensation for the land. lb.
3. Review, upon habeas corpus, of validity of indictment.Whether the act charged is or is not a crime is one which the trial court is
competent to decide, and, under the circumstances of this case, this court will not review the validity of the indictment upon habeas corpus. lb.
4. Jurisdictionof criminal court of District of Columbia. Section 23, ch 35, Comp. Stat. District of Columbia, giving the Criminal
Court of the District jurisdiction of all crimes and misdemeanors committed in the District, not lawfully triable in any other court, has reference only to other courts within the District, and was not intended to change the law with respect to the general jurisdiction of courts having jurisdiction of the same offense. lb.

if there is an entire lack of evidence to support the accusation, where a prima faoie case is made by the indictment, and the commissioner receives evidence on petitioner's behalf, it is for him to determine whether probable cause existed and the court will not weigh the evidence on
habeas corpus. lb.

1. Sufficiency of identification of land. In an action of ejectment in which the plaintiff relied upon a line of con-
veyances not going back to the original source of title coupled with possession on the part of a grantor, held, on a discussion of the evidence that the deeds sufficiently identified the land and that the plaintiff was .entitled to go to the jury on the question of possession. Chesapeake Beach Ry. v. Washington R. R., 247.
2. Title passed by trustee's deed under decree of foreclosure. A deed by the trustee of a mortgage reciting a foreclosure decree is not
limited in its operation to the authority conferred by the decree but passes the title of the trustee to the land which it purports to convey. lb.

EJECTMENT.
1. Sufficiency of title to enable plaintiff to recover. The plaintiff in ejectment must recover on the strength of his own title,
which must be sufficiently established to warrant a verdict in his favor, and in the absence of that open, notorious and continuous adverse possession necessary to prove a title by prescription, he may be defeated if the defendant is not a mere trespasser or interloper and shows an outstanding and subsisting title in a stranger. McGuire v. Blotnt, 142.
2. Pleading; effect of reference to tax sales of land demanded, to import outstanding title.
A reference in a declaration to tax sales of the land demanded will not be construed to import that there is a title outstanding in third persons, as against the allegation that the plaintiff was lawfully seized of the premises, no evidence having been taken on the subject at the-trial.

INSURANCE. 1. Forfeiture of policy for non-payment of premium. Promptness of payment of life insurance premiums is essential and although
forfeitures are not generally regarded with favor they are necessary and should be fairly enforced in regard to such payments. A statute requiring notice of time of payment of premium and effect of non-payment thereof should not be construed so as to make it a trap for either the company or the assured. Nederland Life Ins. Co. v. Meinert, 171.
2. Sufficiency of notice of non-payment of premium-Mistake cured by subsequent notice.
Where the assured has received the statutory notice, containing in the words of the statute a statement as to the effect of non-payment of the premium, the fact that a mistaken additional statement as to the forfeiture of the policy, by reason of such non-payment, was contained in the notice is not such a failure to comply with the terms of the statute as will prevent a forfeiture of the policy where it appears that after default the assured received another notice in regard thereto, had an opportunity to reinstate the policy by payment of the premium, within a specified time according to the poliqy, but made no payment for over three years, and did not ask for any extension of time, and the company had noted the forfeiture on its books. lb. See CONSTITUTIONAL LAw, 2; MORTGAGE AND DEED OF TRUST, 2.
INTERNAL REVENUE. 1. Intoxicating liquors; effect of sale by State on operation of taxing power
of Federal Government. A State may control the sale of liquor by the dispensary system adopted in
South Carolina, but when it does so it engages in ordinary private business which is not, by the mere fact that it is being conducted by a State, exempted from the operation of the taxing power of the National Government. South Carolina v. United States, 437.
2. Liability of agents of State for internalrevenue tax on sale of liquors. Persons who sell liquor are not relieved from liability for the internal revenue
tax imposed by the Federal Government by the fact that they have no interest in the profits of the business and are simply the agents of a State which, in the exercise of its sovereign power, has taken charge of the business of selling intoxicating liquor. They are persons within the meaning of sections 3140, 3232 and 3244, Rev, Stat. lb.
3. Exemption of state agencies from National taxation. The exemption of state agencies and instrumentalities from National taxa-

4. Nature of tax on liquor. The internal revenue tax on the sale of liquor is not a tax on property or

1. Sufficiency of involution of Federalquestion in state court. A petition for rehearing to the Supreme Court of the State is too late to
raise Federal questions in that court unless the petition is entertained and the point passed on. CorkranOil & Development Co. v. Arnaudet, 182; French'v. Taylor, 274. la. Although title may be claimed in the state court under a Federal statute, if the decision of that court rests on a ground independent of that statute, and involving no Federal question the writ of error will be dismissed. CorkranOil & Development Co. v. Arnaudet, 182.
2. Where the vadility of a state revenue statute itself is not drawn in ques-
tion, but plaintiff in error contends that he was denied due process of law because state officers acting thereunder did not fully comply with the statute, only questions of local law and fact are involved and the determination of the state court is not reviewable on writ of error by this court. French v. Taylor, 274.

3. Existence of Federal question where decision of state court rested on construction of state laws.
It is the power and duty of this court to determine for itself the existence or non-existence of the contract, the obligation whereof is claimed to have been impaired, and a Federal question may be involved, although the state court may have rested its decision on the construction of the constitution and laws of the State. Kies v. Lowrey, 233.
4. Sufficiency of certificate of presiding judge of state court as to Federal question involved in decision, to give this court jurisdiction,where record does not otherwise show it to exist.
A certificate of the presiding judge of the state court made after the decision to the effect that a Federal question was considered and decided, cannot confer jurisdiction on this court where the record does not otherwise show it to exist. When the court makes such a certificate and orders it to be attached to and form part of the record itself, it may be sufficient to show that Federal questions were before the state court decided by it so that this court may pass upon those questions which are specified, but the statement that the plaintiff in error made a general contention that the statute involved and proceedings thereunder were an invasion of his private rights in violation of the Constitution is too vague to raise any Federal question. Marvin v. Trout, 212.
5. On decision by state court as to bar of limitations against suit by receiver of national bank to collect assessment on stock.
Where the state court has held that a suit to collect assessment by the receiver of a national bank under directions of the Comptroller of the Currency is barred by a state statute of limitations, a Federal question is involved and the writ of error will not be dismissed. Rancin v, .arton, 228.

C. OF CIRCUIT COURTS.

1. Citizenship of plaintiffs; necessity for all being citizens of same State. Where suit is brought in the district of defendant's residence by plaintiffs
who are citizens of other States than that of defendant, the Circuit Court has jurisdiction although plaintiffs are not themselves citizens of the

same State. Sweeney v. Carter Oil Co., 252.

2. Sufficiency of averment of ground o/ jurisdiction. Where the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court is invoked not only on the
ground of diverse citizenship but also on a constitutional question, the
mere averment of the latter is not sufficient if it is so wanting in merit as to be frivolous and, under such circumstances, if an appeal and. a petition for certiorari are both pending, as in this case, the appeal will be dismissed; but if the correctness of the decree on the general issue should be considered the writ will be allowed and the record on appeal
treated as a return thereto. Farrell v. O'Brien, 89.

3. Of matters of probate of wills. As the authority to make wills is derived from the State and the require-
ment of probate is but a regulation to make a will effective, matters of pure probate, in the strict sense of the words, are not within the jurisdiction of courts of the United States. lb.
4 Where a state law, statutory or customary, gives to the citizens of the
State, in an action or suit inter partes, the right to question at law the probate of a will or to assail probate in a suit in equity the courts of the United States in administering the rights of citizens of other States or aliens will enforce such remedies. The action or suit inter partes, however, must relate to independent controversies and not to mere controversies which may arise on an application to probate or a mere method of procedure ancillary to the original procedure. Ib
5. The statutory procedure of the State of Washington, for probate of wills
relates to nuncupative wills as well as ordinary wills, and the authority conferred on the courts to contost a will is a part of the probate procedure, and does not cause a contest to be a suit inter partes, and therefore the Circdit Court of the United States, in a case where jurisdiction is based on diverse citizenship, is without jurisdiction to declare either the non-existence of a nuncupative will or the nullity of the probate thereof by the probate court. lb.

6. Where the state statute provides that within a fixed period after its ad-
mission to probate interested parties may question the validity of a

INDEX.

639

will or its probate, and the statute applies to written and nuncupative wills, the preliminary admission of a nuncupative will to probate and
the temporary control taken of the property, both real and personal, by the probate court without the notice required by statute, do not so deprive the parties of their property without due process of law within the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment as to afford a constitutional basis for the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of the United States in a suit where diverse citizenship exists to enjoin the enforcement of the decree of probate, and the decree of the Circuit
Court of Appeals is final. lb.

E. OF FEDERAL COURTS GENERALLY.
Interference with State in administrationof its law for prosecution of crime. It is only where fundamental rights, specially secured by the Federal Con-
stitution, are invaded that the Federal courts will interfere with a State in the administration of its law for the prosecution of crime, and it will not be presumed that if the freedom of a person properly convicted of murder and sentenced to death is improperly restricted that the state authorities will not afford the necessary relief. Federal courts will not, by writs of habeas corpus, reverse the proceedings of state courts while acting within their jurisdiction under statutes which do not .conflict with the Federal Constitution, and the decision of the state court that it is not necessary for the court to refix the day for execution of a person already sentenced by the court and reprieved by the Governor, where the reprieve definitely sets the day, is one wholly within state practice and is not controlled by Federal Constitution or laws.

Florida. Power of legislature to prevent unjust discrimination and excessive charges by public service corporations. The constitution of Florida has a clause to the effect that the legislature is invested with full powers to prevent unjust discrimination and excessive charges by persons and corporations engaged as common carriers and performing other public services of a public nature, and that it shall provide for enforcing such laws. In pursuance of this clause a law was passed empowering cities to prescribe by ordinance maximum reasonable charges for water, provided that the act should not impair the validity of any valid contract, or be held to validate any contract theretofore made. After the constitution, but before the act, the city of Tampa had made a contract with a water. company, giving the water company the right to charge certain rates. After the act it passed an ordinance fixing lower rates not, however, alleged to be unreasonable. The Supreme Court of Florida sustained the ordinance, reading the statute as giving the power

INDEX.
to fix reasonable rates, when it was possible, without impairing the obligation of contracts, and the constitution as meaning that the legislature was to have an inalienable power to make such laws.

their refusing to do so and procuring the sale. An open cessation of performance with the intent to do no more, even if justified, excuses the other party from further performance on his side. The same principles which apply to the making of a contract apply to the breach of it, and to non-performance of the conditions attached to the other side.

MORTGAGE AND DEED OF TRUST. 1. Inclusion in mortgage of growing crops and effect of harvest and manu-
facture of product therefrom on lien of mortgage. The owner of an estate in Porto Rico mortgaged the property to a bank,
the mortgage being granted by notarial act describing the property and the fruits thereof and declaring that it was all planted in cane except certain specified parts including the sugar manufactory and that the loan secured was to enable the borrower to develop and keep the plantation; as additional collateral the owner delivered to the bank a policy of fire insurance on "stock of sugar and molasses deposited in the sugar manufactory on the estate" which was not to take effect, however, until several months thereafter; after the policy took effect and during its life the sugar house and stock was burned; action was not brought until more than fifteen but less than twenty years thereafter. Meanwhile the bank had become bankrupt and a special master appointed with power to collect the assets thereof. In an action by the special master on the policy the company denied liability and the plaintiff's capacity to sue, also pleading prescription. The lower court permitted one of the parties claiming an after-acquired interest in the policy antc.gonistic to the plaintiff to be joined as party plaintiff. A verdict was rendered for both against the company. In sustaining the verdict, Held, that: under the law in force in Porto Rico the growing crop was, by operation of law, included in the mortgage to the bank even though it had not expressly purported to embrace the fruits growing upon the mortgaged premises. The growing crop continued to be affected by the mortgage after its harvest or manufacture into sugar up to the time of itsremoval or warehousing. Royal Insurance Co.v. Miller, 353.

Power to make and enforce reasonable sanitary and other regulationas, and to fix period of privilege to be exercised for public benefit.
The Board of Supervisors of the city and county of San Francisco have full authority under the constitution and laws of the State of California to make and enforce within that city and county all such reasonable sanitary and other regulations as are not in conflict with any general statute or with the constitution, and which have for their object the preservation of the public health by whatever cause endangered. Where the power of the authorities to gr.nt privileges to be exercised for public benefit is not limited by law in that respect the duration of the period for which the privilege is granted is a matter in their discretion to be determined on grounds of public policy, and, even if such privileges"ought not be granted for long periods, the courts cannot declare a grant void merely on that ground. Where a regulation enacted by competent -public authority for the protection of the public health has a real, substantial relation to that object the courts will not strike it down on groundA of public policy or expediency.

See CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, 20, 22; STATES, 2.
NATIONAL BANKS.
1. Conclusiveness of determination by Comptroller of the Currency relative to collection of, assessment on stock.
A national bank is an instrumentality of the United States, the administration whereof is vested in the Comptroller of the Currency, who, in case of insolvency, appoints the receiver and directs his acts. The liability for assessment on the stock dates from the order of the Comptroller who decides when it is necessary to institute proceedings therefor, and his determination is conclusive. This power is derived from a statute of the United States and cannot be controlled or limited by state statutes. Rankin v. Barton, 228.
2. Citizenship-Jurisdictionof Federal courts-Powerof States. States have po power to enact legislation contravening Federal laws for the
control of national banks, but such banks are, for actions against them at law or in equity, deemed citizens of the States in which they are located, and the Federal courts have such jurisdiction only as they have in cases between individual citizens of the same States. Guthrie v. Harkness, 148.

INDEX.
3. Right of shareholders to inspect books. The shareholder has a common law right, for proper purposes and under
reasonable iegulations as to time and place, to inspect the books of the corporation of which he is a member. The possibility of the abuse of a legal right affords no ground for its denial, and while an examination of the books of a corporation should not be granted for speculative or improper purposes, it should not be denied when asked for legitimate purposes. Where stockholders of a national bank have the legal right to enforce inspection, the state court has authority to enforce the right by granting the proper relief in a judicial proceeding. Nothing in see. 5211, Rev. Stat., requiring reports by, or in see. 5240, Rev. Stat., providing for examination of, national banks cuts down the usual common law rights of shareholders in such corporations. The term visitorial powers as used in sec. 5241 does not include the common law right of the shareholder to inspect the books of the corporation. Ib.

2. Suspension of bill to try disputed title. If upon a bill of partition a defendant claims a paramount title and posses-
sion on grounds which give color to his claim and against which the plaintiffs at least are not entitled to equitable relief, the proper course

INDEX.
is to suspend the bill and give the plaintiffs an opportunity to sue at law. lb.
3. Effect of dismissal of bill as against de/endant claiming paramount title. If a bill for partition is dismissed for laches and want of jurisdiction .s
against a defendant claiming a paramount title, and afterwards the court proceeds to decree a partition and sale, the dismissal is not a ba;r to a subsequent petition of the defendant to come in and oppose tie creation of a cloud upon his title. lb.
4. Finalityof decreeconfirming report of commissionersas to partitionand sale. A decree confirming and adopting a report of commissioners recommend-
ing a conveyance of part of the land to certain of the parties and a sale of the residue Bnd distribution of the proceeds as thereafter ordered when the sale was confirmed by the court, is not a final decree. lb.
PATENT FOR INVENTION. Right of inventor to royalties. A bicycle manufacturing company made a contract with an inventor to use,
obtain patents for, and exploit the sale of, improved coaster brakes, for which applications for patents were then pending, the company to be relieved from payment of royalties in case of adverse action of the patent office. Subsequently the company having acquired and used other inventions and the inventor brought suit alleging neglect to use diligence in obtaining the patents for, or pushing the sales of, his brakes and demanding royalties on all coaster brakes used and sold by the company. Held that: Although the company might not be able to obtain the patents as expected it could not rescind the contract without returning what it had received under it and it must pay royalties on any devices used by it embodying the invention unless and until final adverse action by the patent office. That, as the contract was not made on the footing that no such brakes had ever been invented, the inventor could not claim the entire field and was not entitled -to royalties on other brakes used by the company radically different from his both in-construction and operation and which could not have been an infringement of any patent contemplated by the contract.

Although a writ of prohibition will lie to an inferior court acting manifestly beyond its jurisdiction, the writ will issue only where there is no other remedy; and even though the judgment may be void, as that fact does not prevent its reversal on appeal, mandamus cannot be resorted to where the statute gives an appeal. The requirement of giving a bond on appeal is an ordinary incident of litigation and does not obviate the necessity of the appeal and justify the issuing of a writ of mandamus. Alexander v. Crollott, 580.

PUBLIC LANDS.
1. Controlling effect of official surveys-Rights of patentees under conflicting patents.
Two official surveys of a tract of land bordering on navigable waters were, with an interval of thirty years, duly made, approved and filed in the Land Department at Washington. By the earlier survey a fractional section was dividd into two lots, by the later into seven. These divisions conflicted. After the later survey two patents were issued, one using the description in the first and conveying the entire fractional section, and the other following the second survey and conveying only part of the secti-n. As to a portion of the ground these patents conflicted. In an action at law in the state court the second patent prevailed as to the tract in conflict. Hcld thdt, in the absence of findings of fact (there being evidence tending to show that the first patentee took with full knowledge of the two surveys, the later, one having been made partly at least at his request, and it also appearing that by the decision he received the full number of acres to which he was by the earlier survey entitled and for which he paid), the judgment in favor of the second patentee for the part in conflict ought not to b6 disturbed. Gleason v. White, 54.
2. Effect lof patent to fictitious person on rights of 'subsequent bona fide purchaser.
A p/tent to a fictitious person is in legal effect no more than a declaration

that the Government thereby conveys the property to no one, and in such a case the doctrine that a subsequent bona fide purchaser is protected does not apply. Hyde v. Shine, 62.
3. Rights acquired by mere settlement upon and making improvements on public lands.
Appellant without authority settled on a tract of land on Afognak Island, Alaska, prior to 1901, and erected a cannery. After the act of March 3, 1891, 26 Stat. 1100, it applied for a survey of the land occupied by it and deposited the money therefor. The survey was made, approved and forwarded to the Commissioner of the General Land Office. On December 24, 1892, the President, under provisions of the said act of March 3, 1891, by proclamation, declared the whole island reserved for fish culture. The survey was rejected on that and other grounds and appellant was ordered to leave the island, which it did. Thereupon it sued in the Court of Claims for value of its improvements and for loss of business. The claim was disallowed except for cost of survey. In affirming the judgment held, that the mere settlement upon public lands and making improvements thereon without taking some steps required by law to initiate the settler', right thereto, is wholly inoperative as against the United States. This rule is not affected as to lands in Alaska by any provisions of the act of May 17, 1884, 23 Stat. 24, providing a civil governmant for Alaska. Although the occupation and cultivation of public lands with a view to preemption confer a' preference over others in the purchase of such lands by the bona fide settler which will enable him to protect his possession against other individuals, it does not confer any vested rights as against the United States. Russian-American Packing Co. v. United States, 570.
4. Rights acquired by purchaser under prelmption laws by mere deposit /or survey and before payment of purchase price.
Un d er the pret~mption laws a purchaser availing of the provisions of the act of March 3, 1891, to purchase land in Alaska acquires no vested rights by the mere deposit for the survey or until the purchase price is paid to, and receipt given therefor by, the proper land officer, and until this is done Congress may withdraw the land from entry and sale although inchoate rights of settlers may be defeated. Ib.
5. Effect of reservation of land for fish culture on rights of mere trespasser making improvements prior thereto.
The provisions of 14 of the act of March 3, 1891, authorized the reservation of the land for fish culture, and the exercise of this reserved power terminated all the rights of one who as a mere trespasser had settled thereon and made improvements prior to the passage of the nct. lb.
6. Rightto complete entry on death of entryman. Under §§ 2291, 2292, Rev. Stat., the widow of the entryman is first en
titled to complete the entry and obtain a patent, and a state law is not competent to change this provision and give the children of the entryman an interest prramount to that of the widow. McCune v. Essig, 382.

INDEX.
7. Indemnity lands; rights of Northern Pacific Railroad; disposition of, prior to approval of selections made by railroad;withdrawal from sale of such lands.
No rights to lands within indemnity limits will attach in favor of the railroad company until after selections made by it with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior. Up to the time such approval is given, lands within indemnity limits, although embraced by the company's list of selections, are subject to be disposed of by the United States or to be settled upon and occupied under the prebmption and homestead laws of the United States., The Secretary of the Interior has no authority to withdraw from sale or settlement lands within the indemnity limits which have not been previously selected, with his approval, to supply deficiencies within the place limits of the company's road. Sjoli v. Dreschel, 564.
8. Segregation of lands from public domain. The Northern Pacific Railroad Company could not acquire a vested in-
terest in particular lands, within or without place limits, merely by filing a map of general route and having the same approved by the Secretary of the Interior, although upon the definite location of its line of road and the filing and acceptance of a map thereof in the office of the Commissioner of the General Land Office, the lands within primary or place limits, not theretofore reserved, sold, granted or otherwise disposed of and free from prebmption or other claims or rights, become segregated from the public domain, and no rights in such place lands will attach in favor of any settler or occupant, after definite location. lb.
9. Title acquired under patent to homesteader-Estoppelof grantor to repudiate contract under which conveyance is made.
A homesteader, after obtaining his patent, conveyed to a lumber company all the standing timber on the land and other rights therein pursuant to a contract made prior to the issuing of the patent; subsequently he conveyed all his interest in the land to one who thereupon claimed the timber on the ground that the prior conveyance was void as violative of the land laws and land policy of the United States. Held, that when the patent issues to a homesteader the full legal title passes to the patentee and he may do with the land that which he sees fit. An executed contract, voluntarily executed, without fraud or duress, is binding and cannot be repudiated by the party who executed it, and one whose interest in land is acquired subsequently to a conveyance thereof by the owner has no higher right to question the conveyance than the grantor had. Although the grantee of the timber might not have been able to enforce the contract because void as made in violation of the land laws of the United States, the conveyance having becn voluntarily made after the issuing of the patent, could not be attacked on that ground by the grantor or his subsequent grantee. Whether the Government itself could challenge the conveyance not decided. Hartman v. Botterlield l bniher Co., 335.

INDEX.
10. Validity of agreement by preemptor under § 2262, Rev. Stat. A preemptor made an agreement with a party advancing money to pay
one-fourth of the expenses of making final proof to repay such party a certain portion of the proceeds of sale provided that after obtaining title he could find a purchaser and sell the land at its proper value. Held, that there was no mortgage, deed of trust, or agreement for specific lien, but that the agreement was only a promise to pay in case of sale and could not be enforced against the land, and that it therefori was not void under § 2262, Rev. Stat. Halemann v. Gross, 342.

RAILROADS. 1. Right of use in common of bridge over navigable river under Federalgrant
of permission to construct. In construing an act of Congress granting permission to construct a bridge
across a navigable river, the general policy of the Government to provide for the use of such a bridge, up to its reasonable capacity, by all connecting railroads on reasonable compensation to the owning company will be considered and accordingly so held in regard to the use by the Mason City Co. of the bridge across the Missouri River at Omaha, constructed under the act of 1871, 16 Stat. 430, and owned by the Union Pacific Railway. Union Pacific Co. v. Mason City Co., 160.
2. Rights acquired by purchaser at judicial foreclosure sale of railroad chartered by Congress.
In a great public enterprise such as the building of the Union Pacific Railroad under a Congressional charter reserving the right to alter, amend or repeal, public interests, and not simply private purposes are to be regarded, and the purchaser at judicial foreclosure sale takes the property subject to the proper regulations and use established by Congress, notwithstanding the mortgage foreclosed may have antedated the legislation. Ib.
3. Property rights ol-Power to make reasonable rules and regulations for use of property-Validity of grant of special privilege to certain hackmen to exclusion of others.
Although its functions are public, a railroad company holds the legal title to the property employed in the discharge of its duties, and while it must under all circumstances do everything reasonably necessary for the accommodation of passengers and shippers, it may use its property to the best advantage of the public and itself, and for that end may make reasonable rules and regulations for the use of its property consistent with the purposes for which it is created and not inconsistent with legally established regulations. When not unnecessary, unreasonable or arbitrary a railroad may make arrangements with, in-

cluding the granting of special privileges to, a single concern to supply passengers arriving at its terminals with hacks and cabs, and it is not bound, at least, in the absence of valid state legislation requiring it to do so, to accord similar privileges to other persons, even though they be licensed hackmen. Such an exclusive arrangement is not a monopoly in the odious sense of the word, nor does it involve an improper use by a railroad company of its property. Donovan v. Pennsylvania Company, 279.

REMOVAL OF CAUSES.
1. Diversity of citizenship on which right of removal can be exercised-Right of removal where one ot defendants is citizen of same, State as plaintiff.
A citizen of Alabama brought suit in an Alabama state court against a citizen of Maryland and a citizen ofAlabama, where upon the Circuit Court for the Northern District of Alabama ordered the removal of the case on the petition of the citizen of Maryland alleging prejudice or local influence. A motion to remand was denied, and the case went to trial and judgment. That judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court. of Appeals and a writ of error from this court was thereupon prosecuted. Held, that as the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court as exercised was dependent entirely on diversity of citizenship, the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals was final and the writ of error could not be maintained. But this court having granted the writ of certiorari in order to pass upon the question of the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, held,
(a)That the clause of the applicable statute treating of removals because of prejudice or local influence does not furnish a separate and independent ground of Federal jurisdiction and describes only a special case comprised in the preceding clauses.
(b) That those suits only can be removed of which the Circuit Courts are given original jurisdiction, and that the right of removal because of diversity of citizenship can only be exercised by a defendant who is a citizen, or by defendants who are citizens, of a State other than that in which the suit is pending.
(c)That as in the present case suit was brought in plaintiff's State against a citizen of the same State and a citizen of another State, it could not have been originally brought in the Circuit Court and the removal was improvidently granted.

INDEX.
(d) As the removal was had on the application of the non-resident defendant, the costs of this court and of the Circuit Court must be paid by that party. Cochran v. Montgomery County, 260.
2. Case involclJg construction of Federal statutes. The interest which arises in an entryman by his entry, who can fulfil the
conditions of settlement and proof in case of his death, and to whom the title passes depend upon the laws of the United States; and a suit brought by an heir, claiming under the law of a State, against the grantee of the widow who perfected title and obtained the patent involves the construction of sections 2291 and 2292, Rev. Stat., and other statutes relating to homesteads, and can be removed on that ground from the state court to the Circuit Court of the United States. McCune v. Essig, 382.
3. Removal for trial from judicial district in State to District of Columbia. Section 1014, Rev. Stat., authorizes a removal from a judicial district in
a State to the District of Columbia (Benson v. Ienkel, 198 U. S. 1). Hyde v. Shine, 62.
4. Procedure for removal for trial. The requirement in § 1014, Rev. Stat., that proceedings for removal shall
be agreeable to the usual state procedure, applies to the proceedings for arrest and examination of the accused before the commissioner, but not to subsequent independent proceedings before the Circuit Court on habeas corpns. lb.

STATES. 1. Absence of pecuniary damages affecting power of State to punish violations
of statute enacted as part of public policy. The States and the United States have power to punish violations of a stat-
ute enacted as a part of the public policy even though they may not have suffered any pecuniary damage from such violations. Hyde v. Shine, 62.
2. Contract arising in favor of school district created by legislature in respect of property thereof-Legislative power over subordinate municipalities.
Where the legislature of the State has the power to create and alter school districts and divide and apportion the property thereof, no contract arises in favor of any district created by an act, the obligation whereof is later impaired by a subsequent act altering the districts and transferring property, nor does such later act amount to the taking of the property of the district taken without due process of law. There are many ways in which the legislature has absolute power to make and change subordinate municipalities (Laramie County v. Albany County, 92 U. S. 307). Kies v. Lowr, v, 233.
3. Police power to authorizedams across interiorstreams previously navigable, for promotion of health.
In the absence of legislation by Congress, a State has full power to improve its lands and promote the general health by authorizing dams' across interior streams, although previously navigable to the sea. Nothing in the existing constitution of South Carolina interferes with the common law powers of the State over its navigable waters. Manigault v. Springs, 473.
4. Police powers; right of exercise where existing contracts mnay be affected. The interdiction of statutes impairing the obligation of contracts does not
prevent a State from properly exercising its police powers for the public good notwithstanding contracts previously entered into between individuals may be affected. Ib.
5. Police power; discretion as to exercise. While the police power of a State is subject to limitations there is a wide
discretion as to its exercise in the legislature, with whose determination as to what is and what is not necessary the courts ordinarily will not interfere. ib.
6. Police power; subserviency of prirate interests to exercise of. Except where property is taken for which compensation mst be made,

654

INDEX.

private interests are subservient to the exercise of the police power and must give way to general schemes for the public health. lb.

7. Public power; reclamation of swamp lands deleterious to public health. Courts may take judicial notice that the public health is greatly affected
by the existence of swamp lands and he reclamation of such lands is a proper exercise of the police powers. lb.
8. Police power in suppression of gambling; constitutionalityof law making judgment a lien against property in which gambling is conducted.
The suppression of gambling is within the police power of the State, and it may make a judgment against those winning the money a lien upon property owned by another and in which the gambling is conducted with the knowledge and consent of the owner, inW such a statute does not deprive the owner of his property without due process of law. Such a statute does not deprive the owner of the property upon which the judgment is made a lien of his property without due process of law because it does not provide for trial by jury in the action to enforce the lien. The State can give the whole or any part of the amount recoverable under such a statute to the informer. Marvinv. Trout, 212.

9. Police power to regulate business carried on within State, to protect public health and welfare.
A State has the right, in the exercise of the police power, and with a view to protect the public health and welfare, to make reasonable regula-
tions in regard to such occupations as may, if unrestrained, become unsafe or dangerous, and the conferring of discretionary power upon administrative boards to grant or withhold permission to carry on such a trade or business is not violative of the Fourteenth Amendment. There is no presumption that a power granted to an administrative
board will be arbitrar~ily or improperly exercised, and this court will not interfere with the exercise of such a power where the record does not disclose any ground on which the board acted. It is primarily for the State to select the businesses to be regulated and if those selected are proper subjects for regulation, those engaged therein are not denied the equal protection of the laws because other businesses are not subjected to similar regulations, provided all engaged in the same business are treated alike. Lieberman v. Van De Carr, 552.

10. Police power to exact license fee for sale of intoxicating liquors on vessel engaged in interstate commerce.
Since the passage of the Wilson Act of August 8, 1890, 26 Stat. 313, there is a distinction between the right to sell intoxicating liquors on vessels engaged in interstate commerce and other businesses conducted on such vessels. Under the provisions of that act a State may, in the exercise of its police powers, exact a license fee as a condition of the right to sell intoxicating liquors over the bar on board of a steamboat while within the boundaries of the State, notwithstanding such boat is navigating the Mississippi River and is engaged in interstate com-

INDEX.

merce. Such a license fee is not a tax on the boat, crew, passengers or liquor sold, nor a fee for navigating the river, the imposition of which would be an interference with the commerce clause of the Constitution, nor does it in any way violate the freedom of the navigation of the Mississippi River as guaranteed by treaties and statutes. The fact that the boat is personal property owned by a corporation of another State does not make it a part of the territory of that State, and exempt those thereon from the police regulations of another State in regard to the sale of intoxicating liquor while within the boundaries of the latter State. Foppiano v. Speed,'501.

11. Executive power to grant reprieves. The Governor of Vermont has ample power to grant reprieves to persons
sentenced to death for murder. Rogers v. Peck, 425.

STATUTES. A. CONSTRUCTION OF.
1. Effect on validity of special act of disregard in its enactment of requirements of general law.
A general law enacted by a legislature may be repealed, amended or disregarded by a subsequent legislature, and a special act is not necessarily invalid because the legislature dispensed with certain formalities required by a general law in regard to the passage of such act. Manigault v. Springs, 473.

2. Repeal by implication. The rules that repeal by implication are not favored and that a repeal will
not be implied unless there be an irreconcilable conflict between the two statutes, applies especially where the prior h~w is a special act relating to a particular case or subject and the subsequent law Ig general in it -operation. The special provisions of the act of March 2, 1887, 24 Stat. 442, relating to judicial districts of Illinois, were not repealed by the general terms of the Judiciary Act of March 3, 1887, 24 Stat.

STREETS AND SIDEWALKS. 1. Equality in use of. Public sidewalks and streets are for use by all on equal terms for proper
purposes subject to valid regulations prescribed by the constituted authorities. The rights of a railroad company as abutting owner of the sidewalks adjacent to the property on which its station stands and those of its passengers are not paramou nt to the rights of the general public to legitimbitely use the sidewalk, and licensed hackmen unless forbidden by local regulations may, within reasonable limits, use a public sidewalk in propqrly prosecuting their calling so long as such use does not obstruct others in legitimately using it upon equal terms. Donovan v. Pennsylvania Company, 279.
2. Injunction to restrainuse of. Where there is a continuing trespass by a number of parties, and a suit of
law could only determine a particular controversy at a particular time, a court of equity may meet such an unusual emergency and by a comprehensive decree determine finally the controversy between the parties, avoid a multiplicity of suits and conserve the public interest; and so held that the Pennsylvania Company could maintain a suit against hackmen combined together in disregard of its regulations, enjoining them from congregating upon the sidewalk adjacent to its terminal at Chicago so as to interfere with the ingress and egress of passengers. lb.

tion, and a tax otherwise legal on surface street railroad franchises does not deprive the owners thereof of the equal protection of the laws because subsurface street railroad franchises are not subjected to a similar tax. ' Metropolitan Street Ry. Co. v. New York, 1,
2. Constitutionality of New York Franchise Tax Law. The tax law of New York as amended May 26, 1899, c. 712, p. 1589, im-
posing taxes on certain public franchises is not repugnant, so far as the franchises in this ca.:e are involved, to the equar protection, due process, or impairment of obligation clauses of the Federal Constitution and of the Fourteenth Amendment thereto. b.
3. Exemptions-License fee as equivalent of property tax. A license fee is a charge for the privilege of carrying on a business or occu-
pation and is not the equivalent or in lieu of a property tax, and a provision in the grant of a franchise for a license fee does not, in the absence of express stipulations of exemption, relieve the property employed in the business from the ordinary burdens of property taxation and amount to a contract of exemption from further taxation, within the impairment of contract clause of the Federal Constitution. Brooklyn City R. R. Co. v. New York, 48.
5. Valuation o1 property for taxation; failure to require return affecting constitutionality of law.
The legislation challenged in this case, being in terms an amendment of the general tax law of New York and subject to the provisions of that law in respect to notice and review by certiorari of the action of the assessing board, is not obnoxious to the charge of a lack of due process of law; nor is due process shown to be wanting by a failure to require a return of the valuation of the franchise held by a corporation separately from that of the tangible property held under the franchise. b.
6. Exemptions from taxation;power of State as to. Nothing in the Federal Constitution prevents a State from granting ex-
emptions from taxation; and the reduction, upon equitable considerations, of payments made in the nature of taxes by certain corporations on their franchises from the amount to which they are subjected by a general law does not entitle every franchise owner to a similar reduction And render the tax invalid because it denies the holders of some franchises the equal protection of the law or deprives them of their property without due process of law. Metropolitan Street Ry.Co. v. New York, 1.
7. Effect of omission to tax on power to tax. The omission of the legislature for one year, or for a series of years, to tax
certain classes of property, otherwise taxable, does not destroy the power of the State to subject them to taxation when it sees fit to do so. lb.
8. Franchises and other intangible property subject to taxation by StateBurden of proof as to situs without State of property sought to be taxed.
Presumptively all property within the territorial limits of a State is subvor.. cxcix-42

INDEX.
ject to its taxing power and the burden of proof is on one claiming that any particular property is by contract or otherwise beyond the reach thereof; and, growing out of the conditions of modern business a large proportion of valuable property is now to be found in intangible things such as franchises, which are, like other property, subject to taxation. Ib.
9. Grants of franchises not to be construed as by implication exempting from taxation.
In grants from the public nothing passes by implication, and, in the absence of direct stipulations relinquishing the right of taxation, a provision, in grants of privileges or franchises, that the grantee shall pay nothing therefor is not to be construed as an equivalent or substitute for taxes amounting to a contract of exemption from future :taxation within the impairment clause of the Federal Constitution. Ib.
10. Application of maxim mobilia sequuntur personam in respect of taxation. The proper use of a legal fiction is to prevent injustice and the maxim
mobilia sequuntur personam may only be resorted to when convenience and justice so require. That doctrine does not apply to tangible personal property permanently located in another State where it is employed and protected, acquires a situs and is'subject to be there taxed irrespective of the domicil of the owner; and an attempt on the part of the State in which the owner is domiciled to tax such property amounts to a deprivation of property without due process of law within the purview of the Fourteenth Amendment. So held in regard to the taxation of cars owned by a transit refrigerating company and which were permanently employed without the State in which the company was domiciled. Union Transit Co. v. Kentucky, 194.
11. Equivalent assumed in exercise of power of taxation, without which tax invalid.
The power of taxation is exercised upon the assumption of an equivalent rendered in the protection of the property and person of the taxpayer, and if such equivalent cannot possibly be rendered because the property taxed is wholly beyond the jurisdiction of the taxing power the taxation thereof within the domicil of the owner amounts to a taking of property without due process of law. While there may be individual cases where the weight of the tax necessarily falls unequally on account of special circumstances the general rule is that in classifying property for taxation, some benefit to the property taxed is a controlling consideration, and a plain abuse of the power in this respect may justify judicial interference.
