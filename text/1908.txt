to settle the controversy between the parties, and that it was only when they failed to settle that service of summons was made upon Mason, as the agent of the company. There is testimony tending to show that both parties expected an adjustment of the claim to be made at this meeting, which was held for that purpose. There is testimony from which it might be inferred that there was a bona fide offer to permit an examination at that time of the remains of the deceased. We do not feel authorized to find as against the testimony set forth in the 'bill of exceptions, and the finding of the court below, that the purpose in writing the letter of February 20, and procuring authority to be conferred upon Dr. Mason to settle the case, and to come into the State of Missouri for that purpose, was a mere fraudulent scheme to obtain service upon the insurance company.
As the sole question before us pertains to the sufficiency of the service under the facts disclosed, we reach the conclusion that the judgment of the Circuit Court must be affirmed.

condition of a testator is for the trial judge who has all the evidence and the witness before him, and in this case the trial judge does not seem to have abused his discretion as to the admission of testimony. Evidence as to an alleged delusion of testator thirty years before execution of the will held to be properly excluded both because of remoteness and of the tendency to raise a collateral issue as to whether the statements connected therewith were or were not actually false. Where the wife as caveator attacks testator's soundness of mind because he referred to himself at times as a widower and at times as divorced, an agreement of separation and a deed referring to himself as widower admitted solely to explain why testator so referred to himself held competent for that purpose, but evidence by the wife as to her reasons for signing the agreement and other instruments, in which she joined with her husband as his wife, were properly excluded. The admission of incompetent evidence is not re'versible error if subsequently it is distinctly withdrawn from the jury, and so held in this case where a letter was erroneously admitted but the presiding judge, at request of the party objecting to its admission, instructed the jury that nothing in such letter was to be taken as evidence of truth of the statements therein or even to be used for purposes of crossexamination. 29 App. D.

MR. JUSTICE MOODY delivered the opinion of the court.
In this case we are asked to review, on appeal and writ of error, a judgment of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, affirming a decree of the Supreme Court of the District sitting as a Probate Court, which admitted to probate certain paper writings purporting to be the will and codicils thereto

TURNER v. AMERICAN SECURITY & TRUST CO. 259

213 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

of Henry E. Woodbury. The decree was based upon the findings of a jury upon two issues submitted to it, namely:
"(1.) At the time of the execution of the said several paper
writings propounded for probate as the last will and testament of Henry E. Woodbury, deceased, was the said Henry E. Woodbury of sound and disposing mind and capable of making a valid deed or contract?
" (2.) Was execution of said.paper writings procured by the fraud or undue influence of Sallie Woodbury, Mena Stevens, or either of them, or any other person or persons?"
The jury found that the testator was of sound mind and that he was not unduly influenced. The questions brought here arose upon the trial of those issues and are stated in the bill of exceptions duly allowed. There are nineteen assignments of error, relating to the admission or exclusion of evidence, and to the instructions or refusal of instructions to the jury. There was conflicting evidence upon the issues. As no question of the sufficiency of the evidence of either party is properly here, a brief preliminary statement of facts is sufficient, and any other facts which may be needed to explain the questions of law will be stated in connection with the disposition of those questions.
According to the practice in the District in a contest of this kind, those propounding the instrument for probate are called ca-eatees and those .opposing its probate caveators.
The testator, Henry E. Woodbury, died January 15, 1905, seventy-nine years of age. The will was executed April 11, 1902, and five codicils were executed at different times from January 5, 1903, to December 20, 1904. With slight exceptions, the will and codicils devise and bequeath the real and personal property to charities. The testator had been a physician until 1881, when an injury compelled him to cease the practice of his profession. He was childless. He had married in 1870, and in less than two years had parted from his wife, and thereafter they lived separately, though without being divorced. A sister, Sallie Woodbury, lived with him until her death, in December; 1902. After the death of the sister, Mena M. Stevens became

his housekeeper and nurse. A nephew, Molyneaux L. Turner, was his heir and next of kin. His wife survived the testator, and, with the nephew, filed a caveat against the probate of the paper writings purporting to be a will and codicils.
1. The first eleven assignments of error relate to the admission or exclusion by the trial court of the testimony of lay witnesses as to their opinion for or against the mental capacity of the testator. In the view we take of these assignments of error they may be considered together, and without any statement as to the testimony of the several witnesses.
The rule governing the admission of testimony of this char-' acter, which has been prescribed by this court for the courts of the United States, is easy of statement and administration. Where the issue is whether a person is of sound or unsound mind, a lay witness, who has had an adequate opportunity to observe the speech and other conduct of that person may, in addition to relating the significant instances of speech and conduct, testify to the opinion on the mental capacity formed at the time from such observation. Insurance Co. v. Rodel, 95 U. S. 232; Connecticut Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Lathrop, 111 U. S. 612; Queenan v. Oklahoma, 190 U. S. 548. In no other way than this can the full knowledge of an unprofessional witness with regard to the issue be placed before the jury, because ordinarily it is impossible for such witness to give an adequate description of all the appearances which to him have indicated sanity or insanity. Such testimony has been well described as a compendious mode of ascertaining the result of the actual observations of witnesses. Ordinarily, and perhiaps necessarily, the witness in testifying to his opportunities for observation and his actual observation relates more or less fully the instances of his conversation or dealings with the person whose mental capacity is under consideration, and it is, of course, cmpetent, either upbn direct or cross-examination, to elicit those instances in detail.
The order of the evidence must be left to the discretion of the trial judge, but when sufficient appears to convince the

TURNER v. AMERICAN SECURITY & TRUST CO. 261

213 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

trial judge that the witness has had an opportunity for adequate observation of the person's mental capacity, and has actually observed it, then the judge may permit him to testify to his opinion. This was the course pursued by the trial judge in this case. With respect to each witness, whose testimony as to opinion was admitted or excluded, the judge exercised his discretion upon the qualifying testimony.
We are asked to review that discretion and to say,that in the case of the eleven witnesses before us it was improperly exercised. We have no hesitation in declining to do this. No general rule can well be framed which will govern all cases, and an attempt to do that would multiply exceptions and new trials. The responsibility for the exercise of the judicial power of determining whether a given witness has the qualifications which will permit him, to the profit of the jury, to state his opinion upon an issue of this kind, may best be left with the judge presiding at the trial, who has a comprehensive view of the issue and of all of the evidence and the witness himself before his face.
This is not to say that in a very clear case an appellate court ought not to review the discretion of the trial judge. For instance, if it should appear that the witness had never spoken to the testator or seen any significant act, but merely observed him driving from day to day through the streets, and the opinion of such a witness as to sanity had been received, it would be the duty of the appellate court to correct the errgr. On the other hand, if the witness for years had been in constant communication with the testator, had frequently conversed with him and observed his conduct from day to day, the exclusion of the opinion of the witness ought to be corrected by the appellate court. These are instances of a plain abuse of judicial discretion.
The true rule of action for an appellate court is stated in Wheeler v. United States, 159 U. S. 523. In that case this court was considering the admissibility, upon the trial of an indictment for murder, of the testimony of a boy hve and a

half years old at the time of the trial. The court, speaking by' Mr. Justice Brewer, said (p. 524):
"The decision of this question rests primarily with the trial
judge, who sees the proposed witness, notices his manner, his apparent possession or lack of intelligence, and may resort to any examination which will tend to disclose his capacity and intelligence as well as his understanding of the obligations of an oath. As many of these matters cannot be photographed into the record, the decision of the trial judge will not be disturbed on review unless from that which is preserved it is clear that it was erroneous."
Though the question of competency in that case differed materially from the questions of competency in this case, the spirit which underlies the statement of the court there ought to govern here.
We have examined these eleven assignments of error and brought them to the test of the foregoing principles. We find that no admissions of exclusions of -testimony were clearly erroneous, and accordingly all the assignments are overruled.
2. The caveators, on the issue of unsoundness of mind of the testator in 1902, and the following years, offered inevidence the record in a suit for divorce brought by the testator in 1872, and more especially that part of the record wherein he alleged, -as a ca'use for divorce, that his wife was incapable of a valid marriage on accoimt of a physical malformation. The physicians appointed by the court reported, after an examination of the wife, that the condition alleged did not exist. The offer of this evidence was accompanied by the contention that it showed a delusion on the part of the testator. The evidence was excluded and we think rightly, either upon the ground that it was too remote in point of time or that it would lead to a collateral inquiry whether the statement was actually false, and if so, whether it was the result of a delusion, or of malice or
falsehood. 3. The caveators had introduced evidence that the testator
had spoken of himself as a widower and as having been divorced

213 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

from his wife, both of which statements were untrue. Obviously, the testimony that these statements had been made by the testator could only have been admitted as proof of mental unsoundness. To meet this testimony, and the inference which might be drawn from it, the judge admitted in evidence a written agreement made in 1887 by the testator with his wife. The material parts of the agreement follow:
"Witnesseth: That, whereas the said Anna L. Woodbury is seized and possessed of certain lands and real estate in her own right in the city of Washington, D. C., and Cambridge, Mass.; and whereas the said Anna L. Woodbury desires to be able to sell, dispose of and convey the same as she could were she a femme sole; and whereas she is unable to do so unless by and with the consent and agreement of her said husband aforesaid, Henry E. Woodbury;
"Now, therefore, it is agreed by these presents that the said Henry E. Woodbury will permit the said Anna L. Woodbury to sell, dispose of and convey any and all of her real estate as at any time she may desire to do; and in consideration of this relinquishment of all right, title, interest and claim of him, the said Henry E. Woodbury, in and to, the property and lands of the said Anna L. Woodbury, the said Anna L. Woodbury hereby covenants and agrees for herself, her heirs and assigns, to relinquish all and every right, title, interest and claim that she (or they through her) may have to any and to all of the property
personal or real that the said Henry E. Woodbury possesses now or may hereafter acquire, tog'ether with her right of dower in any estate the said Henry E. Woodbury may leave in case of his demise. And she the said Anna L. Woodbury further covenants and agrees with the said Henry E. Woodbury, that under no circumstances will the said Anna LI.:Woodbury ask for, demand or claim from him alimony or a support for any time past, present or to come.
"In short this covenant and agreement is intended to restore to each of the aforesaid parties-Anna L. Woodbury and Henry E. Woodbury-the same right to contract, to use or to dispose

213 U. S.

of their respective properties, lands and estates-personal and real-as they possessed before they were married."
Counsel for the caveatees offered this to explain the statements of the testator, and urged its admission in connection with the fact of separation. The caveators' counsel objected to it, because it showed neither a divorce nor that the testator was a widower. The judge then said: "I think it may be competent to explain the situation here, and I Will admit it." The judge further said: "inasmuch as you have itwo contradictory statements from him, I think this may come in in response to that." Counsel for the caveatees, in the course of the 'discussion, said: "We have a right to shdw the relations existing between Dr. Woodbury and members of his family," but the court did not assent to this proposition and made no response to it.
We think it is clear that this agreement was admitted solely for the purpose of explaining the testator's statement about his divorce and widowerhood. If the caveators wished to limit its use, any further than it was limited by the judge'in the ruling admitting it, an instruction to the jury should have been asked. We think it is competent for the purpose for which it was offered and admitted, and that its weight was for the jury. In it the wife relinquished all claims to her husband's property, real or personal, and all right to dower or of alimony, or of other support, and concluded by saying: "This covenant and agreement is intended to restore to each of the aforesaid paies--Anna L. Woodbury and Henry E. Woodbury-the same right to. contract, to use or to dispose of their respective properties, lands and estates-personal and real-as they possessed before they were married." Though the weight of this evidence might have been slight, we think the evidence was competent.
4. The caveators, for the purpose of explaining the signature by the wife to the agreement of 1887, then offered to prove by her deposition that she had been advised by physicians, now dead, to sign any paper that the testator wished her to sign, and that it was the mania of the testator to be rid of her and

TURNER i. AMERICAN SECURITY & TRUST CO. 265

Opinion of the Court.

her .property, and that the testator had said to them that he would die if he could not get rid of both. This testimony was excluded, and we think rightly. The motive of the wife in signing the agreement of 1887 was entirely immaterial. She did sign it, and it was admitted solely for the purpose of explaining the testator's statement that he was a widower and had been divorced.
5. The facts upon which the next assignment of error is based are very obscure. Mena M. Stevens, the nurse, was called as a witness by the caveatees. Upon cross-examination, she testified that in 1903 and 1904 she had received from the testator gifts of certain stock and a deed to certain lands, whose rental value was $21.90 per month. The deed was delivered to a person to keep for the nurse until the testator's death. This deed was offered in evidence by the caveators. It was dated September 12, 1904. The testator described himself in this deed as a widower. Thereupon caveatees put in evidence, without objection, a deed from Henry E. Woodbury and Anna L. Woodbury, his wife, to the American Security and Trust Company, dated November 18,. 1903. Whether this deed included the same land conveyed to Stevens we are unable to tell from the descriptions, but we assume it did not. The purpose for which the deed was offered does not appear. As it was admitted just prior to the admission of the agreement of 1887, and subsequent to the admission of the deed to Stevens, in which the testator called himself a widower, we may fairly assume that, like the agreement of 1887, it was offered to explain the use of the word "widower." There is nothing in the bill of exceptions to show that it was used for any other purpose, and we treat it as limited to that purpose.
The caveators offered, by the deposition of the wife, to prove the same explanation of this deed as was offered for the agreement of 1887, but the evidence was excluded. We think that the caveators have not shown that the excluded evidence was competent, and' we therefore overrule this assignment of error.
It should be said generally of this and the preceding assign-

Opinion of the Court.

213 U. S.'

ment of error that there is nothing to show that the instruments were received or used as evidence that the wife regarded the testator as of sound mind and capable of transacting business. There was, therefore, no occasion to offer evidence to explain the act and destroy the effect of the admission. The whole argument for the admissibility of. the explanatory evidence is based upon the theory that the instruments were offered to show the wife's belief as to his mental condition-a theory which finds no support in the bill of exceptions. If the instrument had been admitted and used for that purpose a different question would be presented:
6. Turner was called as a witness in his own behalf. On cross-examination he was asked if he had made certain insulting remarks to his aunt, Sallie Woodbury. He replied that he had not. He was then shown a paper and asked if it was in his aunt's handwriting, and replied that it was, and was a letter addressed to William H. Turner. He was then asked, over the objection and under the exception of the caveators, whether the letter did not assert that the witness had made the insulting statements. The cross-examining counsel was then permitted to read the letter for the purpose of examining the witness upon the statements contained in it. This was done over objection and under exception. The letter stated that the witness had made the insulting remarks which he had denied making. The cross-examining counsel proceeded: "Now, do you mean that that statement by her is untrue?" Answer: "I do not remember making any such statement; I am not in the habit of using any such language."
It is too clear for discussion that the use permitted to be made of this letter was erroneous, and if the matter had stopped there we should be compelled to grant a new trial. The presiding judge, however, instructed the jury in behalf of the caveators, and, it would seem, at their request, as follows:
"While the caveator was allowed by the court to be crossexamined as to the statements contained in an undated letter, purporting to have been written by his aunt, Sallie Woodbury,

TURNER v. AMERICAN SECURITY & TRUST CO. 267

213 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

addressed to William H. Turner, the jury are instructed that neither the said letter nor the use thereof so allowed by the court to be made upon the cross-examination of the caveator is to be taken as evidence of the truth of any of the said statements in said letter contained or allowed to be used for the purpose of cross-examination as aforesaid."
The general rule is that the admission of incompetent evidence is not reversible error if it subsequently is distinctly withdrawn from the consideration of the jury. Pennsylvania Co. v. Roy, 102 U. S. 451,458; Hopt v. Utah, 120 U. S. 430, 438. There are cases which emphasize the necessity of clearly and unmistakably withdrawing the evidence from the consideration of the jury. Washington Gas Light Co. v. Lansden, 172 U. S. 535, 554; Throckmorton v. Holt, 180 U. S. 552, 567. But we are satisfied that this was done in this case, and that the instruction cured the error. It directed that the'letter should not. be taken as evidence of the truth of any of its statements or even allowed to be used for the purpose of cross-examination.
7. The remaining assignments of error relate to two instructions given to the jury and the refusal of an instruction requested by the caveators. None of the questions raised here touches upon any vital part of the case, and, while not waived, they were not much insisted upon in argument. An examination of the charge satisfies us that it contained all that the caveators were entitled to and that it was correct, full and adequate to present the issues to the jury. We will not prolong this opinion beyond what was said in the court below on this subject, which we approve.
Judgment affirmed.

ters are more remote from the water front, and that many women and children spend the day in that section, and the opinion is not strained that an undiscovered fire at night might cause great loss of life in a very high apartment house in that district. These are matters which it must be presumed were known by the legislature, and whether or not such were the facts was a question, among others, for the legislature to determine. They are asserted as facts in the brief of the counsel for the City of Boston. If they are, it would seem that ample justification is therein found for the passage of the statutes, and that the plaintiff in error is not entitled to compensation for the reasonable interference with his property rights by the statutes. That in addition to these sufficient facts, considerations of an Tsthetic nature also entered into the reasons for their passage, would not invalidate them. Under these circumstances there is no unreasonable interference with the rights of property of the plaintiff in error, nor do the statutes deprive him of the equal protection of the laws. The reasons contained in the opinion of the state court are in our view sufficient to justify their enactment. The judgment is therefore

No. 174. Submitted April 20, 1909.-Decided May 17, 1909.
Which is the correct English translation of a will written in the Hawaiian language is a pure question of fact, and in this case this court follows its usual course in regard to the findings of fact of both the lower courts and adopts the translation which both found to be correct.
The will of a childless testatrix, who lived with her husband in the

GRAY v. NOHOLOA.

Statement of the Case.

leper colony of Hawaii leaving all her property to her husband, was rightfully construed as relating to all property whether situated in that colony or outside thereof, it not being presumed that she died intestate as to any of her property or that she would limit her bounty to her husband by omitting any of her property. 18 Hawaii, 265, affirmed.

THE appellant herein appeals from the decree of the Supreme Court of the Territory of Hawaii. The facts relating to the case are as follows:
Hikaalani Hobron Noholoa was a resident of the island of Molokai, Territory of Hawaii, which is called the leper settlement, and was a leper, about seventy-five years of age, at the time of her death, on or about the twenty-ninth of June, 1906. Deceased left a husband, who was also a resident of the settlement and a leper, and a niece, the appellant, Kaimiola Nakookoo Gray, also residing on the island, and two grandnieces, being minors, residing in Honolulu. She left a will, written in the Hawaiian language, of which the following was taken as a translation by the courts below:
"I, the undersigned, a leper residing at Kalaupapa, Island of Molokai, Territory of Hawaii, do make this my Last Will for all property known belonging to me and appearing in my name situate at Kalaupapa aforesaid, with good will (or intention,) do hereby bequeath the same as hereinafter described: One gray horse, one bay mare; one black mare; one frame wooden house and other houses owned by me, as well as all other property owned by me, to my husband David Noholoa, residing at Kalaupapa aforesaid, to him and to his heirs, administrators and executors forever. Renouncing all claims that my relatives may set up in law to this."
The above will was duly admitted to probate in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit of the Territory on the twelfth day of December, 1906, and, upon petition duly made, the court granted letters of administration with the will annexed to Enoch Johnson, who thereupon received such letters and entered upon his duties as such administrator,

OCTOBER TERM, 1908.

Statement of the Case.

214 U. S.

After the application on the part of the husband for the probate of the will of his wife, and after the filing of the same with the clerk of the Circuit Court, but before the granting of letters of administration to Enoch Johnson, as prayed for by the husband, a petition was filed with the same court by Kaimiola Nakookoo Gray, the appellant herein, and a niece of the deceased testatrix, in which petition it was averred that the will of the testatrix, which was offered for probate, did not dispose of any property other than which was within and at the leper settlement, and that the testatrix at the time of her death owned other property outside of the settlement of the assessed value of several thousand dollars, and it was averred that there was no person who could lawfully demand settlement of the people who had possession of the property outside of the settlement, and therefore the petitioner asked for the appointment of some suitable person as administrator of the estate of which decedent died intestate, and that due notice might be given thereof.
Subsequently to the filing of this petition the probate court duly admitted the will as translated by the court to probate, and also denied the petition of the niece for letters of administration upon that portion of the land of deceased which she asserted was not included in the will. The translation of the will which she put in evidence in her proceeding, was the same one that was made by the court in the proceeding to admit the will to probate.
Kaimiola Nakookoo Gray duly appealed from the order or decree of the probate court refusing to grant letters of administration, as petitioned for, and the appeal was duly argued, without objection, in the Supreme Court of the Territory upon* the same translation of the will, and the decree was affirmed.
A motion was then made for a rehearing of the case, and upon that motion, for the first time, ex parte affidavits were used on behalf of the appellant in regard to the translation of the will of testatrix. These affidavits asserted that the translation adopted, and most of it made, by the probate court, and

Opinion of the Court.

adopted by the Supreme Court upon the hearing, without protest or question on her part, was not an accurate translation, and the following was asserted to be the true translation:
"I, the undersigned, a leper residing at Kalaupapa, Island of Molokai, Territory of Hawaii, make this my last testament concerning all chattels known as mine and in my possession, being in Kalaupapa aforementioned; with sane mind I bequeath all those said goods of mine described as follows, to wit,
"1 Creamed colored horse, "1 Bay mare, "1 Black mare, "1 Wooden house together with certain other houses, and all other chattels belonging to me, to my husband, David Noholoa, residing at said Kalaupapa and to his heirs and assigns forever. My heirs shall not have any right to claim these at law. "In witness whereof I hereunto subscribe my name this 18th day of November, 1901." The court refused to accept such translation or to set aside or correct the translation already made and adopted by it, and thereupon denied the motion for a rehearing, Frear, Chief Justice, dissenting. From the decree of affirmance, Kaimiola Nakookoo Gray has appealed to this court.

Mr. David L. Withington, Mr. J. Alfred Magoon and Mr. J. Lightfoot for appellant.

Mr. William L. Stanley, Mr. Clarence H. Olson and Mr. Henry Holmes for appellee.

Mn. JUSTICE PECKHAM, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court.

The sole question in this case is whether property which belonged to testatrix in her lifetime, and was situated outside

OCTOBER TERM, 1908.

Opinion of the Court.

214 U. S.

of the leper island, or settlement, at the time of her death passed by her will.
The appellant asserts that the translation of the will, although made by one and adopted by both courts below without opposition, and offered on her part in this proceeding, both in the trial court and upon review, is, nevertheless, inaccurate; that the translation which she submitted in her motion for a rehearing, as contained in certain ex parte affidavits, is the more accurate of the two, and if it were adopted the original will in such case, as so translated, would not dispose of any property which belonged to the testatrix at the time of her death, situated outside of the leper settlement; and, as no executor was appointed in the will, the petition of the appellant for the appointment of an administrator with the will annexed as to all outside property of which the testatrix died intestate should, as she claims, have been granted, and to that end the order should be reversed.
What is the correct English translation of the original will in this case, written in the Hawaiian language, is a pure question of fact.
The record shows that Judge Kepoikai, judge of the probate branch of the Circuit Court, Second Circuit, himself translated, at least in part, the will now before us for construction. The record discloses no objection or opposition to such translation, or any criticism of its accuracy at that time. The Supreme Court, on appeal, used the same translation, without criticism or opposition, as had been used by the trial court, and, upon that translation, affirmed the decree. Mr. Justice Hartwell, in writing the opinion of the Supreme Court, said: "The original of the will shows more clearly than does the evidently defective translation that the intention was to dispose of 'also all the other property known to be mine.' The decedent evidently knew well what her property at Kalaupapa was, and there is no reason to suppose she did not know of the property in Honolulu." So that whether the translation adopted by the court below and the Supreme Court was defective or not, the

COLLINS v. O'NEIL.

214 U. S.

Syllabus.

view of the latter court was that a correct translation showed the intention of the testatrix to dispose of all her property, or, as the court said, "also all the other property known to be mine."
As the two courts below have determined the question of fact, we follow our usual course in such cases and adopt the translation of the will which they have adopted.
The legal question then arising is, what did the testatrix mean by her will? Her intention is to be derived from her language, and we are of opinion that the lower court was correct in its construction as given to us.
A perusal of the will as translated and adopted by the courts below leaves us in no doubt that the testatrix's intention was to give to her husband, not only the property which she left situated at Kalaupapa, but also all other property owned by her, wherever it might be situated and whatever it might be. We do not think she intended to die intestate as to any portion of her property, or to limit her bounty to her husband to such property only as was situated at Kalaupapa.
The decree of the Supreme Court of the Territory is therefore
Affirmed.

No. 120. Argued March 19, 22, 1909.-Decided May 17, 1909.
The mere fact that a constitutional question is alleged does not suffice to give this court jurisdiction of a direct appeal from the Circuit Court if such question is unsubstantial and so clearly devoid of merit as to be clearly frivolous. Farrellv. O'Brien, 199 U. S. 100.
A probate proceeding by which jurisdiction of the probate court is asserted over a decedent's estate for the purpose of administration is in the nature of a proceeding in rem, as to which all the world is charged with notice; the law of California conforms to this rule.
Even though the power of the State to prescribe length of notice be not absolute, a notice authorized by the legislature will only be set aside as ineffectual on account of shortness of time in a clear case. Bellingham Bay Co. v. New Whatcom, 172 U. S. 314.
Whether or not a State can arbitrarily determine by statute the length of notice to be given of steps in the administration of estates in the custody of its courts, ten days' notice for the settlement of the final accounts of an executor and action on final distribution is not so unreasonable as to be wanting in due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment; and so held that the contention that §§ 1633 and 1634 of the Civil Code of California prescribing such length of notice are unconstitutional as depriving a distributee of his property without due process of law is without merit. Roller v. Holly, 176 U. S. 398, distinguished.

In Roller v. holly, 176 U. S. 398, five days' personal service on a defendant residing in Virginia was made of a process issued in Texas, and the court in holding it insufficient said that a man is entitled to some notice before he can be deprived of his liberty or property is an axiom of the law to which no citation of authority would give additional weight. It is manifest that the requirement of notice would be of no value whatever, unless such notice were reasonable and adequate for the purpose. Citing Davidson v. New Orleans, 96 U. S.97; Hagarv. ReclamationDist., 111 U. S.701, 712.
The notice, even if it had been served upon him personally, would not have given appellant an opportunity to make a proper appearance in court, and due process of law has been repeatedly interpreted by this court to mean not only that a party shall have notice, but that he shall have a reasonable and fair opportunity of being heard. Hagar v. Reclamation Dist., 111 U. S.722.

Mr. J. W. Dorsey and Mr. Henry E. Davis, with whom Mr. Henry Ach was on the brief, for appellees:
No question of a Federal nature is involved in this case. It is not a matter of National concern whether or not succession in cases of intestacy shall be determined under the ancient rules of the civil, the common, or the Scotch law, or through restricted and arbitrary rules of the local government. Who are heirs of a deceased person is determined and declared by statute. As the heir takes by the grace of the State, he can only take to the extent and under the procedure established by the State, which has entire freedom of choice as to the selection of persons who shall stand as heirs at law or beneficiaries of a decedent, intestate or testate, as well as the methods and procedure by and through which succession is

effected. No fundamental rights are involved in probate proceedings. In matters of this sort the power to limit involves the power to dispense with limitations. Allen v. Georgia, 166 U. S. 138; Hovey v. Elliott, 167 U. S. 409; Wilson v. North Carolina,169 U. S. 586.
The probate jurisdiction of the Superior Court is essentially a jurisdiction under the control of the state legislature which the law-making power may enlarge or restrict, and it necessarily follows that opportunity to be heard, accorded by the statute of the State controlling the subject-matter, is sufficient to constitute due process of law. Lent v. Tillson, 72 California, 404.
As said by Mr. Chief Justice Waite, due process of law is process according to the law of the land. This process in the States is regulated by the law of the State. Walker v. Sauvinet, 92 U. S. 90.
It necessarily follows, that if any notice is given, or its service made, in pursuance of the requirements of the statute, it cannot be violative of any inherent or constitutional right of the persons affected thereby, and hence must be in accord with the law of the land, and amount to due process of law.

The sufficiency of the notice must be determined in each case from the particular circumstance of the case in hand. Davidson v. New Orleans, 96 U. S. 97.
The objects of probate proceedings are to administer, settle and distribute, the estates of deceased persons, and our system contemplates that these objects shall be accomplished with reasonable dispatch-that the administration shall be speedily accomplished, and closed, and the estate devolve to a new and competent ownership.

MR. JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the court.
Upon demurrers, the court below dismissed the bill filed by Goodrich, the appellant, for want of equitable jurisdiction to grant the relief which was prayed. 145 Fed. Rep. 844. To review that decree this appeal direct to this court is prosecuted. Jurisdiction to review is challenged. That question therefore at the outset requires attention.
To clarify the issue for decision, instead of reciting the allegations of the bill in the order in which they are therein stated, we shall briefly recapitulate the facts alleged in their chronological order, in so far as essential to be borne in mind for the purpose of the question of our jurisdiction.
In February, 1886, Thomas H. Williams, a resident of California, died in San Francisco, leaving as his lawful*heirs four

Opinion of the Court.

sons, viz., Sherrod, Thomas H., Jr., Percy and Bryant, and one daughter, Mary, who was the wife of Frank S. Johnson. The wife of the deceased and the mother of his children had died before him. Williams left an estate of large value, com-
posed principally of real property. Shortly after his death, on April 2, 1886, in the court having probate jurisdiction in San Francisco, a last will and codicil thereto of Williams were duly admitted to probate. Leaving out of view certain bequests of personal property and small legacies in money, the estate was principally disposed of as follows: The title of the property was vested in the executor and trustee named in the will, George E. Williams, a brother of the deceased, for the purpose of making the distribution which the will provided. To one of the sons, Sherrod, nothing was given. It was provided that the sum of $50,000 should be absolutely vested in the son Percy, that $200,000 should "be set aside absolutely" for the benefit of the daughter Mary, wife of Johnson, and that $100,000 should be set aside for the benefit of each of the sons, Thomas H., Jr., Percy and Bryant. The will, however, provided that the gifts to the children above stated, other than the gift of $50,000, which was to vest absolutely in Percy, were only intended for the use and benefit of the children to whom they were given during their respective lives, with the remainder in fee to the lineal descendants, or if none such, to the surviving brothers or sister, as the case might be. The residuum of the estate was directed to be set aside in equal shares for the benefit of the daughter and two of the sons (Thomas H., Jr., and Percy) during their respective lives, with the remainder in fee as heretofore recited. The will contained the following clause :
"Item 4. When the term of three years after my death, shall have elapsed, unless the executor, herein named, shall for good cause extend it for two years, or in case there be another executor, three of my children, or representatives, shall by writing, extend it for two years, distribution of my estate, shall be made, as herein directed."

OCTOBER TERM, 1908.

Opinion of the Court.

214 U. S.

Until the setting aside or distribution thus directed the executor was authorized to advance monthly to the daughter the sum of $250, and to each of the three sons $100. The executor was authorized to carry on the business in which the testator was engaged at the time of his death, and extensive powers were conferred in regard to the sale and reinvestment of the property to be set aside for the benefit of the children, etc. George E. Williams qualified as executor and entered upon the performance of his duties.
In 1888 one of the sons, Sherrod, died unmarried and without issue. In the same year Frank S. Johnson, the husband of Mary, the daughter, obtained a decree of divorce against his wife, by which he was awarded the custody of an infant son, Frank Hanson Johnson, the issue of the marriage. In December of the following year Mary, the divorced wife, married George G. Goodrich, and thereafter lived with him in the city of New York. The son Percy was married in August, 1888; a child was born in 1889, but died the year following; and Percy died on October 3, 1890, leaving his widow surviving. Bryant Williams, another son, died in May, 1893, unmarried and with-
out issue. In that year also Mrs. Goodrich, the daughter, died in the city of New York without issue from her marriage with Goodrich, leaving her husband surviving.
In the nearly eight years which supervened between the death of the father and the death of Mary, the daughter, the latter undoubtedly received from the executor of the estate of the father, by way of revenue or allowance, the provision made for her benefit by the will of the father. By the various deaths it came to pass that at the end of 1893 those entitled to the estate of Williams by the terms of the will, either for life or in remainder, were the surviving son, Thomas H. Williams, Jr.,
and the infant son of Mary, the daughter, represented by his father, Frank S. Johnson, who had, in 1889, in the proper probate court, been duly appointed the guardian of the estate of
such minor. After the death of Mrs. Goodrich her husband went from

214 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

New York to California for the purpose of the interment of the remains of his wife, and while being there a short time undoubtedly met the executor. Goodrich returned to New York, where he continued to reside. In 1896, three years after the return of Goodrich to New York, in the court having jurisdiction over the estate and person of the minor, the guardian Johnson applied for authority to agree with the executor of the estate of Williams on a final distribution of the estate. In making this application no reference was made to the fact of the marriage of Goodrich with the mother of the minor after her divorce. Conforming to the requirements of the California code of procedure, after hearing, the guardian was authorized to make the agreement for final distribution. Simultaneously or thereabouts the executor also filed in the proper probate court a petition asking the authority of the court to pass his accounts and make a final distribution of the estate. Express notice was given to Williams, the surviving son, and to Johnson, the guardian of the minor, and in accordance with the provisions of the California code a publication, by a posting of notice for a period of ten days, was ordered and duly made. On January 5, 1897, after hearing and in view of the consent of the parties, the accounts were finally passed and a full distribution of the estate was made between the parties in interest, that is, 40 per cent of the estate was transferred to the minor, Frank Hanson Johnson, through his guardian, 262 per cent to Thomas H. Williams, Jr., the son in fee, and 333 per cent was vested in Williams as trustee for the benefit during life of Thomas H. Williams, Jr.
Nearly three years after the entry of the decree of final distribution, in December, 1899, Williams, the trustee, died, and by proceedings in the Superior Court of the city and county of San Francisco, John W. Ferris was appointed trustee.
More than eighteen years after the death of Williams and the probate of his will, about eleven years from the date of the death of the daughter Mary, the wife of Goodrich, and more than seven years after the passing of the final account of the

executor and the final distribution of the estate by the probate court, viz., on May 19, 1904, the bill which is here in question was filed. Ferris, trustee, Williams, the surviving son of the deceased, and Johnson, as guardian, and his minor son were made defendants. The facts above recited in various forms of
statement were alleged, and, in substance, it was charged that the will and codicil of Williams, the deceased, were void because the absolute power of alienation of the property of the deceased, contrary to the laws of California against perpetuities, was by the terms of the will suspended for a period of three years, and not for a period measured by the continuance of lives in being, and therefore as to all property included in the trust which Williams, the deceased, attempted to create by his will he had died intestate, and all his property by reason thereof vested at his death in his heirs at law. It was averred that complainant, as heir of his deceased wife, was entitled to a stated share of her estate. It was charged that all the proceedings had in the probate court were fraudulent and subject to be avoided; that in those proceedings the fact of the remarriage of the daughter, Mary, and the survivorship of her husband, Goodrich, the complainant, had been sedulously concealed for the purpose of misleading the court; that when Goodrich was in California, after the death of his wife, he was notified, as the result of an inquiry made of the executor, that the death of his wife terminated her interest in the estate of her father; that the proceedings in the probate court concerning the final accounting and distribution were fraudulently had for the purpose of depriving the complainant of his interest in the estate, and it was expressly charged that in those proceedings the existence of the complainant and his interest in the estate were concealed. The whole proceedings, it was also averred, were not only subject to be avoided because of fraud, but to have been absolutely wanting in due process of law, because of the absence of express notice to the complainant, and because the provisions of the statutes of California providing for notice by ten days' posting were void, because insuffi-

cient as to a resident of the city of New York, and in consequence repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Without stating the various grounds upon which the defendants demurred, it suffices to say that the bill having been submitted to the court on the demurrers was, by it dismissed, as we have said, because the court was without jurisdiction in equity to set aside the probate of the will and to reopen upon the grounds alleged in the bill the probate proceeding had conformably to the local law.
It is manifest from the foregoing statement that the only possible ground upon which the assertion that we have jurisdiction by direct appeal to review the action of the trial court can rest is the contention made below that as to the complainant the notice of the hearing in the probate court upon the petition for the settlement of the account of the executor and for the final distribution' of the estate of Williams did not amount to due process of law. Farrellv. O'Brien, 199 U. S. 89, 100, and cases cited. It is equally certain as held in the cited case that the mere fact that a constitutional question is alleged does not suffice to give us jurisdiction to review by direct appeal, if such question is unsubstantial, and so devoid of merit as to be clearly frivolous.
The grounds for the contention that a constitutional question exists are thus stated in the brief of counsel for appellant:
"4. Sections 1633 and 1634 of the Civil Code of California, upon which jurisdiction of the court to make the consent decree of distribution is based, are in contravention of section 1, article VI, of the Constitution of the United States.
"The notice of final settlement and distribution posted for ten days in the city and county of San Francisco did not constitute due process of law as to appellant, who was and is a citizen and resident of the State of New York."
The sections of the California code above referred to are thus set forth in the bill:
"SEc. 1633. When any account is rendered for settlement, the clerk of the court must appoint a day for the settlement

214 U. S.

thereof and thereupon give notice thereof by causing notices to be posted in at least three public places in the county, setting forth the name of the estate, the executor or administrator, and the day appointed for the settlement of the account. If, upon the final hearing at the time of the settlement, the court, or a judge thereof, should deem the notice insufficient for any cause, he may order further notice to be given as maybe proper.
"SEC. 1634. If the account mentioned in the preceding section be for a final settlement, and a petition for the final distribution of the estate be filed with said account, the notice of settlement must state those facts, which notice must be given by posting or publication. On the settlement of said account, distribution and partition of the estate to all entitled thereto may be immediately had, without further notice or proceedings."
While various decisions of this court and of the courts of two States are cited in the brief of counsel for appellant under each of the foregoing propositions, none of them are apposite, and indeed, although citing them, counsel have specifically commented upon but one, viz., Roller v. Holly, 176 U. S. 398. That case, however, concerned the validity of original process by which the conceded property of a non-resident situate within the jurisdiction of the State of Texas was sought to be subjected to the control of its courts. The proposition which was presented for decision in that case was whether a statutory notice of five days given to a resident of Virginia, requiring him to appear in Texas and defend a suit brought against him to foreclose a vendor's lien upon his land, constituted reasonable and adequate notice for the purpose. Manifestly, that case is not in any particular analogous to the one under consideration, which is a case involving the devolution and administration of the estate of a decedent, a subject peculiarly within state control. Case of Broderick's Will, 21 Wall. 503, 519. It is elementary that probate proceeding by which jurisdiction of a probate court is asserted over the estate of a decedent for the purpose of administering the same is in the nature of a pro-

GOODRICH v. FERRIS.

Opinion of the Court.

ceeding in rem, and is therefore one as to which all the world is
charged with notice. And that the law of California conforms to this general and elementary rule is beyond question. Win. Hill Co. v. Lawler, 116 California, 359. The distribution of the estate of Williams was but an incident of the proceeding prescribed by the laws of California in respect to the administration of an estate in the custody of one of its probate courts. Under such circumstances, therefore, and putting aside the question of whether or not the State of California did or did not possess arbitrary power in respect to the character and length of notice to be given of the various steps in the administration of an estate in the custody of one of its courts, we hold that the claim that ten days' statutory notice of the time appointed for the settlement of the final account of the executor and for action upon the petition for final distribution of the Williams estate was so unreasonable as to be wanting in due
process of law, was clearly unsubstantial and devoid of merit, and furnished no support for the contention that rights under the Constitution of the United States had been violated. As held in Bellingham Bay Co. v. New Whatcom, 172 U. S. 314, 318, even although the power of a state legislature to prescribe length of notice is not absolute, yet it is certain "that only in a clear case will a notice authorized by the legislature be set aside as wholly ineffectual on account of the shortness of the time."
The jurisdiction to determine this appeal upon the merits being dependent upon the existence of a constitutional question in the record, and the mere averment that such a question was raised below not being sufficient where the alleged Federal question is so wanting in merit as to cause it to be frivolous or without any support whatever in reason, it follows that the appeal must be and it is

resori to that body for relief. It is a very great hardship to subject the carriers to possibly conflicting regulations and leave them uncertain which government may rightfully assert its controlling authority. So it was said in the McNeil case that the order there "asserted a power concerning a subject directly covered by the act of Congress to regulate commerce, and the amendments to that act, which forbid and provide remedies to prevent unjust discriminations and the subjecting to undue disadvantages by carriers engaged in interstate commerce." This statement was made as an additional reason for holding the state action invalid, and seems in conflict with the holding in this case.

I am authorized to state that MR. JUSTICE WHITE. joins in this opinion.

No. 50. Argued December 9, 10, 1908.-Decided January 11, 1909.
Although the estate may amount to more than $5,000, if the aggregate interest of plaintiffs in error is less than that amount, and the balance of the estate goes to defendants in error, the necessary amount in controversy does not exist to give this court jurisdiction of an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia setting aside a will.

Opinion of the Court.

211 U. S.

MR. JUSTICE McKENNA delivered the opinion of the court.

This writ of error brings up for review the judgment of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, confirming the judgment of the Probate Court, entered upon a verdict of a jury upon issues framed under a caveat filed against a paper writing alleged to be the last will and testament of Julia M. Adams. The will was presented for probate by Decatur Morgan, who was named therein as executor, and who, with his wife, Jennie G. Morgan, were the principal legatees therein. Defendants in error, who were respectively nephews and nieces of the deceased, filed a caveat against the probate of the will, alleging the incapacity of the deceased to make a will, and also alleging un-
due influence -and fraud and coercion exercised upon her by the Morgans and other persons. An answer was filed denying the
allegations of the caveat, and the following issues were framed for submission to the jury: (1) Was the written paper propounded as the last will and testament of the deceased executed in due form of law? (2) Was the testatrix, at the time of executing the will, of sound and disposing mind? (3) Was it procured by the undue influence of Decatur Morgan or Jennie G. Morgan, or other person or persons? (4) Was it procured by fraud or coercion of either of the Morgans, or other person or persons?
A jury was impannelled to try the issues, and the questions in the case turn upon certain instructions given by the court upon the second and third issues. The other two, that is, the first and fourth issues, were withdrawn by defendants in error. The verdict of the jury was adverse to the plaintiffs in error on the two issues submitted. Judgment was in due course entered, denying the probate of the will, which judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals. 29 App. D. C. 198.
A question is presented as to the right of plaintiffs in error to bring the case to this court. Defendants in error contend the amount in dispute is less than the necessary amountto confer juiisdiction. The total value of the estate is $7,394.50, only

MORGAN v. ADAMS.

211 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

$4,144.50 of which axe bequeathed to the Morgans, the balance of the estate goes to defendants in error, except $250.00 bequeathed to the Epiphany Church. The matter in dispute, it is hence contended, is nearly $1,009 less than the jurisdictional
amount. A similar question came up in Overby v. Gordon, 177 U. S.
214. The case was a contest of a will. The plaintiffs in error in this court offered its probate on the ground that the testator was a resident of Georgia when he made the will, not of the District of Columbia, and that his personal estate passed under the'lais
of Georgia to plaintiffs in error, who were next of kin of the testator. They were unsuccessful in the court below and then brought the case here, and a motion was made to dismiss, because the interests of plaintiffs in error were several and each interest less than five thousand dollars, and that, therefore, the matter in dispute was less than that sum and this court had no jurisdiction. The motion was denied, this court answering that the value of the estate was the matter in dispute. This, however, was put upon the ground that the question in the case was whether an estate valued at nine thousand dollars should pass, as provided in the alleged will, which, in effect, excluded the next of kin, or in the mode provided by the law of the domicil of the decedent for the transmission of an intestate estate. The purpose of the case therefore, was, it was said, not to seek an allotment to them of their interests, but an adjudication that the alleged will was invalid, and that that contention was advanced by virtue of a claim of common title in the ri.ext of kin of the decedent'in the corpus of the estate derived fron the alleged law of the domicil of the deceased. In other words, it was held in such case that where parties seek a recovery under the same title and for a common and undivided interest, the sum sought to be recovered, not the share of each individual claimant, constitutes the matter in dispute. And for this see Shields v. Thomas, 17 How. 3, and New Orleans & Pacific Railway v. Parker,143 U. S. 42, 51, 52.
The case at bar is distinctly different. The legacies -to the

plaintiffs in error, of course, depend upon the validity of the will. That constituted. their common title, but the sum of their interest is only $4,144.50, which is less than the amount necessary to give jurisdiction to this court, nor would the necessary amount be reached if the legacy to the Epiphany Church be added.

FITCHIE v. BROWN.

APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF THP HAWAII.

TERRITORY OF

No. 47. Argued October 29, 30, 1908.-Decided December 7, 1908.

Executors, parties to the action but who have not appealed, cannot be heard against a decree construing the will and determining the
validity of trusts on an appeal taken by other parties.
The common law having been made applicable by statute in Hawaii, and there being no other statute regulating the subject, trusts must be valid as at common law; and the utmost extent of a testamentary trust is limited by ascertained lives in being at the time of its creation, selected by the testator but not necessarily having an interest in the property, and for twenty-one years after the death of the last survivor which must be ascertainable by reasonable evidence.
The tedtator's intent is to be sought and carried out if not illegal; and although the persons whose lives are to limit a trust may not actually be so designated in the will it is sufficient if a class or number of lives are referred to so as to plainly indicate that they were selected for
that purpose. A testamentary trust to continue as long as possible "under the statute"
is not void, because in Hawaii there is no statute and the common

Statement of the Case.

211 U. S.

law is applicable; the testator's intent being evident that the trust was to continue as long as legally possible. The fact that the class limiting the duration of a common-law trust is large-in this case over forty-does not render it void if it is otherwise legal. A trust created for as long a period under the statute as possible he/d legal at common law and to be limited by the lives of annuitants mentioned in the will and evidently intended, although not so specified, by the testator as being the lives selected for the duration of the trust and twenty-one years after the death of the last survivor. Where there are a numler of annuitants constituting a class selected to determine the duration of a common-law trust, the fact that there is a corporation among them will not render the trust illegal, as creating a perpetuity; the annuity to the corporation will cease on the expiration of the trust twenty-one years after the death of the last surviving individual annuitant. In this case, surplus income, after paying specified annuities, should be accumulated until the termination of the trust and then distributed as part of the estate to those entitled thereto under the will. Whether or not a trustee named in a will can act as such does not affect the validity of the will; in case he cannot act the court can appoint a trustee to carry out the provisions of the trust. 18 Hawaii, 52, affirmed.
THE parties to this proceeding agreed upon a case, without
action, containing the facts upon which a controversy had arisen between them, and submitted the same to the Supreme Court of the Territory of Hawaii, conformably to the laws of
that Territory. The court heard the case and made a decree therein, from
which those named above as plaintiffs in the submission have appealed to this court, but the defendant executors have not
appealed.
From the agreed statement of facts contained in the submission it appears that one George Galbraith, who died at
Honolulu on the fifth of November, 1904, while domiciled in
the Territory of Hawaii, left a will, which has been duly admitted to probate in Hawaii, disposing of an estate of about
$121,000 in personal property and $128,000 in real estate in
Hawaii, and a small amount of real estate in Ireland.

FITCHIE v. BROWN.

211 U. S.

Statement of the Case.

The will gave some pecuniary legacies to a number of people, relatives and friends, and then provided that-
"The balance, residue or remainder of my estate is to be placed in trust for as long a period as is legally possible, the termination or ending of said trust to take place when the law requires it under the statute.
"I hereby nominate and appoint the Hawaiian Trust Company, Limited, of Honolulu, Territory of Hawaii, as trustee of the aforesaid balance, residue or remainder of my estate and they are to devote sufficient of the annual income derived from the same toward paying the following annuities, which are to be free and clear of all taxes, unto the following persons mentioned, namely," [here follow the names of the annuitants and the amounts which they arc to receive yearly].
"All of the foregoing for life, and then to their heirs, save and excepted the last three persons, namely, Josie Fink, Emma Douglass and Matilda Bailey, who are to receive only their life annuities and at their death all their interests to cease.
"On the final ending and distribution of the trust, the trust fund to be divided equally amongst those persons entitled at that time to the aforementioned annuities." .
On the same day the testator made a codicil, in which he made some changes of the annuities, substituting for the annuity given to the seven children of Hugh Galbraith, of $2,520 annually, an annuity to the same children of $2,100 yearly for life, and then to their heirs.
The testator also bequeathed by the codicil an annuity to
the Kona Orphanage of Kona of $100 yearly, "under the same conditions as the other annuitants mentioned, save and excepted, Hugh Galbraith, Josie Fink, Emma Douglass, and Matilda Bailey."
Upon the above facts several questions arose and were submitted to the court below, among them one which relates to the validity of the trust and another to the disposition of the surplus income remaining after the payments to the annuitants mentioned in the will.

Argument for Appellants.

211 U. S.

The Supreme Court of Hawaii ordered a decree to be entered, which declared that the will of George Galbraith established a valid trust, and that the Hawaiian Trust Company, Limited, a corporation, the trustee named in the will, was legally authorized to administer the trust; that under the trust it was the duty of the trustee to pay out of the income of the trust property the annuities payable by the provisions of the will to
the four persons named therein for their respective lives and for the payment of the other annuities payable by the will to the other annuitants 'therein named for and during their respective lives, and thereafter to pay the same to their heirs respectively until the end of twenty-one years after the death
of the last survivor of all the said annuitants, and during the same period of time to pay to the Kona Orphanage the annuity directed in the will, and at the end of said twenty-one years to divide the trust fund and its accumulated a-id unapplied income as required by the direction in that behalf contained in the will.

Mr. Aldis B. Broume, with whom Mr. W. L. Stanley, Mr. Henry Holmes and Mr. Alexander Britton were on the brief, for appellants:
The trust for final distribution- "on the final ending and distribution of the trust, the trust fund to be divided equally amongst those persons entitled at that time to the aforementioned annuities "-is invalid because there is no direction in the will as to when it iAto take place, to which effect can be given.
The words in question would not have the effect of fixing the time for the termination of the annuities and the payment over of the corpus at the end of twenty-one years after lives in being.
As to what is the effect of inserting such words, and the
absence of any general rule on the question, see Shelley v. Shelley, L. R. 6 Eq. 540; In re Johnston, L. R. 26 Ch. D. 538; Sackville-West v. Viscount Homesdale, L. R. 4 Eng. and I.

Graham, 33 Beav. 242.
Galbraith's will does not dispose of heirlooms; it does not contain any such referential trust, nor does it contain any executory trust, because if anything is clear as to the effect of the words in question, it is that they do not in themselves make the trust executory. 1 Perry on Trusts (2d ed.), par. 359; Harringtonv. Harrington,supra; Hill v. Hill, supra.
There is no ground for saying that the trust is executory, and therefore the court will mold the limitations; and it is only by ignoring the fact that the above are cases of referential trusts, executory trusts, or trusts in which the lives to be taken are pointed out by the testator, that they can be considered as having any bearing on the case before the court. All these cases are English. The policy of the law of Hawaii, where estates tail are illegal (12 Hawaii, 375), does not require this court actually to go beyond the cases decided in England where estates are entailed to support hereditary titles and
rights. But if the words in question could have the effect of fixing
the time for the termination of the annuities and the payment over of the corpus at the end of twenty-one years after lives in being, still the testator cannot be taken to have selected the lives in question, or any lives. There is no necessary presumption either by force of the common law or by the terms of the will, as compared with other wills which have been the subject of judicial decision, that the lives of the named annuitants, or any lives, were selected by the testator.

the "forty odd" annuitants are to measure the lives in being, would still make the trust void for reihoteness, because it will tend to a perpetuity, as the extinction of forty odd lives is more than can be made out by reasonable evidence or without difficulty. Thellusson v. Woodford, 4 Ves. 290; S. C., 11 Ves. 136; Gray, Rule against Perpetuities, § 218.

Mr. John C. Gray, with whom Mr. Roland Gray was on the brief, for the Hawaiian Trust Company, an appellee.
There is nothing illbgal in the grant of an annuity, and an annuity may be for years, for life or perpetual.
The invalidity of a gift over does not affect the validity of an annuity. The annuity twill continue up to the time fixed for the bad gift over, or else it will continue forever. But this is not material, as in this case the gift over is valid.
The whole intention of the testator must be considered together. He was not establishing two or more entirely separate funds. The testator states his two purposes in establishing the trust fund: the payment of annuities and the distribution of the principal of the fund. The trust is to continue as long
as it is legally possible, consistently with the accomplishment of these two purposes.
Further, the surplus income not being disposed of during
the payment of the annuities, the final gift -of the trust fund carries the accumulated surplus income. This is the intention which is presumed in the absence of indications to the contrary, and it is also actually in accord with all the indications in this will. On any other theory there would be an intestacy as to that phrt of the income. Such an accumulation is legally possible only when the gift of the accumulations becomes vested within the period allowed by the rule against perpetuities. Southampton v. Hertford, 2 V. & B. 54, 61; Boughton v. James, 1 Coll. 26, 45; Gray on Rule against Perpetuities, §§ 671, 674. The trust as an entirety, therefore, cannot continue beyond that period. But the testator cannot have intended that the payment of the annuities and the accumulation of the

FITCHIE v. BROWN.

211 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

surplus income should stop at different times. The gift over
of the trust fund is a single gift to take effect at one time, and it must have been intended to include the whole capital and accumulated income in a single distribution.
The trust for distribution is valid. The devise is not bad for uncertainty. The testator has sufficiently indicated what lives should be taken, and those lives were the lives of the persons to whom annuities were given for life. On this branch of the case see Poumall v. Graham, 33 Beav. 242; Shelley v. Shelley, L. R. 6 Eq. 540; Re Johnston, 26 Ch. Div. 538, 546; Gray on Rule against Perpetuities, §§ 363-367; Harringtonv. Harrington, L. R. 3 Ch. Div. 564; S. C., L.

If the trust for distribution is sustained, the surplus of income accruing before the time of distribution is to be accumulated. On this point see Genery v. Fitzgerald, Jac. 468; Re Dumble, 23 Ch. Div. 360, 365; Hurfordv. Haines, 67 Maryland, . 240; McKee's Appeal, 96 Pa. St. 277, 284; Cochrane v. Schell, 140 N. Y. 516, 537; Abbot v. Essex Co., 18 How. 202, 216; Given v. Hilton, 95 U.

Iants, who are the heirs of testator, insist, first, that the provision in the will for final distribution, ordering the trust fund to be divided equally among those persons entitled at that time to the annuities mentioned, is invalid, because there is no direction in the will as to when it is to take place, and therefore effect cannot be given to it; that the only direction in the will as to the duration of the trust is contained in the
words "the residue . . . to be placed in trust for as long a period as is legally possible, the termination or ending of said trust to take place when the law requires it under the statute." Unless there is contained in those words a direction as to the duration of the trust, or, in other words, a direction as to the period at which that part of the trust which consists of the payment of annuities is to cease, and that part which consists of the distribution of the capital is to take place, then, it is contended, the duration of the trust has not been sufficiently declared by the testator, and the trust is one which the court cannot carry out; second, that if the above words do constitute a direction as to the duration of the trust, yet still the testator has not selected the lives in being which are to be taken as a limitation of the trust; third, that even if the testator had selected the lives consisting of all the annuitants mentioned, they are more than forty in number, and the trust is void, because it would then tend to a perpetuity, as the extinction of more than forty lives is more than can be made but by reasonable evidence or without difficulty, it being quite impracticable to ascertain when the last of more than forty lives would be extinguished.
The counsel for the. executors pf the testator; appellees herein, was permitted in this coukt to file a brief and was heard orally on the argui,1ent before us, although no appeal from the decree had been taken by the executors, this court stating, however, that it woula thereafter decide whether counsel for executors had any right to be heard to contend against the decree of the court below.
Counsel, in fact, did argue against some parts of the decree,

FITCHIE v. BROWN.

211 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

contending that the trust was valid in so far as it provided for the payment of the annuities specified, but that the provision for final distribution was void, and that the annuities succeeding to and other than the life annuities were perpetual, and that there was an intestacy as to that not required to satisfy all the annuities.
We are of opinion that counsel for the executors had no right to appear and be heard against the decree, no appeal having been taken from it by his clients.
The trustee contends that the whole trust is valid, and that the surplus income over the amount necessary for the payment of the annuities mentioned must be accumulated up to the time of the general distribution under the trust, as provided for in the will, and that such surplus shall then be distributed as part of the trust fund to the persons then entitled to that fund.
Our first inquiry is, Was this trust valid as a whole? It is conceded by all that the common law is applicable, and that there is no statute in Hawaii governing the subject, except the statute making the common law applicable there, and that the utmost extent of a trust at common law is limited by lives in being at its creation and for twenty-one years thereafter; that the lives must be selected by the testator in his will; that they must be ascertained lives, i. e., lives that can be distinguished, and the fact of the death of the last survivor must be capable of being made out by reasonable evidence [Thellusson v. Woodford, 4 Ves. 227; S. C., 11 Ves. 134, 146; In re Moore (1901), 1 Ch. 936], and the selected lives need not be those having an interest in the property. Moore's Case is an example of a void limitation on the ground of uncertainty. The limitation was measured by twenty-one years from the death of the last survivor of all persons living at the death of the testatrix.
A perusal of the will shows that the testator did not in so many words name the persons whose lives the trustee contends he selected for the limitation of the trust.

OCTOBER TERM, 1908.

Opinion of the Court.

211 U. S.

However, if the scheme of the will, discoverable from its provisions, be such that a plain implication arises from those provisions that a certain class or number of lives mentioned, or referred to, in the will were selected by the testator for a limitation of the trust, such implied selection is sufficient.
It is the intention of the testator that is to be sought, and such intention is not always found to have been directly, and in so many words, expressed in the will. An intention, which is implied from language actually used and from facts actually
appearing in the will, is to be carried out, provided it does not violate the law. An intention so implied is as good as an intention more plainly and in direct terms expressed. The question is, therefore, whether the testator, by an implication arising from the language used in the will and the facts therein appearing, selected those lives by which the trust is to be limited.
Looking at the will, it is seen that a trust is created for three
purposes: The first, to pay certain annuitants out of the income of the fund; the second, to hold the fund until the time for distribution arrives; and the third,. to distribute it to those people who may then be entitled to it, as provided by the
terms of the will. The whole trust, the testator has provided, shall continue
as long as is legally possible, and it is not to be confined to any particular subdivision of the trust. The direction to hold and distribute is as imperative as the direction to pay annuitants until distribution is made. When the testator created the trust in the language already quoted he must have intended it should be measured .by .some lives then in 'being, and for not more than twenty-one years thereafter, because that is the longest time a trust of that kind is-legally possible, aid he provided it should last as long as that. There are no other lives that can reasonably be said to have been within th intention - of the testator when he was making this provigion. It is said that being ignorant of the legal length of time a trust could last, he therefore provided that it should

FITCHIE v. BROWN.

211 U. S.

Opiion of the Court.

last as long as legally possible, and thus ,he could not have had an intention to select any particular life or lives in limit-
ing the length of the trust. There is force in the argument, but we are disposed to think
that the position taken by the trustee is the correct one, and, indeed, is the only one compatible with the intention of the testator, to be gathered from the will. That intention could not have been to create annuities to last forever, as is contended, because it is plain from the provisions of the will that the testator intended to have the gift over of the whole estate created by the will divided at some future time among those who would be entitled to it at the time of such distribution. A perpetual annuity would prevent some part of the gift over from taking effect. There is not only the provision for con-
tinuing the trust as long as is legally possible, but there is also a provision, as part of the trust, for holding the fund and distributing it according to the terms of the will. Distribution, therefore, is certainly part of the scheme of the will, and distribution of all of the fund created by the trust-not a part of it. This distribution could not take place if the payment of the annuitips provided for in the will were to continue forever.
As he was making provision for' the annuitants mentioned
in the will and for the payrment to the heirs of such of those annuitants as died, it seems plain that the trust for the payment of the annuities should continue no longer than up to the time provided in fhe will for the distribution of the whole estate, and that distribution we think the testator intended to be twenty-one years after the death of the last survivor of the annuitants named in the will, for that period was aS long as the trust could last under the terms of the will.
Upon all these considerations the inference, we think, is very strong that the lives selected were the lives of the annuitants. A reading of the will fails to suggest any other set of lives that the testator could reasonably be supposed to have intended. ' The inference that he intended these lives is almost conclusive. That he intended to dispose of his whole estate,

OCTOBER TERM, 1908.

Opinion of the Court.

211 U. S.

and not to die intestate as to any part of it, is plain from the language of the will. Either these lives must be regarded as intended by the testator or there is an intestacy as to a considerable part of the estate. The testator certainly did not mean that, and there is in addition a strong presumption against it. Counsel for the heirs do not argue that testator did not intend to make testamentary disposition of his whole estate, but that the disposition which they contend he did make was invalid. The -answer to the question of what disposition he did make is easier to be given when aided by the presumption that he intended a valid rather than invalid disposition, there being from the language of the will one construction of his intention that would make the will valid, although there might be another possible, and at the same time unlikely,- construction that would render it invalid. This selection prevents the trust from being bad for uncertainty or remoteness.
The whole of the language of the will must be considered,
and while it says the trust is to continue as long as it is legally possible, it must also be remembered that a distribution of the whole estate is to be made, and therefore the continuation of the trust must also be limited by the direction to distribute; or, in other words, the trust is to continue as long as is legally possible and as shall be consistent with making the distribution as directed by the will. This distribution must be made at a time which is not too remote, that is, a time within which the trust would be valid, for the testator provided that the trust should only last that long. Payments of the most of the annuities are to be continued to the heira of the annuitants, but we think these payments are to stop with the death of the last survivor of the annuitants named in the list and twenty-one years thereafter. The distribution of the entire corpus of the fund remaining with the trustee is then to be made as provided for in the will.
The use of the words "under the statute" in the will, providing for the termination of the trust when the law requires

FITCHIE v. BROWN.

211 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

it under the statute, is not material. It must be assumed that the testator was not positive as to the time provided by law for the duration of a trust, or whether it was limited by any particular statute. It is enough to know that his desire was to have the trust continue as long as was legally possible, and consistent with distribution as directed, and that the estate was to be then distributed, and hence the trust to pay the annuities was to cease when it would no longer be consistent with the provision for distribution. As the testator has mentioned annuitants to whom payments are to be made, it is most reasonable to infer from that fact that their lives and the -life of the survivor of them were the lives he had in view, and therefore they are to be regarded as selected by him. The fact that in the meantime, when an annuitant died, payment was to be made to his heirs, does not affect the limitation to the survivor of the- annuitants. His death then terminates the class, and twenty-one years from that time distribution is to be made.
As the question whether a valid trust has been created depends upon the construction to be given to the language of this particular will, reported cases in regard to the language used in other wills (unless similar -to this in their facts) are not of great benefit in the solution of the question as to the intention of the testator in the will before us. The case of Poumall v. Graham, 33 Beav. 242 (Gray on Rule against Perpetuities, § 219), seems, however, to be as nearly in point as any to be found. There the question was as to what lives were to be taken as measuring the limitation of the trust, as none had been directly selected in so many words by the testator, but it was thought, upon looking over the entire will, that the testator intended a certain class of lives mentioned in it as the limitation of the, trust, and the court accordingly so decided. Counsel for the heirs have criticised the application of that case, but we think unsuccessfully.
Some light is also to be found in' a certain class of English cases, known as the Heirloom Cases, where bequests of per-

OCTOBER TERM, 1908...

211 U. S.

sonal property were made to go as heirlooms along with certain real property, "as far as the rules of law and equity will permit." These cases are to be found in Gray on Rule against Perpetuities, notes to §§ 363-367. They are cited for the purpose of showing that a limitation in a gift, "as far as the rules of law and equity will permit," is not bad for uncertainty, and that the period of limitation to be taken is to be determined from a consideration of the whole will. They strengthen the proposition that it is not necessary to find in the will, in so many words, the selection of lives, but that such selection is good if from a consideration of the whole will that selection can be ascertained.
Counsel for the heirs contend that there is as much reason for including the Kona' Orphanage among the lives of the annuitants as a limitation of the trust as there is to say that the limitation includes only the individual annuitants. The orphanage is a corporation or joint stock company, and could not be included in or constitute a life in being within the rule
of which we are speaking. To include it would render the trust void, and the testator intended a valid trust.
We see no reason for holding that the number of annuitants, which it is said exceeds forty, is too large for a valid limitation of the trust. There are cases cited from the English reports showing that even a larger number than that has been held not to exceed a-valid limitation, and in Humberston v. Humberston, 1 P. Wims. 332, which is cited in Thelluson v. Woodford, 11 Ves. 112, 135, it would seem there were about fifty life- estates.
We therefore sustain the validity of the trust in this case, and the question remaining is as to the disposition of the surplus income arising during the payment of the annuities. The will shows that the testator supposed there Would be such surplus. Should it be accumulated or paid to the heirs of testator? We think the surplus, after paying annuities, must accumulate as part of the trust estate until the time arrives for the distribution of that estate, and that such accumulation

INGERSOLL v. CORAM.

211 U. S.

Syllabus.

must then be distributed as a part thereof to those who will then have the right to take the estate as provided for in the will. The accumulation is to be treated as a surplus arising from both real and personal estate, and the person or persons entitled to receive the main fund are to take the surplus as
if it arose entirely from personalty. Some of the cases upon this subject are gathered in the brief of counsel for the-trustee and it is not necessary to cite them here. Holding the trust to be valid, it is not now necessary to determine to whom the distribution is to be made when the time for distribution shall arrive.
The trust company is entitled to take the property and execute the trust. We do not understand that this is now controverted by -counsel for any of the parties. In any event, it does not affect the validity of the trust. If the trustee named could not act the court would appoint a trustee to carry out the provisions of the trust. Vidal v.
