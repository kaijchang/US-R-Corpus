BAKER, INDIVIDUALLY AND AS ADMINISTRATRIX OF BAKER, v. BAKER, ECCLES & COMPANY ET AL.
ERROR TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF KENTUCKY.
No. 115. Argued December 19, 1916.-Decided January 8, 1917.
The rule that the personal estate of an intestate has its situs at his domicile, and is subject to be administered and distributed according to the domiciliary laws, is merely a rule of the common law, which the States may adopt, modify or reject, as their policies dictate.
Each State has the power to control and administer the personal assets qf an intestate found within her borders, such as debts due from a local corporation or the shares of its stock, to satisfy the rights of her own citizens in the distribution of such assets.
No State, therefore, has the power, by probate or other proceedings in rem, to fix the status as to .administration, pnd determine the course of devolution, of personal property of an intestate situate beyond her borders and within the domain of another State.
Under the Fourteenth Amendment, the courts of one State are without power to determine by an action in personam the domicile of a decedent or the devolution of his personal assets situate in another State, as against persons, residents of the latter, who do not appear in the proceedings and are notified by publication only.
The full faith and credit clause of the Constitution and the act of Congress passed pursuant to it do not entitle a judgment in personam

to extra-territorial effect, if it be shown that it was rendered without
jurisdiction over the person sought to be bound. 162 Kentucky, 683, affirmed.

THE case is stated in the opinion.

Mr. John A. Pitts, with whom Mr. E. W. Ross was on the briefs, for plaintiff in error.

Mr. Charles K. Wheeler, with whom Mr. Daniel Henry Hughes and Mr. James Guthrie Wheeler were on the briefs, for defendants in error.

MR. JUSTICE PITNEY delivered the opinion of the court.

The federal question presented in this record is whether the Court of Appeals of Kentucky gave such faith and credit to certain judicial proceedings of the State of Tennessee as were required by Article IV, § 1, of the Constitution, and the act of Congress passed in pursuance thereof. Act of May 26, 1790, c. 11, 1 Stat. 122; Rev. Stats., § 905.
The facts are as follows: Charles Baker died in Septem-
ber, 1912, the owner of certain real and personal property in Hardin County, Tennessee, and of 270 shares of stock of Baker, Eccles & Company, a Kentucky corporation, of the par value of $27,000, and a claim of several thousand dollars against that corporation for surplus profits. He left a widow, Josie C. Baker, now plaintiff in error, and a mother, Augusta H. Baker, one of the defendants in error. He appears to have left no children or descendants, nor any considerable indebtedness, and the personal estate, if distributable according to the laws of Tennessee, would go entirely to the widow; if distributable according to the laws of Kentucky, it would go one-half to the widow, the other half to the mother. The place of his domicile, admittedly determinative of the, law of distribution, was in controversy.

OCTOBER TERM, 1916.

Opinion of the Court.

242 U. S.

Shortly after his death the widow applied to the County Court of Hardin County, Tennessee, for letters of administration. The proceedings were ex parte, and her application was granted, the order of the court appointing her administratrix reciting that at the time of his death the residence of Charles Baker was in that county. Afterwards, and in December, 1912, the widow presented to the same court a settlement of her accounts as administratrix, and an order was made reciting that it appeared from proof that Charles Baker died intestate, and at the time of his death was a resident of Hardin County, Tennessee, and that he left no children or descendants of such surviving, but left surviving his widow, the said Josie C. Baker, and under the laws of Tennessee she, as widow, was entitled to all of the surplus personal property; whereupon it was ordered that she as administratrix transfer and deliver to herself as the widow of the deceased all of the personal estate in her possession, including the stock in the Kentucky corporation, the certificates for which she held. Subsequently, and on December 28, 1912, the widow individually and as administratrix filed in the Chancery Court of Hardin County, Tennessee, her bill of complaint against Mrs. Augusta H. Baker, the mother, as a non-resident of Tennessee and a resident of the State of Kentucky, and also against several persons who were residents of Tennessee, setting up her appointment as administratrix, averring that her husband died intestate a resident of and domiciled in Tennessee, leaving his widow as his sole heir and distributee, and his mother and a brother his only heirs at law. The bill further set up the widow's ownership of the stock in Baker, Eccles & Company, and averred that the mother was asserting an interest in one-half of the personal estate left by the in-
testate, upon the theory that he died a resident of Kentucky and that under the laws of that State the mother was entitled to one-half of his surplus personal estate,

BAKER v. BAKER, ECCLES & COMPANY. 397

242 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

The prayer was (inter alia) that the mother be brought before the court in the manner provided for non-residents and be required to assert whatever claim she might have to the estate left by the deceased; and that it might be adjudged that Charles Baker died a resident of Tennessee, and that complainant as his widow was the sole distributee and entitled to all of his personal estate. Upon the filing of the bill an order of publication was made citing Augusta H. Baker as a non-resident to make defense upon a day named, and, she having failed to appear, the bill was taken for confessed against her, and eventually a decree was made "that the said Charles Baker at the time of his death was a citizen of and had his domicile at Savannah, Tennessee, and that the complainant as his widow is his sole distributee, and as such entitled to all of the personal estate of the said Charles Baker, after payment of such debts as were owed by him at the time of his death," and also that the title to the stock of Baker, Eccles & Company was in complainant, and that she was entitled to have a new certificate or certificates in her own name issued by the corporation in lieu of the certificates issued to said Charles Baker, and was entitled to receive from the corporation the amount of the accumulated profits and surplus and other amounts due from it to the decedent.
Meanwhile, the County Court of McCracken County, Kentucky, had granted letters of administration to Mrs. Augusta H. Baker, the mother, and she as such administratrix filed a petition in the McCracken Circuit Court for a settlement of the estate, making the widow and Baker, Eccles & Company defendants. The widow did not appear, and a judgment was rendered that Charles Baker died a resident of McCracken County, Kentucky, and that under the law of that State the mother and the widow were each entitled to one-half of the surplus of the personal estate. The corporation was directed to cancel the 270 shares of stock issued to decedent and reissue

one-half of these to the widow, the other half to the mother. This judgment has only historical importance, since the Kentucky Court of Appeals in the present case held it invalid as against the widow because of failure to comply with the local law respecting notice to her.
In June, 1913, the widow, individually and as administratrix of Charles Baker, began a suit in equity in the McCracken Circuit Court, which resulted in the judgment now under review. Baker, Eccles & Company was made defendant. The widow's petition, after setting up the orders and judgments of the Tennessee courts and alleging her sole ownership of the personal estate of the deceased .byvirtue thereof, prayed that the corporation be required to transfer to her individually the 270 shares of stock adjudged to her by the Tennessee chancery decree, and also prayed judgment for $11,429.17, the alleged indebtedness due from the corporation to her husband at the time of his death. Baker, Eccles & Company filed an answer putting in issue all the averments of the petition. Mrs. Augusta H. Baker, the mother, came' into the suit by an intervening petition, in which she averred that Charles Baker died a resident of the State of Kentucky, and that under the laws of that State she was entitled to one-half of the shares of stock and of the debt sued for, invoking the McCracken Circuit Court judgment as an adjudication to that effect.. She further put in issue the validity of the orders and judgments in both the Tennessee courts, averring that so far as they determined that Charles Baker died a resident of that State and that his widow was entitled to the whole of his personalty after payment of his debts, they were void, because neither of the Tennessee courts had jurisdiction to make such orders or-judgments. The pleadings having been made up, evidence was taken on .the issue of fact as to the domicile of Charles Baker at the time of his death. Upon this evidence, the records of the judicial proceedings above mentioned, and a show-

13AKER v. BAKER, ECCLES & COMPANY. 399

Opinion of the Court.

ing of the pertinent Tennessee law, the case was submitted for hearing, and it was adjudged that the widow's petition be dismissed. The widow appealed to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, and that court, having determined the judgment of the McCracken Circuit Court in the mother's administration suit to be invalid as against the widow, held that the judgments of both Tennessee courts were invalid as against the mother because entered without process of law as against her; and then, passing upon the question of fact as to the domicile of Charles Baker; found upon the evidence that he was domiciled in the State of Kentucky and his personalty was distributable according to the laws of that State, and affirmed the judgment, with a modification directing the lower court to enter a judgment that Charles Baker died a resident of Kentucky, that his mother and his widow were each entitled to one-half of his personal estate situate in Kentucky at the time of his death after the payment of his debts, that Baker, Eccles & Company should cancel all certificates of stock issued to Charles Baker, and reissue onehalf of these to the widow and the other half to the mother, and that the lower court embody in the judgment such other matters as would, after the payment of debts, distribute equally between the widow and the mother all other personal estate situate in Kentucky of which Charles Baker died possessed. 162 Kentucky, 683. To review this judgment upon the federal question, the widow brings the case here upon writ of error.
No question is made by defendants in error but that the Tennessee courts had general jurisdiction over the subjectmatter, nor that the proceedings were in conformity with the Tennessee statutes respecting practice. The sole question is whether they were entitled uader the Constitution of the United States and the act of Congress to recognition in the ourts of Kentucky as adjudicating adversely the mother's asserted right to share as distributee in the

personal property situate in Kentucky, or as conclusively determining the fact of the domicile of the decedent as affecting that right, in view of the failure of the Tennessee courts to acquire jurisdiction over her person or over the corporation, Baker, Eccles & Company.
It is the fundamental contention of plaintiff in error that the personal estate of an intestate decedent is a legal unit, having its situs at the owner's domicile, that the title to the whole of it, wherever situate, is vested in the duly qualified domiciliary administrator, and not in the distributees, and that its distribution is governed by the law of the domicile of the deceased owner. Wilkin& v. Ellett, 9 Wall. 740; 108 U. S. 256. Conceding that such is the general rule of law, it is so not because of any provision of the Federal Constitution, but only because the several States, or most of them, have adopted it from the common law into their respective systems. And the question remains, How is the fact of decedent's domicile to be judicially ascertained as a step in determining what law is to govern the distribution? Obviously, if fundamental principles of justice are to be observed, the ascertainment must be according to due process of law, that is, either by a proceeding in rem in a court having control of the estate, or by a proceeding in personam after service of process upon the parties to be affected by the judgment.
We have no concern with the effect of the Tennessee judgments upon the distribution of so much of decedent's personalty as was situate within that State. The present action affects only the ownership of shares of stock in a Kentucky corporation having no situs outside of its own State so far as appears, and a claim of indebtedness against the same corporation. For the purpose of founding administration, it is commonly held that simple contract debts are assets at the domicile of the debtor, even where a bill of exchange or promissory note has been given as evidence. Wyman v. Halstead, 109 U. S. 654, 656. The

242 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

State of the debtor's domicile may impose a succession tax. Blackstone v. Miller, 188 U. S. 189, 205. It is equally clear that the State which has created a corporation has such control over the transfer of its shares of stock that it may administer upon the shares of a deceased owner and tax the succession. See Matter of Bronson, 150 N. Y. 1, 9; Matter of Fitch, 160 N. Y. 87, 90; Greves v. Shaw, 173 Massachusetts, 205, 208; Kingsbury v. Chapin, 196 Massachusetts, 533, 535; Dixon v. Russell, 79 N. J. L. 490, 492; Hopper v. Edwards, 88 N. J. L. 471; People v. Griffith, 245 Illinois, 532. The rule generally adopted throughout the States is that an administrator appointed in one State has no power virtute officii over property in another. No State need allow property of a decedent to be taken without its borders until debts due to its own citizens have been satisfied; and there is nothing in the Constitution of the United States aside from the full faith and credit clause to prevent a State from giving a like protection to its own citizens or residents who are interested in the surplus after payments of debts. All of which goes to show, what plaintiff in error in effect acknowledged when she brought her present action in a Kentucky court, that the Tennessee judgments had no effect in rem upon the Kentucky assets now in controversy. She invokes the aid of those judgments as judgments in personam. But it is now too well settled to be open to further dispute that the "full faith and credit" clause and the act of Congress passed pursuant to it do not entitle a judgment in personam to extra-territorial effect if it be made to appear that it was rendered without jurisdiction over the person sought to be bound.
This rule beca. _e established long before the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, as the result of applying fundamental principles of justice and the rules of international law as they existed among the States at the inception of the Government. Notwithstanding that Mills v.

Duryee (1813), 7 Cranch, 481, 484,-where) as the opinion shows, the defendant had full notice of thQ suit, was arrested, and gave bail,-was by some courts interpreted as holding that irrespective of such notice the act of Congress required a judgment under all circumstances to receive the same faith and credit in every other State as it had in the State of its origin (Field v. Gibbs [1815], Pet. C. C. 155, 158; Fed. Cas. No. 4766, 9 Fed. Cas. 15, 16; Commonwealth v. Green [1822], 17 Massachusetts, 515, 546), the view soon came to prevail in the state courts that the case was not authority for so broad a proposition, and that whenever a judgment of a state court was produced as evidence, the jurisdiction of the court rendering it 1.ras open to inquiry, and if it appeared that the court had no jurisdiction the judgment was entitled to no faith or credit.1
Mr. Justice Story, who wrote the opinion in Mills v. Duryee, in his treatise on the Conflict of the Laws, published in 1834 (§ 609), declared that, the "full faith and credit" clause and the act of Congress did not prevent an inquiry into the jurisdiction of the court to pronounce the judgment, and this view was adopted and made the basis of decision by this court in D'Arcy v. Ketchum (1850), 11 Hgw. 165, which was followed by Thompson v. Whitman, 18 Wall. 457, 459, with a review of many cases.

Opinion of the Court.

intimated, if not held, by some of the state courts, that a personal judgment effective within the territory of the State could be rendered against a non-resident defendant who did not appear and submit himself to the jurisdiction, provided notice of the suit had been served upon him iri the State of his residence, or had been published in the State within which the court was situate, pursuant to the provisions of a local statute. See Smith v. Colloty, 69 N. J. L. 365, 371. As was said by Mr. Justice Field, speaking for this court in Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U. S.714, 732, it is difficult to see how such a judgment could legitimately have force even within the State. But until the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment (1868) this remained a question of state law; the effect of the "due process" clause of that Amendment being, as was held in the case just mentioned, to establish it as the law for all the States that a judgment rendered against a non-resident who had neither been served with process nor appeared in the suit was devoid of validity within as well as without the territory of the State whose court had rendered it, and to make the assertion of its invalidity a matter of federal right.
The fundamental requisite of due process of law in
judicial proceedings is the opportunity to be heard. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Schmidt, 177 U. S.230, 236; Simon v. Craft, 182 U. S. 427, 436; Grannis v. Ordean, 234 U. S.385, 394. To hold one bound by the judgment who has not had such opportunity is contrary to the first principles of justice. And to assume that a party resident beyond the confines of a State is required to come within its borders and submit his personal controversy to its tribunals upon receiving notice of the suit at the place of his residence is a futile attempt to extend the authority
and control of a State beyond its own territory. .So far as the case for plaintiff in error depends upon the
adjudication of domicile by the County Court of Hardin County, Tennessee, for the mere purpose of appointing

an adminiStratrix, it is controlled by Thormann v. Frame, .176 U. S. 350, and Overby v. Gordon, 177 U. S. 214, 227. But, it is pointed out, in this case the county court went beyond the bare appointment of an administratrix, and proceeded to a settlement and distribution of the estate. Moreover, plaintiff in error relies not merely upon this judgment, but upon the decree in the chancery court of the same county, which in form specifically determined her exclusive right to the Kentucky personalty. It results, however, from what we have already said that this right could not be conclusively established by any Tennessee court as against a resident of Kentucky who was not served with process and did not appear therein, and that the Kentucky courts did not go counter to the Federal Constitution and the act of Congress in refusing to give faith and credit to the Tennessee judgments.
In many forms, and with much emphasis, the plaintiff in error presses the argument ab inconvenienti. Starting from the proposition that the entire personalty of an intestate decedent wherever in fact located is a unit, having its legal situs at the bwner's domicile, and that its distribution ought to be in accordance with the law of that domicile, it is argued: How is it possible to judicially determine that domicile under the theory of the Kentucky Court of Appeals in the case of an intestate entitled to personalty in several States having different laws of distribution, and with parties claiming to be distributees residing in different jurisdictions? Assuming a lawful grant of administration in each State wherein part of the personalty is located and some of the possible distributees reside, how, it is asked, is any one of these administrators, or any one of the claimants of a share in the whole estate, to have the place of the intestate's domicile settled authoritatively and the lawful distributees ascertained? The answer is clear: Unless all possible distributees can be brought within the jurisdiction of a single court having authority

to pass upon the subject-matter, either by service of process or by their voluntary appearance, it must in many cases be impossible to have a single controlling decision upon the question. In some cases, the ideal distribution of the entire personal estate as a unit may thus be interfered with; but whatever inconvenience may result is a necessary incident of the operation of the fundamental rule that a court of justice may not determine the personal rights of parties without giving them an opportunity to be heard.

ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF OHIO.
No. 232. Argued December 4, 1916.-Decided January 8, 1917.
A city ordinance fixing the maximum rate chargeable by a gas company will not be adjudged confiscatory if at the time of the judicial inquiry the net profits derivable under the ordinance will give a fair return upon the then value of the company's property.
Plaintiff, a gas distributing company, whose rates were fixed by an ordinance, purchased its gas under a contract, which measured the vendor's compensation by a percentage of plaintiff's gross receipts. The contract antedated the ordinance and had several years to run .when suit was commenced. Plaintiff contended that under the ordinance rate the contract was no longer profitable to its vendor. Held, that the effect of the ordinance upon the constitutional rights of the vendor.was immaterial to plaintiff's case..
The contract expired before the evidence ,was closed. Held, that, for the purposes of this case, plaintiff not having shown what it paid afterwards, the contract might be assumed to measure plaintiff's probable expense for gas during the life of the ordinance.

IN EQUITY.
No. 20, Original. Motion to dismiss. Submitted January 8, 1917.-Decided March 6, 1917.
The State of New Mexico filed its bill in this-court naming the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of the General Land Office as the parties defendant and praying that a tract of land, which the Interior Department had awarded and sold as coal land to an entryman under the coal land law, be decreed the property of the State by virtue of the school-land grant to the Territory of New Mexico, and the State's succession thereto; that the entry proceedings be decreed unlawful and that issuance of patent thereon be enjoined. Questions concerning the construction of the laws mentioned, and questions of fact concerning the character of the land and the knowledge of it, were involved.
Held, that the suit must be dismissed as, in substance, a suit, against the United States. Louisianav. Garfield,211 U. S. 70.
Semble, that the presence of the entryman as a party, he having purchased the land and paid the price, would be indispensable to the granting of the relief prayed.

243 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

THE case is stated iDthe opinion.

The Attorney General, The Solicitor General and Mr. S. W. Williams for defendants, in support of the motion.

Mr. Harvey M. Friend for complainant, in opposition to the motion.

MR. JUSTICE MCKENNA delivered the opinion of the court.

Bill for injunction, in which the State of New Mexico asserts title in fee simple to the S. W. Y of the N. E. 4 of section 16, township 15 N., R. 18 W., New Mexico principal meridian, under the school-land grant of June 21, 1898, and prdys to restrain the Interior Department from issuing a patent therefor to one Keepers.
The bill exhibits the grounds of suit as follows: By § 1 of an act approved June 21, 1898, 30 Stat. 484, there were granted to the Territory of New Mexico sections 16 and 36 in every township in the State for the support of common schools. If such sections should be mineral, other lands were to be granted in lieu thereof, to be selected as provided in other sections of the act.
Section 6 of an act approved June 20, 1910, 36 Stat. 557, 561, which was an act to enable the people of New Mexico to form a constitution and state government and be admitted into the Union, granted, in addition to sections 16 and 36, sections 2 and 32 in every township in the proposed State not otherwise appropriated at the date of the passage of the act. This grant also was for the support of the common schools.
It was provided in § 10 that such lands and those theretofore granted were "expressly transferred and confirmed to the said State," and should "be by the said State held in trust," etc.
By § 12, except as modified or repealed by the act, all

grants of lands were ratified and confirmed to the State, subject to the provisions of the act.
On January 6, 1912, New, Mexico was admitted to the Union on an equal footing with the other States and became and is the beneficiary of the school-land grant of June 21, 11898. Such grant had been held a grant in prmsenti under which absolute title in fee to all sections '16 and 36 in' the Territory which were at that date identified passed tG the Territory at the date of the approval of the act, unless known to be mineral, and no certificate or patent was necessary to pass such title.
Township 15 N. of R. 18 W. was surveyed by the United States Government in 1881. The survey was approved by the Surveyor General of New Mexico November 30, 1881, and a township plat duly filed in the local land office and the land became subject to disposal
Jitly 21, 1882, which was many years prior to the grant of June 21, 1898.
Section 16 was not disposed of or otherwise reserved and therefore passed to the Territory by the grant of June 21, 1898, and the land described above was not at that time known to be mineral in character and was not then known coal land under the interpretation of the coal land law which had uniformly prevailed, in that at such date there had been no attempt on the part of any one to discover or develop coal upon it and no coal had been produced or
extracted therefrom until 1911, 13 years after the title in fee had vested in the Territory.
The decision of the Department and of the Supreme Court (this court) was that land could not be held to be "known coal land" unless there had been a mine opened thereon and an actual production of coal in such quantity as to make the land more valuable on that account than for other purposes, and that such construction had become a rule of property and title vested under it could not be divested by a change of construction.

NEW MEXICO v. LANE.

243 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

The construction was known to Congress when it passed the Act of June 21, 1898, Was adopted by it when it enacted that act, and became the rule of construction for the future administration of the land, and the acceptance of the grant became an executed contract between the Territory and the United States to be construed and interpreted as then understood. Notwithstanding, the Commissioner of the General Lahd Office and the Secretary of the Interior have decided that a locator on the land whose claim was filed in 1911 is entitled to have a patent for the tract above described and they are about to issue a patent to him.
On May 12, 1911, one George A. Keepers filed in the local land office at Sante Fe, New Mexico, a coal declaratory statement under § 2348, Rev. Stats., for the land in controversy, and three days thereafter he applied to purchase the same as coal land under § 2347, Rev. Stats., and publication of notice thereof as provided'by the mining laws and regulations of the Interior Department was. duly had, beginning May 19, 1911, and ending June 16, 1911.
Within the period of publication protests were filed against the application, and the Territory of New Mexico intervened, claiming the land 'under the Act of June 21, 1898, on the ground that it was not coal land at the date of the grant. A hearing was allowed to determine the land's character.
It is conceded that the Commissioner of the General Land Office had the right and authority to determine
the question whether the land was known coal land at the date of the grant of June 21, 1898. Nevertheless in such determination that official was restricted to ascertaining the single fact whether at the date of the grant a mine had been opened on the land or coal produced therefrom, and this was the sole question that he could investigate. But, notwithstanding, he undertook and directed a

58

OCTOBER TERM, 1916.

Opinion of the Court.

243 U. S.

hearing "to determine their true character" at the date of the hearing, which was in excess of his authority.
At the hearing by the local land office, testimony was taken largely addressed to the geological condition of the land and no testimony was adduced showing that any coal had ever been produced or extracted from the land prior to the date of the Act of June 21, 1898, or for many years thereafter and up until 1911. Nevertheless it was decided, upon developments made subsequently to that date and on other matters subsequently occurring, including the subsequent classification of the land as coal land by the Geological Survey in 1907, that the land contained coal at the date of the act and was for that reason known coal land at that date.
Upon appeal the ruling of the local officers was affirmed by the Commissioner and subsequently by the First Assistant Secretary of the Interior. There was no finding in his decision that the land was of known coal character
at the date of the granting act and the only fact relied. upon was that certain "disclosures" now, not then, indicated that the Black Diamond coal bed underlay a portion of the tract, which even if known would not under the law as then construed and interpreted have rendered the land known coal land. The decision, therefore, was purely arbitrary.
The State duly filed a motion for re-hearing, which was
denied, and the decision promulgated and the local officers directed to issue a final certificate to Keepers.
The bill avers "that when said final certificate shall be issued, as it undoubtedly has been, and upon its receipt at the General Land Office, the officials thereof, following the regulations of the Interior Department in such cases made and provided, will -at once proceed to issue a patent to said Keepers for said S. W. Y4 of the N. E. Y4 of said section 16, unless restrained by this honorable court in the meantime, which said tract is owned by and belongs

to your orator as a part of its school-land grant which was vested immediately in fee in the Territory of New Mexico, at the date of said school-land grant of June 21, 1898, to which right and title your orator has succeeded, as aforesaid, and such patent, if issued to said Keepers, will be a cloud upon the title of your orator to said tract, being an attempt, unlawfully, to deprive your orator of its title in fee simple thereto."
It is prayed that the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of the General Land Office be subpcenaed to appear and answer the bill, but not under oath; that it be decreed that the title immediately vested in the Territory of New Mexico at the date of the Act of June 21, 1898, and has become vested in the State as the successor of the Territory; that the Secretary and Commissioner have not had since the date oifthe act or now have authority to interfere with the State's title and that they
be enjoined from executing their orders and decision. General relief is also prayed.
A motion to dismiss the bill is made on the grounds: (1) The United States is a necessary party because it appears the title to the land involved is in the United States, and that it is the purpose of the defendants to dispose of the land in accordance with the provisions of the mineral land laws of the United States, and that if the defendants be enjoined from executing such purpose the United States would be deprived of the purchase price of the land. (2) It appears from the bill that the
State has no title or interest in the land because it was known coal land at the date of the passage of the Act of June 21, 1898, and was not 'intended to be granted nor granted to the Territory of New Mexico by that act nor any subsequent act. (3) That complete inquiry was made by the officers of the Land Department and they found the fact to be that at the date of the act the land was known to be valuable for mineral purposes. -(4) It

appears that one. Keepers had purchased the land and

therefore was an indispensable party. (5) The bill is in

other respects uncertain, informal and insufficient and does

not state facts sufficient to entitle the State to any relief.

The motion should be granted on the ground that the

suit is one against the United States, under the authority

of Louisiana v. Garfield, 211 U. S. 70. In that case a bill

was brought in this court to establish the title of the

State of Louisiana to certain swamp lands which it claimed

under the statutes of the United States and to enjoin the

Secretary of the Interior and other officers of the Land

Department from carrying out an order making different

disposition of the land.

Under the statute it was contended the land vested in

the State in fee simple, that is, the act was contended to

have the same character and efficacy as the Act of June 21,

1898, is asserted to have in the case at bar. And certain

facts were necessary to be determined as elements of

decision. This court said that in the case there were

questions of law and of fact upon which-the United States

would have to be heard. So in the present case there is a

question of law whether the Act of June 21, 1898, had the

quality as a grant of the land asserted of it, whether of

itself--or because of its terms or \their prior construction

and its adoption, indeed, whether there was such a prior

construction or its adoption, and again of the fact of the

character of the land at the time of the grant -and the

evidence of it and the knowledge of it. It would-seem, besides, that under the averments of

the bill Keepers is an indispensable party, he having be-

come, according to the bill, a purchaser of the land and

paid the purchase price thereof. To make him a party

"would oust this court of jurisdiction, if he is a citizen of

New Mexico, and the presumption expressed by defend-

ants that he is, complainant does not deny. Californiav.

Syllabus.

The record before us not only fails to show that the fault of the "Selj a" might not have been one of the causes of the accident, or that it probably was not, or that it could not have been one of the causes of it, but, on the contrary, it clearly shows, as we have seen, that the negligent failure to observe the statutory rule contributed directly to cause the collision.
The case is not one for the application of refinements as to what would have been good seamanship without the, rule, such as we are invited in argument to consider, nor is it a case for consideration of the doctrine of major and minor fault. Both of the masters were palpably negligent in respects which contributed directly to cause the collision; the negligence of each continued to operate as an efficient cause until the moment when the accident occurred, and we agree with the lower courts that the case is one in which the master and owner of the "Selj a" must be left to suffer their self-inflicted loss.

State for the purpose of suing and being sued, was not intended to exclude them from resort to the federal courts. The purpose of the act as construed by the State Supreme Court was to permit them to sue in forma pauperis. 232 Fed. Rep. 708, affirmed.

THE case is stated in the opinion.

Mr. Roane Waring, with whom Mr. Luke E. Wright was on the brief, for petitioner.

Mr. Ike W. Crabtree,with whom Mr. Milton J. Anderson was on the briefs, for respondent.

MR. JUSTICE CLARKE delivered the opinion of the court.

The respondent, S. C. Moore, a citizen of Arkansas, in his representative capacity as administrator of the estate of Ivy B. Douglas,. deceased, under appointment by the Probate Court of Shelby County, Tennessee, sued the petitioner, the Memphis Street Railway Company, a corporation organized under the laws of Tennessee, in the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, for wrongfully causing the death of his decedent. He recovered judgment, which was affirmed by the Circuit 'Court of Appeals and the case is here on certiorari for review of the holding of that court that the plaintiff had legal capacity to maintain the suit in a federal court.
On the fabe of the declaration there was the requisite diversity of citizenship to give the federal court jurisdiction, but the petitioner claims that the respondent, Moore, although a citizen of Arkansas, must be treated as a citizen of Tennessee under the statute of that State, entitled "An Act to declare that for the purpose of suing and being sued, a nonresident of Tennessee, who qualifies as executor or administrator in Tennessee shall be considered a citizen of Tennessee, and to provide for the service of

process upon him" (c. 501, p. 1344, Acts of 1903), which

provides:

"That whenever a nonresident of the State-of Tennessee

qualifies in this State as the executor or administrator of a

person dying in or leaving assets or property in this State,

for the purpose of suing and being sued, he shall be treated

as a citizen of this State."

The remainder of the act prescribes the method of

service of summons upon such a nonresident executor

or administrator.

.

Upon a full review of the legislation of the State in

Southern,Railway Co. v. Maxwell, 113 Tennessee, 464, the

Supreme Court of Tennessee decided that the sole pur-

pose of this act is to extend to such nonresident executors

and administrators as are described in it the privilege of

suing in the state courts in forma pauperis,and that the

effect of it, when read with the other statutes of the State

on the subject; is to confine this privilege to the people of

the State or to suits devoted to their interest, "since the

right is not extended to non-resident administrators

generally, but only to those who have qualified in this

State as the personal representative of persons dying or

leaving assets or property in this State." No conflict

with the Federal Constitution or laws being involved, this

construction of the state statute will be accepted by this

court as conclusive. Elmendorf v. Taylor, 10 Wheat.

152, 159; Old Colony Trust Co. v. Omaha, 230 U. S.100,

But irrespective of this rule we quite agree with this

authoritative declaration that the only purpose of the act

is to determine privileges in the state courts of nonresi-

dents who may be appointed administrators or executors

of the estates of persons such as are described in the act.

There is nothing whatever in the statute which indicates

any intention on the part of the legislature to exclude non-

resident executors or administrators from resort to fed-

No. 133. Submitted January 15, 1917.-Decided March 6, 1917.
The rule that concurrent findings of fact by two lower courts will not be disturbed unless clearly wrong is here applied in support of findings of fraud and breach of fiduciary duty resulting in a trust.
Defendant, as receiver of a national bank, contracted on its behalf, with the approval of the Comptroller of the Currency, for the purchase .of certain realty, used some of the bank's money in payments on the price, and, under apparent authority from the court, sold and assigned the contract for cash paid the bank. The assignee acted secretly for the defendant in taking the contract, and thereafter assigned it secretly to him as an individual. Defendant resigned as receiver, and subsequently the contract was fully performed and the real property became vested in a corporation whose shares for the most part were issued to the defendant. In a suit brought by his successor to regain the property for the bank, Held: (1) That the transaction was a gross breach of defendant's duty as receiver; (2) That he was estopped to claim that the purchase of the property was beyond the powers of the bank, Case v.

MR. JUSTICE DAY delivered the opinion of the court.

This is an action by John W. Schofield, as receiver of the Merchants' National Bank of Seattle, Washington, insolvent since 1895, against Charles H. Baker, receiver of the bank from 1895 to 1899, and others, seeking a decree declaring the defendants to be holders of certain real property in Seattle in trust for the plaintiff, and asking a conveyance thereof to the plaintiff.
The property in controversy is block' 430 of Seattle Tide Lands, a tract of some twelve acres, and the leasehold of the harbor area lying in front of that block. In conformity 'with the provisions of the state law, the Merchants' National Bank had, prior to its failure, made application to purchase these lands. After the failure and the appointment of Charles H. Baker, receiver, this application was accepted by the State Board of Land Commissioners, and upon January 12, 1897, a contract was entered into between the State of Washington and the bank, through the receiver, by which the State agreed to sell and the bank to purchase block 430 of Seattle Tide Lands for $1488, payable in ten annual installments, sub-

ject to all liens for filling, and all taxes and assessments that might be levied or assessed on the land, and with a forfeiture clause in case the bank should fail to pay any of the amounts, either principal, interest, taxes or assessments, when the same should become due and for six months thereafter. Permission to make this contract was obtained by the receiver from the Comptroller of the Currency, and thereafter partial payments were made upon the contract.
Upon October 6, 1897, by order of the United States Circuit Court upon the receiver's petition to that effect, he was authorized to sell at private sale certain doubtful personal assets of the defunct bank, and thereafter, Baker, as receiver, assigned to S. G. Simpson the contract above mentioned for the consideration of $198.80, the transfer being approved by the Commissioner of Public Lands.
The assignment authorized the State of Washington to receive from Simpson, or his assigns, the performance of all covenants and agreements specified in the contract to be performed by the bank, and upon such performance to execute to him a patent for such tide land. By virtue of the ownership by Simpson of the contract to purchase tide lands block No. 430, he became entitled, under the laws of the State of Washington, to the preference right to lease certain harbor area adjacent and appurtenant to block No. 430. Upon the purchase by Simpson of the contract to purchase the tide lands, there was issued to him by the State of Washington a certain lease, designated "Harbor Lease No. 181," covering the harbor area appurtenant to the block.
In March, 1899, the contract between the bank and the State of Washington for the purchase of block No. 430, together with the harbor lease, was transferred by Simpson to Baker in his personal capacity, the record title continuing in the name of Simpson. On August 11, 1905, Simpson, acting for and on behalf of Baker, assigned the

243 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

contract for the purchase of block No. 430, together with harbor lease No. 181, to one Norton, the consideration named being one dollar. This assignment contained the same authorization as to the patent to be issued by the State as was contained in the assignment to Simpson. On October 16, 1905, the State of Washington issued to Norton a patent covering block No. 430, with the exception of a strip of land, thirty feet wide, which had been granted to a railroad company. In August, 1907, there was organized under the laws of the State of Washington the Seattle Water Front Realty Company. Upon incorporation of this company, Norton conveyed to it block No. 430, together with harbor lease No. 181, in payment for the issue of its capital stock of $250,000. About ninety-five per cent. of the stock was issued to Baker or to others who held for him.
In April, 1899, and a month after receiving the assignment from Simpson, Baker resigned as receiver; whereupon A. W. Frater was appointed receiver. On February 12, 1913, Frater resigned, and the present plaintiff was appointed receiver in his stead, and this suit was immediately
begun. . Under this state of facts, the District Court entered a decree adjudging that the assignment by Baker to Simpson was fraudulent and was made for the sole use and benefit of Baker, and that the assignment of the contract to the defendant Norton by Simpson and the conveyance of Norton to the Seattle Water Front Realty Company were null and void. The decree provided that the Realty Company should execute and deliver to the clerk of the court below for the benefit of the plaintiff, as receiver, a deed covering its interest in block No. 430 and the assignment of harbor lease No. 181, and the receiver was directed to pay to the clerk of the court for the Realty Company the sum of $10,977.13, being the amount of the payment, with interest, made by the defendants to the State of

Both the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals found that the sale from Baker to Simpson was only colorable, and that Simpson purchased the property for Baker. Our consideration of the evidence must be governed by the well-settled rule in this court that, when two courts have reached the same conclusion on a question of fact, their finding will not be disturbed unless it is clear that their conclusion was erroneous. Stuart v. Hayden, 169 U. S. 1, 14; Baker v. Cummings, 169 U. S. 189, 198; Towson v. Moore, 173 U. S. 17, 24; Hy-yu-tse-mil-kin v. Smith, 194 U. S. 401, 412; Dun v.

S. 76, 78; Gilson v. United States, 234 U. S. 380, 383. The concurrent decisions of the courts upon the establishment of a trust as a question of fact will be followed unless shown to be clearly erroneous. Brainardv. Buck, 184 U. S.99.
The .various defenses urged in the court below and involved in the points argued in this court for the appellants must be considered in view of this finding of fact as to the nature of the transfer by Baker, as receiver, to Simpson.
That the secret arrangement between Baker and Simpson was fraudulent and a gross breach of the receiver's duty is too plain to require detailed consideration. Michoud v. Girod,4 How. 503, 555; Magruder v. Drury,235 U. S.106, 119.
It is urged that the contract of purchase was ultra vires the corporate powers of the bank. The Court of Appeals, in deciding this point, referred to the decisions of this court which have held that objections to the passing of title in

conveyances to National Banks, although made in excess of any legal.authority given the bank by the law, can only be made by the Government in a direct proceeding, and will not defeat the vesting of the title in the bank when it takes a conveyance in good faith for a valuable consideration. National Bank v. Matthews, 98 U. 'S. 621; National Bank v. Whitney, 103 U. S. 99; Reynolds v. Crawfordsville First National Bank, 112 U. S. 405; Thompson v. Saint Nicholas National Bank, 146 U. S. 240; Schuyler National Bank v. Gadsden, 191 U. S. 451.
But without questioning the correctness of this conclusion, we are of opinion that the authority of the bank to make this purchase, or of the Comptroller to approve of it, or of the court to order the sale of this asset upon the
petition of Baker, as receiver, need not necessarily be considered -in determining the right to recover in this proceeding.
Upon the plainest principles governing the relation of the parties here, in-view of the finding that there was a secret trust in Baker's favor in the transfer to Simpson, Baker could not be heard to question the authority by which he acquired the property ostensibly for the benefit of his trust, but in reality for himself in breach of his trust. To sanction this would be to permit Baker to take advantage of his own wrong. It is not for him to say that he can acquire title in fraud of his trust because the bank could not legally acquire it, or the Comptroller apprave or the court authorize, its sale. As the facts are found, Baker assumed to act upon the understanding that the bank owned the contract of purchase and under an order invoked by him he undertook to sell it for the benefit of the trust, but in reality conveyed it to one who secretly held it for him. Under such circumstances, the trustee can take nothing by his wrongful act and can be coitpelled to restore the property to the authorized representative of the trust estate.

OCTOBER TERM, 1916.

Opinion of the Court.

243 U. S.

Plaintiff relies greatly upon Case v. Kelly, 133 U. S. 21, where certain officers of a railroad had procured convey-
ances of lands intended to be used in the construction of the road and had taken title to themselves personally, and the railroad was seeking to recover the lands although forbidden by its charter to take and hold title to such lands. In this case, Mr. Justice Miller, speaking for the
court said: "We need not stop here to inquire whether this com-
pany can hold title to lands, which it is impliedly forbidden to do by its charter, because the case before us is not one in which the title to the lands in question has ever been vested in the railroad company, or attempted to be so vested. The railroad company is plaintiff in this action, and is seeking to obtain the title to such lands. It has no authority by the statute to receive such title and to own such lands, and the question here is, not whether the courts would deprive it of such lands if they had been conveyed to it, but whether they will aid it to violate the law and obtain a title which it has no power to hold. We think the questions are very different ones, and that while a court might hesitate to declare the title to lands received already, and in the possession and ownership of the company, void on the principle that they had no authority to take such lands, it is very clear that it will not make itself the active agent in behalf of the company in violating the law and enabling the company to do that which the law forbids."
But the present case is not sQ. Here the State has parted with its title, and made the contract to convey to the bank at the instance of the receiver who now seeks to hold the title for his own benefit in breach of his trust.
As to the defense of laches, both courts below found that the facts show entire want of knowledge on the part of the present plaintiff or his predecessor in office of the secret arrangement by which Baker acquired the title to

the contract of purchase. Until knowledge of this fraudulent transaction, or facts equivalent thereto, was brought home to those authorized to act, there could be no laches in the failure to prosecute the suit.
Nor do we find merit in the contention that the sevenyear statute of limitations (Remington & Ballinger's Annotated Codes and Statutes of Washington, § 789), in favor of persons in the actual and notorious possession of lands under claim of title in good faith, has any application here. Under the facts found Baker does not come within the class' protected by this statute.
Other points are urged but it is enough to say that we find no error in the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals, and it is
