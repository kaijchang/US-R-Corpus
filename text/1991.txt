JUSTICE BLACKMUN, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS joins,
dissenting.
An applicant for a stay pending the disposition of a petition for certiorari faces a heavy burden. The applicant must demonstrate (1) a likelihood of irreparable harm if the judgment below is not stayed; (2) a reasonable probability that certiorari will be granted; (3) a significant possibility that the judgment below will be reversed; and (4) that the balance of the equities tilts clearly in its favor. I do not think the Government has met the latter two conditions.
Eight federal judges have now considered the territorial reach of 8 U. S. C. §1253(h). Four have concluded that the statute does not apply in international waters, and four have concluded that it does. Given the thorough and careful reasoning of the majority and concurring opinions below, I do not see how the Court can conclude at this stage that the Government's likelihood of success on the merits is any better than even. That is not fatal to the Government's application, for if each party's chance of succeeding is equal, a strong showing on the equities can still carry the day for the Government. But no such showing has been made. While the Government has offered a vague invocation of harm to foreign policy, immigration policy, and the federal treasury, the plaintiffs in this case face the real and immediate prospect of persecution, terror, and possibly even death at the hands of those to whom they are being forcibly returned. So determined the District Court, to whose findings we should defer where the balance of equities is highly factual in nature. Block v. North Side Lumber Co., 473 U. S. 1307 (1985) (REHNQUIST, Circuit Justice).
I would deny the application for a stay.

No. 90-985. BRAY ET AL. v. ALEXANDRIA WOMEN'S HEALTH CLINIC ET AL. C. A. 4th Cir. [Certiorari granted, 498 U.S. 1119.] Motion of respondents for leave to file a brief on reargument granted with respect to arguments addressing the potential significance of Planned Parenthoodof SoutheasternPa. v. Casey, ante, p. 833, and the availability of injunctive relief for violations of 42 U. S. C. §1985(3), but denied with respect to arguments addressing the hindrance clause of 42 U. S. C. §1985(3). Petitioners may file a supplemental brief on reargument on or before September 17, 1992, responding to respondents' arguments regarding Planned Parenthood and the availability of injunctive relief. JUSTICE O'CONNOR would grant the motion in its entirety.
JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE BLACKMUN joins, dissenting.
In a statutory construction case that is important enough to
merit reargument, the Court should err on the side of allowing full discussion of the entire statute at issue. Without having examined the supplemental brief attached to respondents' motion, and noting the absence of any objection from petitioners, I would therefore allow it to be filed as a matter of course. Because I intend to read the entire supplemental brief in preparation for the reargument-despite the Court's peculiar order-I would welcome comment by petitioners on all issues discussed therein.

JUSTICE WHITE, dissenting.
The question in these cases is whether an amendment to the commentary to the United States Sentencing Guidelines should govern a sentencing which occurred prior to the effective date of the amendment. A majority of the Courts of Appeals have applied such an amendment when it clarified, but did not substantively change, the operation of an existing Guideline. E. g., United States v. Caballero, 290 U. S. App. D. C. 235, 242, n. 8, 936 F. 2d 1292, 1299, n. 8 (1991); United States v. Urbanek, 930 F. 2d 1512, 1514-1515 (CA10 1991); United States v. Lillard, 929 F. 2d 500, 502-503 (CA9 1991); United States v. Fiala,929 F. 2d 285, 290 (CA7 1991); United States v. Nissen, 928 F. 2d 690, 694-695 (CA5 1991); United States v. Perdomo,927 F. 2d 111, 116-117 (CA2 1991); United States v. Fells, 920 F. 2d 1179, 1184 (CA4 1990) (Wilkins, J.), cert. denied, 501 U. S. 1219 (1991).
In contrast, the Eighth Circuit has held that an amendment may not be applied before its effective date. See United States v. Watts, 940 F. 2d 332, 333 (1991); United States v. Dortch, 923 F. 2d 629, 632, n. 2 (1991). In these cases the Sixth Circuit did not apply an amendment that took effect after the petitioners had been sentenced in District Court. But see United States v. Sanchez, 928 F. 2d 1450, 1458-1459 (CA6 1991) (applying such an amendment).
The United States Sentencing Commission has not addressed this recurring issue. See 56 Fed. Reg. 22762-22797 (1991) (Nov. 1991 Guidelines amendments). See generally Braxton v. United States, 500 U. S. 344, 347-349 (1991). Accordingly, I would grant certiorari and consolidate these cases to resolve the conflict in the Courts of Appeals.

No. 91-95. REDDY v. LITTON INDUSTRIES, INC., ET AL. C. A. 9th Cir. Certiorari denied. Reported below: 912 F. 2d 291.
JUSTICE WHITE, dissenting.
One of the issues in this case is whether a person has standing to sue for a conspiracy to violate the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U. S. C. § 1962(d), if the wrongful acts alleged do not constitute "predicate acts" as defined in §1961(1). Following the lead of the Second Circuit in Hecht v. Commerce Clearing Hou8e, Inc., 897 F. 2d 21 (1990), the Ninth Circuit in this case held that petitioner lacked standing to assert a conspiracy claim under §1962(d) because he did not allege injury from overt acts which themselves are prohibited in the RICO statute. 912 F. 2d 291, 295 (1990).
The Court of Appeals recognized that a division in authority existed between the Second Circuit's view, as expressed in Hecht, and the Third Circuit's position propounded in Shearin v. E. F. Hutton Group, Inc., 885 F. 2d 1162 (1989). In Shearin,the Third Circuit had held that a person has standing to assert a § 1962(d) violation for overt acts of conspiracy that are not defined in §1961(1). 885 F. 2d, at 1166-1167. The Ninth Circuit explicitly rejected the Third Circuit's position and adopted the Second Circuit's rule.
Because a conflict exists among the Courts of Appeals on this important federal question, I would grant certiorari to consider it.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR, with whom JUSTICE KENNEDY joins,
dissenting.
Petitioner claims that the California Supreme Court reviewed his death sentence in a manner inconsistent with this Court's holding in Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S. 738 (1990). I agree; I would grant the petition, vacate petitioner's death sentence, and remand to the California Supreme Court.
At the guilt phase of a capital trial in California, the trier of fact determines whether the "special circumstances" alleged by the prosecution are true. Cal. Penal Code Ann. § 190.1(a) (West 1988). At the penalty phase, the trier of fact weighs any aggravating circumstances, including the special circumstances found to be true, against any mitigating circumstances. § 190.3.
At petitioner's trial, the jury found the existence of two special circumstances-that the murder was committed in the course of a kidnaping, and that the murder was accompanied by the infliction of torture. The California Supreme Court reversed the jury's finding as to the special circumstance of torture, because the jury was not instructed that the circumstance required proof of intent to torture. 52 Cal. 3d 1210, 1255, 805 P. 2d 899, 921 (1991). The court expressly found that the instructional error was not harmless, in light of the parties' failure to focus at trial on the issue of petitioner's intent to torture and because the evidence of such intent was not overwhelming. Ibid. The court nevertheless upheld the death sentence. In a single paragraph
added to the opinion two months after it was published, the court reasoned: "[T]he evidence of the shocking nature of the attack on the infant victim was properly before the jury. The erroneous special circumstance finding was only a 'statutory label' which

ORDERS

930

O'CONNOR, J., dissenting

could not have affected the verdict in light of the evidence properly before the jury." 52 Cal. 3d, at 1272, 805 P. 2d, at 933.
In my view, such cursory review is clearly insufficient under Clemons. Mississippi, like California, requires its juries to weigh aggravating and mitigating circumstances. In Clemons, the jury had considered an aggravating circumstance we assumed to be unconstitutionally vague-that the murder was "'especially hei-
nous, atrocious, or cruel."' 494 U. S., at 743. We held that the Mississippi Supreme Court could excise the erroneously considered aggravating circumstance and reweigh the evidence on its own; we did not require the court to remand for reweighing by the jury. Id., at 750. We also permitted the Mississippi Supreme Court to determine whether the jury would beyond a reasonable doubt have imposed the death sentence even in the absence of the error. Id., at 752. But because it was not clear whether the Mississippi Supreme Court had actually performed an independent reweighing of the evidence, and because the court had not engaged in a sufficient harmless error analysis based on the record, we vacated Clemons' death sentence and remanded, so that the Mississippi Supreme Court could choose one course or the other. Id., at 751-754.
I would do the same here. The California Supreme Court did not reweigh the aggravating and mitigating circumstances. The court instead appears to have chosen Clemons' second option, harmless error analysis. Rather than reviewing the record, however, to determine whether the jury would beyond a reasonable doubt have imposed the death sentence given a finding of one
special circumstance rather than two, the California Supreme
Court upheld the sentence based solely on the fact that the error did not alter the mix of evidence weighed by the jury at the
penalty phase. This holding is irreconcilable with Clemons: The unconstitutional vagueness of the "especially heinous" instruction did not change the mix of evidence presented to the jury in that case either, but that fact alone did not support a finding of harmlessness. The California Supreme Court's conclusion, moreover,
makes little sense: All jury instruction errors would be harmless under this reasoning, because none of them add to or subtract from the evidence considered by the jury.
In a different case, the California Supreme Court's brief discussion of this issue might be interpreted as a finding that the evidence of torture was so overwhelming that the instructional error

OCTOBER TERM, 1991

October 21, 30, November 1, 4, 1991

502 U. S.

was harmless, because a properly instructed jury would beyond a reasonable doubt have found the existence of the torture special circumstance. Here, however, the California Supreme Court explicitly refused to make such a finding. The decision below can only be interpreted as concluding that the invalidation of a special circumstance-in this case, one out of only two-is harmless whenever the same mix of evidence would have been presented to the jury in the error's absence. Because this conclusion cannot be squared with Clemons, I would vacate petitioner's death sentence and direct the California Supreme Court to review that sentence under the appropriate standard.

JUSTICE BLACKMUN, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS and JUSTICE O'CONNOR join, dissenting.
I would grant the stay. In my judgment, appellants have shown both a reasonable likelihood that four Justices will vote to note probable jurisdiction as well as a "fair prospect" of success on the merits. Lucas v. Townsend, 486 U. S. 1301, 1304 (1988) (KENNEDY, J., in chambers). In addition, I think the equities favor the appellants. See id., at 1305.
On May 14, 1991, the county submitted a reapportionment plan to the Attorney General for preclearance under § 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. That section provides that if the Attorney General does not object to a proposed plan within 60 days, the plan is deemed approved. See 42 U. S. C. § 1973c.
On June 24, the Department of Justice requested additional information. On July 12, 59 days after the county originally submitted its preclearance request, the Chief of the Justice Department's Voting Rights Section dispatched a letter to appellee announcing that
"the sixty-day period for the changes now before us will now run concurrently with receipt of all the supplemental information. Therefore, by September 3, 1991, we will make a determination on the instant changes. See the Procedures for the Administration of Section 5 (28 C. F. R. 51.39)."
On September 3, the Justice Department denied preclearance, finding that the county had not met its burden of showing that its redistricting and electoral plan "has neither a discriminatory purpose nor a discriminatory effect."
On September 13, a three-judge District Court denied appellants' motion for an injunction. Appellants filed their request for injunctive relief in this Court on October 13. Due to an error in

OCTOBER TERM, 1991

BLACKMUN, J., dissenting

502 U. S.

the Clerk's Office of this Court, the filing was not renewed here until October 31.
Section 5 requires political subdivisions to obtain either judicial or administrative preclearance before implementing a voting change. "If voting changes subject to §5 have not been precleared, §5 plaintiffs are entitled to an injunction prohibiting the [political subdivision] from implementing the changes." Clark v. Roemer, 500 U. S. 646, 652-653 (1991).
The District Court ignored this clear directive because it erroneously believed that the plan was precleared by the Attorney
General's failure to interpose an objection within 60 days. Within the original 60-day period, the Attorney General requested additional information, which reset the 60-day clock under §5. We have upheld the Attorney General's authority to extend
the time for consideration. Georgia v. United States, 411 U. S. 526, 539-541 (1973). Therefore, the Attorney General's September 3 objections were interposed in a timely fashion, and the plan was not precleared.
The District Court also erred in declining to enjoin the election on the grounds that substantial resources had already been expended. We rejected that argument last Term in Clark v. Roemer. The facts that the electoral process already had begun and candidates had expended time and resources on the election are not persuasive reasons to depart from §5's preclearance mandate.
Clark, 500 U. S., at 653. The equities, in my view, also balance in favor of appellants.
The Department of Justice argues that we should not grant the application for an injunction, although the District Court erred in refusing to enjoin the election, because appellants delayed too long in filing their motion to enjoin.
In July when it became apparent that Tunica County intended to move ahead with the election despite the Department of Justice's July 12 letter informing them of an ongoing investigation, appellants filed for a temporary restraining order in District Court. After the September 3 denial of preclearance, appellants immediately sought a preliminary injunction. After the September 13 decision of the three-judge District Court, appellants filed a motion for injunctive relief in this Court within 30 days. Appellants have displayed no lack of diligence in challenging this election.

502 U. S.

Indeed, it is the county that has contributed substantially to the injury that will be caused by enjoining the election at this late date. The parties and candidates had notice on June 24 and again on July 12 that the Department of Justice was concerned, and that preclearance might not be forthcoming on September 3. Since September 3 they have known that the Department of Justice did not preclear the election. Despite this notice, the county continued with election preparations. The mere passage of time does not create a balance of equities in the county's favor in the face of the county's failure to comply with the requirements of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

JUSTICE WHITE, dissenting.
In each of these cases, the petitioner has alleged that police used a traffic stop as a pretext for conducting a narcotics search. Gregory Cummins was stopped after he failed to proceed through an intersection when the traffic light turned green. 920 F. 2d 498 (CA8 1990). William Trigg was arrested for driving with a suspended license. 925 F. 2d 1064 (CA7 1991) (case below); United States v. Trigg, 878 F. 2d. 1037 (CA7 1989). Mario EnriquezNevarez was pulled over after officers observed that his truck had a broken taillight. 931 F. 2d 890 (CA5 1991) (affirmance order). Each search led to the recovery of illegal drugs.
The Courts of Appeals for the Eighth, Seventh, and Fifth Circuits held that, because a reasonable police officer could have made the traffic stops, the evidence produced by the searches was admissible. See also United States v. Causey, 834 F. 2d 1179 (CA5 1987) (en banc). Cf. United States v. Nersesian, 824 F. 2d 1294 (CA2), cert. denied, 484 U. S. 958 (1987); United States v. Hawkins, 811 F. 2d 210 (CA3), cert. denied, 484 U. S. 833 (1987). The petitioners contend that the evidence should have been suppressed because no reasonable police officer would have made such traffic stops, and hence the stops were pretexts to investi-

502 U. S.

November 12, 1991

gate other crimes for which there were not grounds to stop. See United States v. Guzman, 864 F. 2d 1512 (CA10 1988); United States v. Smith, 799 F. 2d 704 (CAll 1986).
In recent months, this Court has denied review of at least two other cases raising pretextual search claims. See, e. g., Anderson v. Illinois, ante, p. 824; Hope v. United States, 499 U. S. 983 (1991). I would grant certiorari to address this recurring issue and to resolve the split in the Courts of Appeals.

JUSTICE WHITE, dissenting.
A key question in this case is whether the Double Jeopardy Clause applies to triallike sentence enhancement proceedings in noncapital cases. In Bullington v. Missouri,451 U. S. 430 (1981), this Court held that the Clause was implicated in such proceedings in the capital context. We expressly declined to address the applicability of the Clause to noncapital sentence enhancement proceedings in Lockhart v. Nelson, 488 U. S. 33, 37, n. 6 (1988). The New York Court of Appeals in this case held that Double Jeopardy Clause principles did not preclude the State from seeking a second sentence enhancement after it failed to establish the requisite statutory predicate for enhancement in the first proceeding. 78 N. Y. 2d 932, 933, 579 N. E. 2d 208 (1991).
Other courts take the contrary view. See, e. g., Durosko v. Lewis, 882 F. 2d 357, 359 (CA9 1989), cert. denied, 495 U. S. 907 (1990), and Bullard v. E8telle, 665 F. 2d 1347, 1361 (CA5 1982), vacated and remanded on other grounds, 459 U. S. 1139 (1983), both cases holding that double jeopardy analysis applies in sentence enhancement proceedings.
Because this division in authority should be resolved, I believe the Court should grant certiorari.

JUSTICE WHITE, with whom JUSTICE BLACKMUN joins, dissenting.
This lawsuit stems from a denial of accident insurance benefits by the administrator of an Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) plan. See 88 Stat. 891, 29 U. S. C. § 1132 (a)(1)(B). In Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Bruch, 489 U. S. 101,

OCTOBER TERM, 1991

November 18, 1991

502 U. S.

115 (1989), we reasoned that "the validity of a claim to benefits under an ERISA plan is likely to turn on the interpretation of terms in the plan" and therefore held that decisions of a plan administrator concerning eligibility for benefits ordinarily should be subject to de novo review.
Since our decision in Bruch, a disagreement has developed in the Courts of Appeals concerning the standard of review to be applied when a benefits decision turns on the facts of the case, rather than the interpretation of the terms in the ERISA plan. The Third and Fourth Circuits have held that a decision of a plan administrator should be reviewed de novo. Luby v. Teamsters Health, Welfare, and Pension Trust Funds, 944 F. 2d 1176 (CA3 1991); Reinking v. PhiladelphiaAmerican Life Ins. Co., 910 F. 2d 1210 (CA4 1990). See also Petrilli v. Drechsel, 910 F. 2d 1441 (CA7 1990) (dicta). However, in the present case, the Fifth Circuit ruled that an abuse of discretion standard should be applied. 932 F. 2d 1552 (1991).
I would grant certiorari to resolve the conflict in the Courts of Appeals on this important issue.

Opinion of JUSTICE BLACKMUN, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS and JUSTICE O'CONNOR join, respecting the denial of the petition for writ of certiorari.
This is a capital case. Since the present Term began on October 7, 1991, the Court has considered 102 capital petitions, each seeking review of a decision of a State's highest court. Even if practical considerations did not preclude review on the merits of all such petitions, another consideration often argues against granting certiorari: In many of these cases, a federal habeas proceeding is necessary to develop further the petitioner's claims, both factually and legally. This is one such case. Because I believe the evidence raises serious questions about whether petitioner was guilty of the charged crime or was capable of representing himself, I write to underscore the importance of affording petitioner meaningful federal habeas review.
On February 5, 1985, a woman was murdered in a field behind the After Midnight Club in Virginia Beach, Va. Petitioner O'Dell had been at that bar during the evening. There was no evidence that he previously had known the woman or that they had spoken or departed together. O'Dell left the bar some time after the victim did and went to another bar where he got into a fight. The following day, O'Dell arrived at his former girlfriend's house. Thereafter, the former girlfriend found bloodstained clothing in her garage and turned it over to the police. O'Dell was charged with murder.
Shortly before the trial, the court excused O'Dell's public defender because of an unspecified conflict. A new attorney was appointed, but O'Dell sought permission to proceed pro se after the attorney acquiesced in the Commonwealth's motion to have

OCTOBER TERM, 1991

O'Dell examined by a court-appointed psychiatrist.' Following
his examination by a local psychiatrist, the court found O'Dell
competent to proceed pro se and ordered the attorney to act as standby counsel. Several times during the trial, the judge commented on O'Dell's inability to "emotionally control" himself, see, e. g., 22 Tr. 44, and on one occasion informed O'Dell that his outbursts "concern me as to whether you are in fact in need of a reevaluation." 23 Tr. 21. Despite entreaties by standby counsel, the court refused to order a reevaluation.
The Commonwealth's evidence at trial consisted of tire tracks that were "similar" to those left by petitioner's car, blood tests, and testimony by a fellow inmate that O'Dell had confessed to
committing the murder. The court refused O'Dell's request for a hearing on the reliability of the blood tests and allowed the technician to opine that the blood samples taken from O'Dell's shirt
and jacket were consistent with samples taken from the victim. The court also denied O'Dell's proffer of evidence that the inform-
ant had offered to manufacture evidence in other trials as a means of avoiding prison terms.2 O'Dell was convicted and sentenced to death. The conviction and sentence were upheld on appeal.
O'Dell continued to maintain his innocence during state habeas proceedings. He introduced the results of DNA testing that demonstrated that the blood found on his shirt either was not the victim's or could not reliably be linked to the victim. O'Dell also argued that the trial court erred in allowing him to represent himself, given his history of mental illness and his behavior at trial. See Faretta v. California, 422 U. S. 806 (1975); Drope v. Missouri, 420 U. S. 162, 181 (1975). The Virginia Circuit Court denied state habeas relief, specifically holding that the fact that current testing methods would have produced a different result does not justify the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus. The state court also ruled that O'Dell had been competent to represent himself.8

'O'Dell previously had been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic and
ha2d engaged in erratic behavior prior to trial. Subsequent to O'Dell's trial, the informant was given three years' proba-
tion on a breaking and entering charge, despite contrary assurances by the prosecution to petitioner's counsel and the court.
sPetitioner raised a number of other substantial federal claims, including a challenge to remarks made in the prosecutor's closing argument that petitioner previously had violated his parole. Standby counsel had complained

Opinion of BLACKMUN, J.

Following the denial of state habeas relief by the Virginia Circuit Court, O'Dell filed a timely notice of appeal with the Virginia Supreme Court. Having interpreted the relevant subsection of the Virginia Code as providing for an appeal as of right, O'Dell's counsel then filed timely assignments of error.4 On March 6, 1991, a week after the filing deadline, the Deputy Clerk of the Virginia Supreme Court and the attorney for the Commonwealth informed petitioner's counsel that, in their opinion, O'Dell did not have an appeal as of right and thus O'Dell also needed to file a petition for appeal. At the same time, the Commonwealth's attorney allegedly informed petitioner's counsel that he would not oppose O'Dell's supplementation of his filings with the additional
document. Two days later, however, when O'Dell filed a motion to perfect his appeal, the Commonwealth opposed the motion. On March 15, O'Dell filed his petition for appeal. On April 1, the Virginia Supreme Court denied O'Dell's motion and rejected his appeal. The Commonwealth now argues that the Virginia Supreme Court's rejection of O'Dell's appeal bars review of the merits of the federal questions raised by O'Dell in the Common-
wealth's courts. The Virginia Supreme Court's dismissal of O'Dell's habeas peti-
tion should not deprive a federal habeas court of jurisdiction.

to the trial court that the argument was made in such a way as to convince the jury that it had only two options: either sentence petitioner to death or turn him loose on the streets to kill again. In fact, petitioner could receive
only the death sentence or life without parole. The trial court refused petitioner's request for a curative instruction or a chance to rebut the prosecutor's misleading statements. In his state habeas proceedings, petitioner argued that the trial court had violated Gardner v. Florida, 430 U. S. 349 (1977), which held that a defendant is denied due process of law when his
death sentence is imposed, at least in part, on the basis of information that he had no opportunity to deny or explain. The Virginia Circuit Court held
that this challenge was barred by res judicata under Hawks v. Cox, 211 Va. 91, 175 S. E. 2d 271 (1970).
A Virginia statute provides that a habeas decision in a capital case is appealable directly to the Virginia Supreme Court. See Va. Code Ann. § 17116.05:1(B) (1988); Hill v. Commonwealth, 8 Va. App. 60, 69, 379 S. E. 2d 134, 139 (1989). The wording~of this statute-"appeals lie directly to the Supreme Court"-suggests an appeal as of right, rather than a discretionary petition for appeal. The other categories of cases listed in this subsection require the filing of assignments of error, not a petition for appeal.

OCTOBER TERM, 1991

Opinion of BLACKMUN, J.

502 U. S.

Under Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68, 74-75 (1985), the Virginia Supreme Court's rejection may not be based on an independent state ground because Tharp v. Commonwealth, 211 Va. 1, 175 S. E. 2d 277 (1970), requires the Virginia Supreme Court to consider whether a constitutional right was abridged before denying an extension of time for filing a petition for appeal.5 The Virginia Supreme Court's rejection of O'Dell's appeal may also be an inadequate state ground. In James v. Kentucky, 466 U. S. 341 (1984), this Court held that only firmly established state procedural rules interpose a bar to the adjudication of federal constitutional
claims. The ambiguity of the Virginia statute, Va. Code Ann. § 17-116.05:1B (1988), as to whether capital appeals are discretionary or as of right may preclude its use as a procedural bar.6 See also Ford v. Georgia, 498 U. S. 411 (1991) (state practice must be firmly established and regularly followed in order to prevent subsequent review by this Court); NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Flowers, 377 U. S. 288, 297 (1964) (application of procedural rule was pointless, severe, and consequently inadequate as jurisdictional bar to review).
Finally, federal review of O'Dell's claims is possible if it is necessary to prevent a fundamental miscarriage of justice, see Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 757 (1991), or if the constitutional violation caused the conviction of an innocent person. See
McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 502 (1991). In short, there are serious questions as to whether O'Dell com-
mitted the crime or was capable of representing himself-questions rendered all the more serious by the fact that O'Dell's life depends upon their answers. Because of the gross injustice that

6While this Court rejected a similar argument in Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 742 (1991), this case may be distinguishable. Coleman dealt
with an untimely notice of appeal, not an untimely petition for appeal. Since the notice and assignments were timely, the Commonwealth was not unaware of petitioner's arguments, as it arguably was in Coleman. The Commonwealth's initial willingness to extend petitioner's time to perfect his appeal provides additional evidence that Virginia can waive the untimeliness rule when fundamental constitutional issues are at stake.
6As has been noted, see n. 4, supra, the wording of this statute-"appeals lie directly to the Supreme Court"-suggests an appeal as of right, rather than a discretionary petition for appeal. According to petitioner's counsel,
even the Clerk's office and the Commonwealth's attorney were uncertain as to whether petitioner was entitled to an appeal as of right.

would result if an innocent man were sentenced to death, O'Dell's substantial federal claims can, and should, receive careful consideration from the federal court with habeas corpus jurisdiction over the case.
No. 91-5852. MARTIN V. KNOX ET AL. C. A. 3d Cir. Certiorari denied. Reported below: 945 F. 2d 395.
Opinion of JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE BLACKMUN joins, respecting the denial of the petition for writ of certiorari.
On November 4, 1991, the Court applied its recently amended Rule 39.8 to eight petitions filed by James L. Martin. Instead of simply denying those certiorari petitions on the ground that they lacked merit, the Court denied Martin leave to proceed in forma pauperis on the ground that the petitions were repetitive and frivolous. Zatko v. California,ante, p. 16. I dissented from that action, in part, because drawing distinctions between those petitions that are frivolous and those that are merely meritless is a wasteful use of this Court's resources. The Court should simply deny certiorari once a determination is made that the petition lacks merit; there is no reason for the Court to make an additional inquiry into whether the petition is frivolous and thus the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis should be denied instead. The point is illustrated by the Court's correct disposition of this petition filed by Martin.
The petition is not frivolous because it raises a question on which the Courts of Appeals are in conflict. Compare In re Beard, 811 F. 2d 818, 827 (CA4 1987) (district judge's failure to disqualify himself can be reviewed by a petition for writ of mandamus); Union Carbide Corp. v. U. S. Cutting Service, Inc., 782 F. 2d 710, 713 (CA7 1986) (same), with Pittsburgh v. Simmons, 729 F. 2d 953, 954 (CA3 1984) (judge's failure to recuse himself is reviewable only after final judgment); Cleveland v. Krupansky, 619 F. 2d 576, 578 (CA6) (same), cert. denied, 449 U. S. 834 (1980). Accordingly, it would be inappropriate to invoke Rule 39.8 and deny Martin's motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis. I nevertheless agree that it is proper to deny the certiorari petition because it appears that the underlying recusal motion has no merit.

Opinion of JUSTICE STEVENS, respecting the denial of the petition for writ of certiorari.
For the reasons stated in JUSTICE BLACKMUN'S dissenting opinion, there is no escape from the conclusion that the Court of Appeals committed error in this case. I write only to note that I find it difficult to articulate an acceptable theory of discretionary review that would explain both the Court's denial of certiorari in this case and its summary reversal in Mireles v. Waco, ante, p. 9 (per curiam), and Hunter v. Bryant, ante, p. 224 (per curiam).
JUSTICE BLACKMUN, with whom JUSTICE O'CONNOR and JUSTICE SOUTER join, dissenting.
Petitioner Roy Smith claims that the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reviewed his conviction in a manner inconsistent with this Court's precedents on the application of harmless-error analysis. I agree. I would grant the petition, summarily vacate the judgment, and remand the case to the Court of Appeals.
Petitioner and a codefendant, Slade Miller, were tried jointly for federal murder and conspiracy to commit murder, in violation of 18 U. S. C. §§ 1111 and 1117, on charges arising from the killing of a fellow inmate at Lorton Reformatory in Virginia. The Government's case relied in significant part on the testimony of Cor-

1018

OCTOBER TERM, 1991

BLACKMUN, J., dissenting

502 U. S.

nell Warren, another co-conspirator who had entered into a cooperating plea agreement. Warren established the link between Smith and Miller and introduced statements by still another coconspirator (who did not testify) that Smith had obtained shanks (prison-made knives) in preparation for the killing. Warren also
testified that Smith had used a shank to stab the victim. Other witnesses testified that Miller stabbed the victim, while Smith restrained the only guard in the room.
On cross-examination, the court pre-empted defense counsel's
attempt to question Warren about his possible incentives for testifying as a Government witness. In response to the judge's questioning, Warren gave contradictory testimony as to whether or not his lawyer had told him that he would probably receive a lesser sentence by pleading guilty than if he were tried and convicted. Over defense counsel's objections, the court then refused
to permit further questions. The jury convicted Smith of conspiracy to commit murder and second-degree murder.
Smith appealed, asserting that the court had violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment by denying him the ability to show bias or self-interest in the witness. For purposes of the appeal, the Court of Appeals assumed that
constitutional error was committed and that reversal was required unless the error could be found to be harmless beyond a reason-
able doubt. In reviewing the Government's evidence against Smith, the
Court of Appeals explained that it was "[e]ssentially discounting Warren's testimony except as it is corroborated by other evidence, and considering all that remains in the light most favorable to
the government . . . ." See United States v. Smith, No. 89-5475
(CA4, Dec. 10, 1990), App. to Pet. for Cert. 12, affirmance order, 919 F. 2d 734. The court found that this evidence, "obviously
sufficient to convict if believed," was contradicted only by "Smith's facially implausible testimony that he held the guard only to protect him." App. to Pet. for Cert. 13. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals held that any error in restricting Smith's impeachment of Warren was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
As we made clear in Satterwhite v. Texas, 486 U. S. 249 (1988),
the question "is not whether the legally admitted evidence was sufficient to support" the verdict; rather, the question is "whether
the [prosecution] has proved 'beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained."'

BLACKMUN, J., dissenting

Id., at 258-259, quoting Chapman v. California,386 U. S. 18, 24 (1967). In short, the adequacy of the legally admitted evidence is only one of the factors to be considered in determining the influence that the error had upon the jury. See, e. g., Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279, 297-300 (1991) (focusing on the
contribution of the coerced confession); Satterwhite, 486 U. S., at 259-260 (focusing on the contribution of testimony on future dangerousness).
In my view, the Court of Appeals misapplied harmless-error
analysis in two respects. First, it gave only cursory consideration to how the error contributed to the verdict, summarily stating that Warren's testimony, "though undoubtedly helpful to the prosecution because he was a charged co-conspirator, was to a large extent either cumulative or generally corroborated by other testimony." App. to Pet. for Cert. 13. Rather, the Court of Appeals relied on its conclusion that the legally admitted evidence was "obviously sufficient to convict if believed." Ibid. The Court of Appeals' focus on the adequacy of the legally admitted evidence was error.
The Court of Appeals then compounded this error by consider-
ing the legally admitted evidence "in the light most favorable to the government." Id., at 12. We have consistently held since Chapman that constitutional error "casts on someone other than the person prejudiced by it a burden to show that it was harmless." 386 U. S., at 24. See also Fulminante, 499 U. S., at 296 (prosecution has burden of demonstrating that admission of confession did not contribute to conviction); Satterwhite, 486 U. S., at 258-259. The Court of Appeals' review of the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government improperly shifted the
burden to Smith. In sum, focusing on the legally admitted evidence in the light
most favorable to the Government "preserves" the factfinder's weighing of the evidence. Such preservation is desirable when
the reviewing court is examining the legal sufficiency of the evidence. See Jackson v. Virginia,443 U. S. 307, 319 (1979). Once the reviewing court has identified a constitutional error, however,
it should not preserve the factfinder's tainted deliberation-it should dissect it. The reviewing court then must require "the beneficiary of a constitutional error to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained." Chapman, 386 U. S., at 24. Because the Court

1020

of Appeals' unpublished opinion* cannot be squared with our harmless-error precedents, I would vacate the judgment and direct the Court of Appeals to review the sentence under the proper standard.

*The fact that the Court of Appeals' opinion is unpublished is irrelevant.
Nonpublication must not be a convenient means to prevent review. An unpublished opinion may have a lingering effect in the Circuit and surely is as important to the parties concerned as is a published opinion.

These cases raise the issue whether the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FE LA), 35 Stat. 65, as amended, 45 U. S. C. §§ 5160, creates a cause of action for emotional injury brought about by acts that lack any physical contact or threat of physical contact. We had expressly reserved this question in Atchison, T & S. F. R. Co. v. Buell, 480 U. S. 557, 570-571 (1987). In both cases the Courts of Appeals held that FELA authorizes no such claim.
By contrast with the approach undertaken by the Courts of Appeals in these cases, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has propounded a contrary rule. In Plaisance v. Texaco, Inc., 937 F. 2d 1004, 1009 (1991), after fully canvassing the decisions of the Courts of Appeals since Buell, the court stated: "We [are] persuaded that an emotional injury can be every bit as harmful, debilitating, and destructive of the quality of one's life as a physical injury. We therefore hold that a claim for an emotional injury caused by emotional distress negligently inflicted, even without an accompanying physical injury or physical contact, is cognizable under the FELA."
Because a uniform rule should be announced by this Court on this important and recurring issue, I would grant the petitions.

JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE BLACKMUN joins, dissenting.
The direct review of petitioner's conviction was not completed until November 18, 1991, when this Court denied certiorari. See ante, p. 969. Petitioner's lawyer, a solo practitioner, was unable to represent petitioner in postconviction proceedings. Meanwhile, an execution date of January 17, 1992, had already been set by the trial court. Petitioner, who is indigent, was unable to find a lawyer to represent him until December 27, 1991. On January 3, 1992, petitioner's new lawyer requested a modification of the execution date so that he could familiarize himself with the record; however, his request was denied.
On January 15, 1992, petitioner filed an application for postconviction writ of habeas corpus in the trial court and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. The next day, the trial court denied a stay of execution. Within the span of a few hours, the Court of Criminal Appeals adopted the trial court's findings and denied the application; the District Court denied petitioner's first federal habeas petition an hour after it was filed; and the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the denial of federal habeas corpus relief by a divided court.
Writing in dissent, Judge Davis explained that he would "grant the stay in this initial federal habeas petition" because he was "unable to adequately assess Clark's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel without reviewing the pertinent portions of the trial record, which are not now available to [him]." No. 92-2036 (CA5, Jan. 16, 1992), p. 7, judgt. order reported at 953 F. 2d 642.
As a matter of policy, I believe that we should routinely grant the stay application in all first federal habeas corpus cases "in order to be sure that a death row inmate may have the same

ORDERS

502 U. S.

opportunity to have his or her federal claims considered by this Court as does any other applicant." Kyles v. Whitley, 498 U. S. 931 (1990) (STEVENS, J., concurring in denial of application). This case, however, presents an extreme example of why this is so. The compressed schedule has denied state and federal courts the
opportunity to review filings with adequate time for reflection, much less to review the record, or even to receive a full response from the State.* Indeed, it is doubtful that counsel has had a fair opportunity to discharge his professional obligations. Thus, the more prudent approach is to grant a stay and to have procedures follow in their proper course. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.

*The State, in response to petitioner's federal habeas petition, said that
its "non-opposition" was based "on the recognition that additional time may be necessary in order for the Court to resolve the claims asserted by Clark," and also because the State has had to prepare for several executions in the space of a week and "simply has not adequately digested the record in light of Clark's claims, received only this morning."

"3. When a district court bases a departure decision on an aggravating or mitigating circumstance that the court of appeals later determines is improper under 18 U. S. C. §3553(b), has the district court imposed a sentence 'in violation of law' within the meaning of §§3742(e)(1) and (f)(1)?"

JUSTICE WHITE, dissenting.
This case presents the question whether the Eleventh Amendment bars a suit for retroactive monetary relief against a State, if recovery is sought from funds which are segregated from the general revenues or which come from the Federal Government. Two forms of unemployment benefits are at issue in this case. Both are paid from funds segregated from general state funds. One is wholly financed by the Federal Government. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit took the position that the source of state funds should be disregarded and declined to follow the "'trust fund doctrine."' Paschal v. Jackson, 936 F. 2d 940, 944 (1991). The court held that a claim for retroactive monetary relief against the State was barred by the Eleventh Amendment, notwithstanding the segregation of funds and the fact of federal financing. Id., at 945. In another case involving a suit seeking payment of unemployment benefits, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has similarly rejected the view that a State's sovereign immunity may be abrogated where relief would be paid out of a special revenue fund. Esparza v. Valdez, 862 F. 2d 788, 794 (1988). That court held that, no matter what fund a judgment for past damages comes from, it is still a judgment against the State and as such is barred by the Eleventh Amendment. Id., at 795.
Other Courts of Appeals have taken a contrary view of the effect of the Eleventh Amendment in similar circumstances. In

1082

OCTOBER TERM, 1991

January 27, 1992

502 U. S.

Brown v. Porcher,the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that a federal court could award a judgment against the South Carolina unemployment compensation fund, because that fund was segregated from general state revenues. 660 F. 2d 1001 (1981), cert. denied, 459 U. S. 1150 (1983) (WHITE, Powell, and REHNQUIST, JJ., dissenting). The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has held that a federal court could order retroactive relief against the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare (DPW), at least to the extent that the DPW would be reimbursed by the Federal Government. Bennett v. White, 865 F. 2d 1395, 1408, cert. denied, 492 U. S. 920 (1989). In Foggs v. Block, the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit found that the Eleventh Amendment did not bar a federal court from ordering the restoration of food stamp benefits where the Federal Government bore the cost of the program. 722 F. 2d 933, 941, n. 6 (1983), rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Atkins v. Parker,472 U. S. 115 (1985).

BLACKMUN, J., dissenting

JUSTICE THOMAS, respecting the denial of certiorari.
On January 31, 1992, I voted to deny the Government's application to stay the District Court's injunctions in this case because, in my view, the petitioners deserved the additional 24 hours they had requested for the purpose of taking depositions and filing a response. Ante, p. 1083. The petitioners have since briefed the merits of their petition for certiorari, and I now conclude that under the standards this Court has traditionally employed, cf. this Court's Rule 10.1, the petition should be denied.
The affidavits filed throughout this litigation have sought to describe the conditions in Haiti and the treatment the returnees have received there. I am deeply concerned about these allegations. However, this matter must be addressed by the political branches, for our role is limited to questions of law. Because none of the legal issues presented in this petition provides a basis for review, I join the Court's denial of certiorari.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN, dissenting from denial of certiorari.
The world has followed with great concern the fate of thousands of individuals who fled Haiti in the wake of that country's September 1991 military coup. As the complex procedural history of this case reveals, the legal issues surrounding the rights of Haitians interdicted on the high seas by the United States Coast Guard have deeply divided the four federal judges who have considered their claims. Each of the issues presented-whether the United States Government is violating the First Amendment by denying lawyers from the Haitian Refugee Center a right of access to the Haitians held at Guantanamo Bay; whether international or domestic law affords the Haitians a substantive right not to be returned to a country where they face possible persecution; and whether the Haitians may challenge the adequacy of procedures employed by the United States Government to identify those facing political persecution-is difficult and susceptible to competing interpretations.
A quick glance at this Court's docket reveals not only that we have room to consider these issues, but that they are at least as significant as any we have chosen to review today. If indeed the Haitians are to be returned to an uncertain future in their strifetorn homeland, that ruling should come from this Court, after full and careful consideration of the merits of their claims.
I dissent from the Court's decision to deny a writ of certiorari.

Earlier this Term, the Court applied its new Rule 39.81 for the first time, denying in forma pauperis status to two indigent litigants-Vladimir Zatko and James Martin. Zatko v. Califor-
nia, 502 U. S. 16 (1991) (per curiam). In explaining its action, the Court emphasized that Zatko and Martin were "unique." Id.,
at 18. What distinguished these petitioners, the Court explained, was not the frivolousness, but the frequency of their filings. In-
deed, the Court found it "important to observe" that it had not applied Rule 39.8 to numerous other frivolous petitions. Ibid. The Court noted that these other petitions were denied "in the usual manner, underscoring our commitment to hearing the claims, however meritless, of the poor." Ibid.
Zatko had filed 73 petitions in this Court over the past 10 years; Martin had filed more than 45. Id., at 17. In invoking Rule 39.8 today, the Court denies leave to proceed in forma pauperis to petitioner Jos in this Court.2eph Head. Head has previously filed one petition
Today's action thus represents an unexplained expansion of Rule 39.8 and an apparent rejection of the explanation for the action taken with respect to petitioners Zatko and Martin. I would grant leave to proceed informa pauperis,deny the petition for writ of certiorari, and get on with the business of the Court.

No. 91-6781. KATTULA V. UNITED STATES. C. A. 4th Cir. Motion of petitioner for leave to proceed in forma pauperis de-

'This Court's Rule 39.8 provides:
"If satisfied that a petition for a writ of certiorari, jurisdictional statement, or petition for an extraordinary writ, as the case may be, is frivolous or malicious, the Court may deny a motion for leave to proceed in forma pa2uperis."
See Head v. Pinion, 500 U. S. 956 (1991).

JUSTICE WHITE, with whom JUSTICE BLACKMUN joins, dissenting.
This case concerns the appropriate standard for determining the admissibility of expert testimony. It is an issue that has long divided the federal courts, see Mustafa v. United States, 479 U. S. 953 (1986) (WHITE, J., joined by Brennan, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari), and here deeply divided the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, sitting en banc.

ORDERS

503 U. S.

March 2, 1992

Albert Roy Christophersen died of a rare form of cancer in 1986. Petitioners, his widow and son, brought suit, claiming that Christophersen's illness was caused by fumes from the manufacture of nickel/cadmium batteries in the factory where he had worked for 14 years. Petitioners based this claim upon the expert opinion of an internist and toxicologist. Respondents contended that there was no reliable basis for the expert's views and moved for summary judgment. The United States District Court for the Western District of Texas agreed that the doctor's affidavit was "not based upon the type of evidence usually relied upon by experts in the field of cancer research" and entered judgment for respondents. App. C to Pet. for Cert. 74-75.
A panel of the Court of Appeals reversed, 902 F. 2d 362 (1990), but on rehearing en banc, eight members of the court voted to affirm the judgment of the District Court, based in part on their conclusion that the admissibility of an expert witness' evidence should turn on whether his or her methodology is generally accepted within the scientific community. 939 F. 2d 1106 (1991) (per curiam). This standard, known as the Frye test, was announced almost 70 years ago. See Frye v. United States, 54 App. D. C. 46, 293 F. 1013 (1923). But five members of the Court of Appeals concluded that the Frye test was not the applicable evidentiary standard. 939 F. 2d, at 1116 (Clark, C. J., concurring in result); id., at 1122, 1136 (Reavley, King, Johnson, Wiener, JJ., dissenting in two opinions).
As the Fifth Circuit is divided, so the Courts of Appeals are in disagreement. Some continue to apply the approach set forth in Frye in deciding whether expert evidence is admissible. E. g., Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals,Inc., 951 F. 2d 1128 (CA9 1991); United States v. Two Bulls, 918 F. 2d 56 (CA8 1990); United States v. Smith, 869 F. 2d 348 (CA7 1989). But courts in other Circuits have concluded that Frye was superseded in 1975 by the Federal Rules of Evidence, which they maintain established a lower threshold for determining the admissibility of expert evidence. E. g., United States v. Jakobetz, 955 F. 2d 786 (CA2 1992); DeLuca v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals,Inc., 911 F. 2d 941 (CA3 1990). Because this is an important and recurring issue, I would grant certiorari to resolve the conflict.

Opinion of JUSTICE STEVENS, respecting the denial of the petition for writ of certiorari.
Petitioner asks us to resolve a recurring conflict among the Courts of Appeals concerning the meaning of a once obscure sentence in §3 of the Mississippi River Flood Control Act of 1928.1

1Section 3 of the statute, which is now codified as 33 U. S. C. §702c, reads
in full as follows: "SEC. 3. Except when authorized by the Secretary of War upon the rec-
ommendation of the Chief of Engineers, no money appropriated under au-
thority of this Act shall be expended on the construction of any item of the project until the States or levee districts have given assurances satisfactory

OCTOBER TERM, 1991

Opinion of STEVENS, J.

503 U. S.

During the past decade that sentence has assumed greater and greater importance because it has provided the Government with a defense to claims for personal injury and death caused by federal negligence, gross negligence, and even "conscious governmental indifference to the safety of the public." United States v.
James, 478 U. S. 597, 600 (1986) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).2
This is the latest in an expanding series of tragic cases. Jerome Hiersche, a professional diver, contracted with the Government to inspect submerged fish screens at the hydroelectric intake
on the John Day Dam on the Columbia River between Oregon
and Washington. Although Government employees assured him that the water flow to the fish bypass system would be shut off, they negligently failed to do so. Petitioner's head was drawn
into an orifice in the fish bypass system, and he suffered fatal injuries. The Government defended this wrongful-death action

to the Secretary of War that they will (a) maintain all flood-control works after their completion, except controlling and regulating spillway structures, including special relief levees; maintenance includes normally such matters as cutting grass, removal of weeds, local drainage, and minor repairs of main river levees; (b) agree to accept land turned over to them under the provisions of section 4; (c) provide without cost to the United States, all rights of way for levee foundations and levees on the main stem of the Mississippi River between Cape Girardeau, Missouri, and the Head of Passes.
"No liability of any kind shall attach to or rest upon the United States for any damage from or by floods or flood waters at any place: Provided, however, That if in carrying out the purposes of this Act it shall be found that upon any stretch of the banks of the Mississippi River it is impractica-
ble to construct levees, either because such construction is not economically justified or because such construction would unreasonably restrict the flood channel, and lands in such stretch of the river are subjected to overflow and damage which are not now overflowed or damaged by reason of the construction of levees on the opposite banks of the river it shall be the duty of the Secretary of War and the Chief of Engineers to institute proceedings on behalf of the United States Government to acquire either the absolute ownership of the lands so subjected to overflow and damage or floodage rights ov2er such lands." 45 Stat. 535-536 (emphasis added).
As one court noted, while Congress often enacts special legislation to aid the victims of floods, thus mitigating the harsh effect of §702c with respect to property damage, Congress does not pass special legislation to assist individuals who suffer personal injury in flood-control waters as a result of Government negligence. See Fryman v. United States, 901 F. 2d 79, 80 (CA7), cert. denied, 498 U. S. 920 (1990).

Opinion of STEVENS, J.

on the ground that the 1928 Act immunizes it from liability for all personal injuries caused by its employees in federal floodcontrol projects. Following this Court's unfortunate decision in James, as well as settled precedent in the Ninth Circuit,8 the District Court and the Court of Appeals sustained that defense.
Since 1928 when Congress authorized the construction of the levees on the banks of the Mississippi River, the number and importance of federal flood-control projects has grown dramatically. In addition to controlling floods, these projects generate hydroelectric power and create artificial lakes that serve impor-
tant recreational and conservation purposes. In some Circuits the Government's flood-control immunity would not constitute a defense in the case of injuries resulting from 6overnment conduct that was unrelated to any flood-control purpose, see, e. g., Boyd v. United States ex rel. United States Army, Corps of Engineers, 881 F. 2d 895 (CA10 1989); Hayes v. United States, 585 F. 2d 701 (CA4 1978). If this case had arisen in one of those Circuits, the claim would likely succeed because Hiersche's assignment related to fish conservation and power generation, rather than flood control. But in the Ninth Circuit, if flood control was one of the purposes of the Act of Congress authorizing the project itself, the immunity applies. 4 The Seventh Circuit has suggested that immunity might depend on whether the flood-control activities at the project increased the probability of injury. See Fryman v.
United States, 901 F. 2d 79 (CA7), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 920 (1990).
This Court has a duty to resolve conflicts among the courts of appeals. As several scholars have recognized, however, that duty is not absolute.' Some conflicts are tolerable. Others can be resolved more effectively by Congress. This is such a case.

'See McCarthy v. United States, 850 F. 2d 558 (1988), cert. denied, 489
U.4S. 1052 (1989). See McCarthy v. United States, 850 F. 2d, at 562; see also Zavadil v.
United States, 908 F. 2d 334 (CA8 1990) (per curiam), cert. denied, 498 U. S. 1108 (1991); Mocklin v. Orleans Levee District, 877 F. 2d 427 (CA5 1989).

The statute at issue here is an anachronism. It was enacted 18 years before the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U. S. C. § 2671 et
seq., waived the Federal Government's sovereign immunity from liability for personal injuries. At the time of its enactment, no consideration was given to the power generation, recreational, and conservation purposes of flood-control projects, or to their possible impact on the then nonexistent federal liability for personal injury and death caused by the negligent operation of such projects. Today this obsolete legislative remnant is nothing more than an engine of injustice. Congress, not this Court, has the primary duty to confront the question whether any part of this harsh immunity doctrine should be retained.

JUSTICE WHITE, with whom JUSTICE BLACKMUN joins, dissenting.
These cases present the question whether, following our decision in CaterpillarInc. v. Williams, 482 U. S. 386 (1987), a statelaw cause of action is pre-empted under §301 of the Labor Management Relations Act by a defense based on a collectivebargaining agreement. A state-law cause of action is pre-empted under § 301 if its resolution is "substantially dependent on analysis of a collective-bargaining agreement." Electrical Workers v. Hechler, 481 U. S. 851, 859, n. 3 (1987). See also Allis-Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck, 471 U. S. 202, 220 (1985).
In the decision below, petitioners based their claims solely on state law, but respondent's defense invoked the provisions of a collective-bargaining agreement. The Illinois court held that

ORDERS

503 U. S.

March 9, 1992

petitioners' state-law claims were pre-empted under § 301 because their resolution was substantially dependent on interpretation of the applicable collective-bargaining agreement. 213 Ill. App. 3d 169, 175-176, 571 N. E. 2d 1215, 1218 (1991). Several Federal Courts of Appeals similarly have held that a court must look to defenses to determine whether a claim requires interpretation of a collective-bargaining agreement. See, e. g., Smith v. ColgatePalmolive Co., 943 F. 2d 764, 769-771 (CA7 1991); Hanks v. General Motors Corp., 859 F. 2d 67, 70 (CA8 1988).
By contrast, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, relying on our decision in CaterpillarInc. v. Williams, has held that "in order for there to be section 301 preemption, the plaintiff, in its well-pleaded complaint, must plead an action that requires interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement." That court accordingly examined the claims presented in the complaint and found no § 301 pre-emption. Berda v. CBS Inc., 881 F. 2d 20, 25 (1989). See also McCormick v. AT & T Technologies, Inc., 934 F. 2d 531, 545 (CA4 1991) (en banc) (Phillips, J., dissenting). The Illinois court below expressly rejected the reasoning of Berda.
I would grant certiorari to resolve this conflict.

JUSTICE WHITE, with whom JUSTICE BLACKMUN joins, dissenting.
The issue in this case is whether the Ex Post Facto Clause of the Constitution, Art. I, §9, cl. 3, is violated when a newly modified state parole regulation is applied to a prisoner who began serving his sentence prior to the rule change.
Petitioner pleaded guilty to the 1976 kidnap, sexual abuse, and murder of a young girl; he was sentenced to three concurrent jail terms, the longest of which was 40 years. In 1981, the Minnesota Corrections Board determined that, because of the severity of petitioner's crimes, the target date for his release should be the expiration of his sentence. In a letter to petitioner, the board stated that it would "not consider any form of release prior to the expiration of your sentence unless psychiatric, psychological, and correctional staff can certify that you are no longer a danger to the public in general and/or young females specifically."
A year later, the Minnesota Legislature abolished the corrections board and transferred parole responsibility to the commis-

ORDERS

503 U. S.

March 23, 1992

sioner of corrections. Minn. Stat. § 243.05 (1990). The commissioner enacted new parole regulations, including a rule that "[a]ll release dates established by the Minnesota corrections board will be left in full force and effect by the commissioner." 3 Minn. Rule §2940.1500, subp. 2 (1991). Petitioner was informed that this new regulation effectively froze his release date.
Petitioner filed this civil rights action under Rev. Stat. § 1979, 42 U. S. C. § 1983, asserting that application of the new parole regulation to his case violated the Ex Post Facto Clause. The United States District Court for the District of Minnesota entered summary judgment for respondents. A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed, holding that "the Minnesota parole regulations are not 'laws' for ex post facto purposes ... ." Bailey v. Gardebring,940 F. 2d 1150, 1157 (1991). The court, again divided, denied rehearing en banc.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals conflicts with decisions of other Courts of Appeals, which have held that application of changed state parole regulations may pose ex postfacto problems. See, e. g., Akins v. Snow, 922 F. 2d 1558 (CAll), cert. denied, 501 U. S. 1260 (1991); Royster v. Fauver, 775 F. 2d 527 (CA3 1985). Because the issue is likely to arise frequently, I would grant certiorari to resolve the disagreement.
