himself with the permanent interest, of the count D . The rule is'modern,. and several exceptions have been made to it. In the case of the Phmnix the claim was made by persons of, Germany for property taken on a voyage from Surinymr to Hlnand, and described as the produce of their estates in Surinam, which was then a colony of Holland, with which Great Britain was at
war, G:'rmany being neutral. Sir Win. Scott admits that ifthe estates had been purchased while Surinam was in the posse.ssion of the British. the case would not have been Wvithin ile general rule. So in the case of the
Diana, 5 Rob. 60. (Eng. Ed._) those who settletd in De. .nararawhile it was under British protection, were held not to be within tile rule; aid fll, case of the Vroiw Alnna Catharina, '5Rob. 161. (Eng. Ed.).is' anot.her
modification of the rule. These cases were i xcupted,
because the proprietors had not incorporated themselves 'zvitl. the perman7ent interests of the ation.

In the present case Mr. Bentzon never incorporated

himself with the interests of theAritish nation. either

permanently or

yempToilrea.riclhy.aracter was forced

upon him against his will ; he always diclaiind it.
He was by birth, and always continued, a Danish subject. He did not voluntarily purchase. a plantation in
the country of the enemy. When he purchased his estate Santa Cruz was neutral. The occupation of the island by the British was temporary ; it was ni-ither permanentin fact nor in law. Peace has restored the island to Denmark. Mr. Bntzon could not, by means of -his estate in Santa'Cruz, incorporate lilmsdlf permanently with the interests of Great Britain.

2. But if the case comes wvihin th British rule, are we to adopt that rule, and'extend it to a neutral nation which has never itself adopted it.

It is but the ordinary case of a neutral carrying on 'Eis lawful trade with our enemy; and has nothing in it
contrary to the law of nationS.

The rule contended for is a mere arbitrary rul6, col-.
culated to extend the field of rapine and to increase the maritime power of Great Britain. We have no interest in aiding those views.

What is the law of nations? Not a rule adopted by 30 minn. one nation only,,but the law ef nature, of reason, and opsuGAR ofjustice, applied to the intercour.e 4 nations, and ad- V. initted by all such as are civilized. What is thure in no1YLnr the code of any other nation to support thi6 rule? It is &OTrns. to be found only in"the maritime code ol Great Britain;
which is not more binding tipon us than that of any other maritime power. It can have no force with us, but in cases where the rule of reciprocity or of retaliation will justify its use.

But Denmark has never used nor acknowldged the rule; and, therefre, we cannotju.stly entirce it ag.nst
her. But if this Court should adipt the rule, we trust it will be with the strictest limitation.

PiNKNEY, contra.

By the capture of Santa Cruz by the British, it inimediately became the colony oif an enemy. It is not necessary that the occupation should be peTetual ; for the time it ias indefinite, and during the occupation it was as much the colony of an enemy as any of his dther possessions.

If, then, Santa Cruz was an enemy's colony, its produce, while it remained the propert) .of the owner of
,th soil, was the property of an enemy. Sir W. Scott, in the case of the Phmnix, 5 Rob. 21, (Eng. Ed.) says that the rule has been so repeatedly decided both in that and the superior Court, that it is no longer open to discussion. No question can be made upon the point of law at this day.

The opposite argument goes to show that if the property in the soil be acquired before the capture of the island, the owner would not be considered an enem3 oalthough the island should remain permanently a British
colony.

The case of the Phonix contains nO exception to the

general rule; it is, however, said that the case of the

Dianashowd an exception ; but that was a mere ques-

tion of domicil. The rule now under consideration was

not discussed.

It is said that the party, in order to acquire the hos tile character as to the produce of his estate, must incorporate hitnself with the ints.rests of the ontmy while the soil is in possession of the enemy. But the rule is not so. There is no dffrence whether lie acquire the estate before or after it come into the possession of the
enemy ; if he continues to hol the estate, he becomes
immediately incorporated with the nation jure belli.

But it is asked, is Great Britain to legislate for other nations? We say no. But this Court will pay great
re.spect to the English decisions on this subject; especially as the ruk has been acquiesced in by all the nations of Eurvpe. Not one of thiem has renmonstrated-not even Dt-nmark. It has, therefore, the positive aulhority of England, and the npgative authority of all the residue.of Erope. 'l'iv rule- is not harder than that of

HARPER, lt Ireffly.,

It is said that the rule is general, because all the na-
tions of Europe have a;'quiesced in the English deci. sions. Sev-ral reasons may he given- f,.r this appear-
ance of acquiescence. It is a recent rule. Ne autho. rity can be produled for it earlier than 1783, jst at

MARSHA L, Ch. .delivered the opinion or the Court -as follows:

The island of Saita Cruz, belonging to the kingdom
of Denm~rk, was subdued, during the late %al., by the arms of his Britannic majest3. Adrian Benjamin Bentzon, an officer of the Danish government, and a proprietor of land therein, withdrelv from the island ol its surrender, and has since resid: d in Denmark. The property of the inhabitants 'bieing secured to then, lie still retained his estate in the island undcr the management of'an agent, who shipped thirty hogsheads of sugar, the produce of that estate, on board a British ship,
to a commercial house in London, on account and risk of the said A. B. Bentzon. On her passage, she was captured by the American privateer, the Comet, and brought into Baltimore, where the vessel and cargo were libelled as enemy property. A claim for these sugars was put in by Bentzon; but they were condemned with the rest of the cargo; and the sentence was affirmed in the Circuit Court. The Claimant then ap. pealed -tothi Colirt.

Some doubt has been suggested whether Saifta Cruz, while in the possession of Great Britain, could properly be considdred as a British island. But for this doubt there. can be no foundation. Although acquisitions mnade during war are not consideredl as permanent until confirmed by treaty, yet to every commercial and bel-
ligerent purpose, they are considered as a part of thedomain of the conqueror, so long as he retains the pos-
session and government of them. The island of Santa Cruz, after its'bapitulation, remained a British island until it Was restored to Denmark.

Must the produce of a plantation in that island, shipped by'the propribtor himself, who is a Dane residing in Denmark, be.considered as British, and therefore enemy property?

SUPREME COURT U. S.

30 n-ms. In arguihg this questionj the counsel for the Clat.

Or §UGAR mants has made two points.

0.

BOYLE 1. That this case does not come within the rule ap-

&OTHERS. plicable to shipments from ail enemy country, even as

-

laid down in the Blritish Courts of admiralty.

2. That the rule has not ocen rightly laid down in those Courts, and consequently will not be adopted in this.
1. Does the rule laid down in the British Courts of admiralty embrace this case?
It appears to the Court that the case of the Plienix is precisely in point. In that case a vessel was captured in a -voyage from Surinam to Holland, and a part of the cargo was claimed by persons residing in Germany, thei a neutral countryy as the produce of their estates in Surinam.

The counsel for the captors considered the law of the case as entirely settled. The counsel for the Claimants did not controvert this position. They admitted it; but endeavored to extricate their case from the general principle by giving it the protection of the treaty
of Aniens. In pronouncing his opinion, sir William Scott lays down the general rule thus: ,,Certainly ",nothing c;hn be more decided and fixed, as the princi",ple of this Court and of the Supreme Court, upon -5very solemn arguments, than that the possession of
" the soil does impress upon the owner the character of 66 the country, as far as the produce of that plantation
d is concerned, in its transportation to any other coun-
",try, whatever the local residence of the owner may 4 be. This has been so repeatedly decided, both in this " and the sop'.rior Court. that it is no longer open to ",discussion. No. question can be made oit the point of ",law, at this day."

Afterwards, in the case of the Mrrow Anna Catlarina, sir William Scott lays down the rule, and states its reason. " It canno)t be doubted," he says, "6that there are transactirns so radically and fundamentally national as to.impress the national character, independent of peace
or war. and 'the local residence of the parties. The

FE3RUARY TE1BI 18ig.
produce of' a person's own plantation in tne colony of 30 YnIDs the enemy, though shipped in time of peace, is liable to OF suoAR be considered as the property of the enemy, by reason -0. that the proprietor has incorporated hiinse" with the BoYLE ,permanent interests ofthe nation' as a holder of the soil, &OTIMUr. and is to be taken as a part of that-country, in that particular transartion, independent of his own personatresidence"and occupation."
This rule laid down with so much precision, does not, it is contended, embrace Mr. Beutzons claim,- because lie has not " incorporated himself with the perma" nent interests of the nation." He acquired the property while Santa Cruz was a Danish colony, and he withdrew from the island when it became British.
This distinction, does not appear to the Court to be a sound one. - The identification of the national character of the ovner with that orthie soil, in the particular transaction, is not placed on the dispositions'with which 1e acquires the soil, or on his general rharacter. The acquisition of land in Santa Cruz binds him, so far as respects that land, to the fate of Santa "Cruz, whatever its destiny may be. While thai island belonged to Denmark, the produce of the soil, while unsold, wa, according to this rule, Danish property, whatever might be the general- character of the particular proprietor. When the island became British, the soil and its produce, whilethat produce remained unsold, were British.
The general commercial or political character of Mr. Bentzon could not, according to this rule, affect this particular transaction. Although incorporated, so far as respects his gc.neral character, with the permanent interests of D.-umark, he was incorporated, so far as respected his plantation -in Santa Cruz, with the permanent interests of Santa Cruz, which was, at that time, IBritish ; and though as a Dane, he was at war with Great Brita.n, and an enemy, yet, as a proprietor of land in Santa Cruz, lie was no enemy : lie could ship his produce to Great Britain in perfect safety.
The case is certainly within the rule as laid down hi the British Courts. The next enquiry is: how far will that rule be adopted in this country ?

SUP.REME COURT U. S.

SO u.DS. The law ofnations is thegreat source from which we deOF SIT6AR rive tho5e rule., respedtingbelligereut and neutral rignts
whichaae recognized by All civilized and connerciia no-irB , states throughout Europe and America. This law is in &OTFERS.. partiunwlsitten, and in part conventional. To ascertain
that which is uiwritten, we resort to the great princi*pies of reason and justice: but, as these. principles will be differently understoqd by. liffiet'ent nations'unfler dif-
ferent circumstances, we cQnsider them as being. in some. .degree, fixed and rendered stable by a series of judi-
cial decisions. . The, decisions of the Courts of- very country, so far as they are founded upon a law conmmon
to every country, will be rcceivd, not as authority, but with respect. The decisions' of the .Conrts of every cowitry show how the law of ,ati,,n, in the given case,
is und.rstood in that country. and will be. considered in
adoptin.- the rule which is to prevail in this.

Without taking a comparative view of the justice or, fairness of the rules established in the British Courts,
and of tbiose~estiblishied in the Courts of other nations, there are circumstances not to be excluded from con-
sideration, whirh give to those rules a claim to our attention that wo cannot entirely disregard. The United States havin.g, at one time, -forned a component part of the British empire, their prize law was our prize law. When we sepairated, it continued to be our prize law,
so far as it was adapted to our circumstances And was
not varied by the power which was capable of changing it.

Itwill not be advanced, in cnsequence of' this former relation between the two countries, that any obvious iniscotistructiou of public law made by the' British Courts. will be corlsidered as forming a rule' for the American Courts, or that any recent rule of the British Co rtsis entitled to more respect then the recent rdes of other countries. Buf a case professing to be decided on ancient prificiples will not be entirely disregarded, uiess it be very unreasonable, or be founded on a construction rejected by other nations.
The rule laid down in the Phmnix is said to be a recent rule, because a case solemnly decided before the lords bommissioners.in 17'831 is quoted ii the margin

ing it to be contary to the rute of other nations ift a noTE-

similar case.

&OT~n.s.

The opinion that ownership of the.soil does, ip some degree, connect the owner with the property, so far as respects that soil, is an opinion wiich certainly.pre.vails very extensively. It. is not an unrc asonable opinion. Personal plioperty miy follbw the person any where; and its character, if found on the ocean, may depend on the domicil of the &(kn.er. But land is fixed. Wherever the ow-her may reside, that land is hostile or friendly arcording to the condition of the country in which it i.; placed. It is no extravagant perversion of principle,'nor is it a vilent offience to the course of human *opinien to say that the proprietor, so far as
respects his interest in this land, partakes of its character; and that the produce, %%hilethe owner r-mains unchanged, is stihject to the same disabilities. Inrondemning the sugars of M r. Uentzon as enemy property,
this Court is of opinion that there was no error, and the
sentence is affirmed with costs.

irrremf-d.

The Hazard was captured in December, 1813, about 6 miles from the land of Amelia Island, by a boat from the United States Flotilla, and carried into St. Mary's, in Georgia. The boarding officer, after examining the ship's papers, returned them to the captain, and asked the captain's permission to stay on board -that night, which was granted ; and at the request of the captain. the boarding officer assisted in piloting the ship over the bar of St. Mary's river, and brought her to anchor, after which he asked again for the ship's papers and then declared his intention to take the ship to St. Mlary's. The captain in his protest states that the ship anchored nearer to the Spanish shore and harbour than to any other. The cargo was claimed in behalf of Luning, Gogel Co. of Gottenburg.
CHAALTON and P. B. KIn,_for the .ppelans, contended,
1. That in as much as RusSia and the United States, had both adopted the'principles of the armed neutrality, the principle, that free ships should make free groods, was, as between those two nations, to be considered as, part of the law of nations,.and that the cargo was protected by the Russian flag.'

LIVINGSTON.. J. delivered the opinion of the Court as UA zAAD

follows:

T.

.The ship Hazard and cargo were libelled as prize of &oTnuns. war in the District Court of Georgia,- where the latter was condemned, and the ship restored to the master with
an alowance for freight. This sentence being aflirmed by the Circuit Court, an appeal as to the cargo was taken to this Court.

The cargo was claimed in behalf -of Mesqrs. Luning, Gogel & Co. pobjects of Sweden, and residing at Gittenburg. It is impossible to look at the,proofs in this cause, without being at once convinced that this huse never had any intrest in it. The papers found on board leave. not the smallest doubt as to the hostile character of the property, which is also abundantly proved by the witne.ses who were examined in the district Court. The ship-
.-ment was made by Mr. Worrall) a British merchant at Liverpool, and an Enish pupercargo put on hoard by the name of Diggles. under whom Mr. Dalmer, who filed
the claimi was to act as assistant supercargo. Between Mr. Warral! and AMr. Lowden, who makes sonic figure
in this transaction, there is proved to esist such an intimate connexion as to render the one chargeable for' the declaratious aud acts of the other, so far as they regard this shipment. Mr. Lowden, in a letter to his correspondent at Charleston, which was on board of the Haz-
ard. says- There is likely to be a great dql of business
"cdone betwixt this and Amelia lslan;d.' The vessel that "Otis goes by has about 90001. worth on hoard. The ",parties interested are mq pa.ticular friends." And a little further. on- It may perhaps be satisractory ta
"know that we have fil and unlimited authority froln "a respectable house in Gottenburg. to make use of ",their name upon any occasion whatever ; so that, in " case of capture or detention, the necessary pro ,f could "easily be p oduced of the neutrality of the property." Mr. Worrall writes to Mr. Smith. of Charleston. that - the Russian vessel Hazard, bound to Amelia Island,
"was laden by him in codji.nction 'with somne other dfriends." There was. also, a mnemoi'andum on board
for the government of the "sipurcargorsigned by Low-

flAZARD "you must uniformly declare the property to belong to V. "Luning, Gogel & Co:of Gottf nburg, as it is 'represent-
cOi fuELL "ed to be by the documents accompanying the cargo. &OTHERS. "Men of war are alit to board under false colors, and
,, if you dont stick to the text, you may be deceived." It
may be asked here, why was the supercargo thus cautioned to be on his guard, unless he-was in the secret, as he doubtless was, that the docunients were colorable, and the property ni fact British ?

Mr. Dalmer,, in the claim interposed by him for the
car.go, does not swear to its neutrality, but only that the gentlemen at Gottenburg are owners thereof, as far'as he is informed ; and it is deserving of attention that Mr. Diggles, the supercargo,, not only does not unite wiLh the assistant supercargo in filing this claim, but, on being, brought before the commissioners, refusesAo be swo'n or examined as a witness in the cause. On his examination, sometime afterwards, before the district judge, he states
that "h e is not acquainted with the owners of the cargo
,, or any part of it, and cannot swear that Luning, Go"gel & Co. are the-owners : that he received his instruc-
" tions from Mr. Worrall as agent of that house."

There was a short-letter of instructions on board, to Oiggles and Dalmer, dated 8th October, i813, and pro-
ved.to be signed by Luning, Gogel & Co. but the body of which must, no doubt, have been written by Mr. Worrail; or under his direction.

Now although the'invoice be made out in the name and for the account and risk of Luning, Gogel & Co. and a letter of instructions signed by them was found on board, it would be giving more weight to these formal documents than they are entitled to, should we say, that they have satisfied us, nntwithstanding the mass of evi-
denc6 which this cause presents to the contrary, that the property was other than British through every stage of
this transaction. Indeed, the advocates of the Appel-
lant, despairing to convince the Court of its ne,:trality, rely principally on an irregularity in the capture, and on a suppression'by the captors'of aletter of instructions

IIAZAJID
The capture it is alleged was made within the limits v. andjurisdiction of Spain. Of this there- is no sufficient cAurnwz evidence, which renders it unnecessary to say what influ- &oTnRts. ence that fact, if established, might have on thq ultimate decision of the Court. The suppression of the paper in question is also very imperfectly made out; and if it had been brought into Court and formed part of the evidence

in: the cause, it could not possibl& do the Appellant afly
good; ,for a paper ierely signed by Luning, Gogel & Co. and converted into a letter of instructions by Mr. Worrall, in Liverpool, td suit his own purposes, as must

have been the case here, could Eave but liftle effect ill removing any one of the. niumerous doubts which the citcumstances of this case are so well ca1culated to excite.

A motion has also been made for an order ror further proof. If the Court entertained any difficulty as to the reality (if this transaction, or believeettliat Messrs. Luning, Gogel & Co. could prove that they were, in fact; the owners of this property, perhaps itmight listen to the application late as it is; but believing, as it does, that the evidence, as it now stands, is not susceptible of any satisfactory explanation, and that the captors havL made out a clear title to the whole cargo shipped by Mr.,
Woyral, it cannot, in justice to them, make any such
order.

,The sent~nce of the Circuit Court is, therefore, unanimously affirmed with costs.

The 'laim under an improvement being of soperior dignity to that of Charhis Simms, hiis title. must yield to that of the Defendants in error, if theirs be free from

Th land law of Virginia, under whihi all parties

The sitoation of Kentucky, covered with conflicting titles to lanrd, has made it necessary that this requisftjon of tliv law should be enforced with some degree of rigor, whil, the ignorance of early lorators, the dangers to
wl i'hi they were. exposed, and the. difficulty of deseri. bin, with absolute precision, lands which were held by a very slight improvement made on a single spot, and which civild not be.immediately surveyetd, induced the
Courts 9f that country, for the pprpose of preserving entries as far as was consistont with law, to frame corA111n general rules Of very extensive application to cases which occurred. One was, that the designation of any

The Court below was of opinion that there was suf.. Kcient certainty in the certificate of Sohn Ash, sour. and in the entry afterwards made with the surveyor by Terrell ard Hawkins; that the improvement intentled to be claimed by Ash was that which he won of Al'Collore. and that the land should be surveyed in a square form with the lines to the cardinal points, icludinq the improvement won of MCollum in the ceitre. A survey havinjg been made. in conformity with this interlocutory decree, the Court ordered thn Defendant below to convey severally to the Plaintiffs in that Court so much -of the land claimed by them as was included in his patent. To this decree Charles Simms has sued out a writ of error.
SwA.x, for the rPlintiff'in error, contended,
1. That Simms having the first entiy -anti first patent and judgment at law in ejectment, his title must' prevail.
The entry of Terrell and Hawkins in i7Si cannot be rconnected with the settlement of Ash. It does npt refer to it, and the want of such reference cannot be aid·ed by any extrinsic evidene. The entry must be in its,-If sufftiient, or it can avail nothing. Harding'sReports, 108, Patterson'sdertsees -o.Bradford.
2. The entry, if it can be connected with the certificate of the commissioners in favor of Ash, is still void for uncertainty. There were two settlements by Ash, and it does not appear to which the coimmissioners alluded; or if it doos appear to which they alluded, it was to the first settlement of Aqh, and not to that vhiich was begn by M-C.olloni.

1. The first objection is, that the right of pre-.motion never bonged to this land, because it is said that Simms had a prior claim.

But the act only excldes from the ri.ht of pro.emp-
tioh, lands to 'which a k.at title had been acquired prior to the date of the act. The law refers back to the
improvement, and .gives the pre-emption, notwitlistandin.; an intermediate, title. - Simms must show .that his title conmenWed before the passing of the land law

2. The second objection relates to the vagueness of theentry.

The entry of Terrell and Hawkins was made upon warrant No. 1226, and refers to it, That warrant was
lodged with the surveyor, and refers to the pre-emption certificate of Ash.

The cases cited to show that you cannot make a
vague entry certain by reference to another paper, are of recent date, and if they are t6 be understood as tho
opposite counsel contends. wouhl be in opposition to the
analagous cases, in the case of Patlerson's devsees V. a'rafo, harding..108, it is said .that if the entry calls
for an improvement you may refer to the certificate to show where. the improvement was. So ih Grenmup x,. 1cnto4, Hkarding, 16, the Court decided that you might refer to another 1}apcr to show what was ambiguous in the entry.

It is-aso sail that it appears by extraneous e idenco
that there were two improveihents by Ash, and therefore that tl entry is uncertain.,

The qnestin is whether the improvement was s iill-
ciently notorious to give notice to-subsequent locators. It might have been as nothrions as any other object. 'rhe
cabin, the spring.' the ruf.and the location of Joseph Con were all well known. But it is in proof tht one
of the improvements.was abandone:l. They were nrar each other and formed only one plantation or settlem-nt. The evidence is that Ash!s improvement means ths cabin where his widow now lives.

The pre-emption ofAsh ought to be laid off from Lis first improvement. Ash renewed both imprbv nients, viz. .8sh's and .Clon's, as suick. The question is, which was Ash's settlen eni at the time referred to in the ceriificate of The Court of cordmisioners? What did lie mark and inmprve in the 3 car 1776 ? It is the improvement mjae in 1776 only to which the con.missioners refer. The cabin was built after the certificate.

MAnsu u., Ch. J. after stating the facts of the case, delivered the opinion of the Court as follows:
The first error assigned is that the'entry and survey of the Plaintiff in error being prioi- to the claidi made by Ash before the C6urt of commissioners, gave him a legal right to the land so entered and suveyed, not to bec affected by the subsequent claim of Ash.

The words of the act of assembly are, , That all "those who, before the said first day of January, 1778,
"had marked out orL chosen ror themselves any wasto "or unappropriated lands, and built any house or hut, "or made other, improvemenTs thereon, shall also bo '.entitled, on the like terms, to ay quantity of lanl, to "6include such improvement, not exceedingi ,000 acres,
e6nd to which no other person bath any legal right or ds claim;"

The Court is clearly of opinion that the words of the law refer to the time when the.improvement was :nade, aid to the.time of the passage of the iit; not to tho time when the claim, foun led on that inmprownient, was made to the Court of cofnmissioner.s. If the land, when imj'roved, was waste and unappropriated, i, at the passage of the act, no other person had s any. legatl
right or claim" to the land in improved, such right could not be atquired uqtil tmiat of the improver should helost.

The second error i,; that the entry made by Terrell and Hawkins with the surveyor has no reference to the

SUPREME COURT V. S.

simms pre-emption certificate of Ash, and is therefore not a v. gbod and valid entry of Ash's pre-emption right.

GUTURrE

& AL.

Terrell and Hawkins were assignees of Ash; and this ought to have. been expressed in the entry. Those words are omitted. In con.sequence (if theiir omission, it does not appear whose improvement is to be incluied.

Upon this point the Court has felt a good deal of difficulty. If the entry with the surveyor couhl be connected with the certificate of the commissioners, this difficulty would be entirely romoved. But the Court is not satisfied tk.nt, according to the corso of decisions in Kentucky, such reference is allowablb.

The Coutt, however, is rather inclined to sustain the location, because its terms are such as to sugg .t" to any subsequent locator the nature of the omission which had been made.

Terrell and Hawkins enter 1,000 acres of land, "to include his improvement." It was then a warrant founded on an improvement; and that improvemnent was made, not by them, but by a single person. Of that single person 'Terrell and Hawkins were, of course, the assigneeq. The. place was described with such (ertainty as would have b"en'suflieient, had the assignment been stated. On coming to the place, Ash's improvement would have been found. The mistake, therefore, does not mislead subsequent locators. It does riot pioint to a different place. They are as well inforniad as they would have been by the insertion of the omitted words. Tho entry, to6, contains a reference to the waterant which the, law directed to be lodged with he surveyor, and t remain there until it should be retutned with the plht and certificate of survey to the land office.

S. It is also objected that some of the. Defendants in error do riot show a complete legal title under ''errell and Hawkins, for which reason they have not entitled themselves to a conveyance from .Chavl's Simns ; and that one of them, John AMei-,,;s, has obtained a decree f. 1i-0 acres of land, although in the bill he claimed only io acres.

FEBRUARY TERM i8s15.

Regularly the Claimants who have only an equitable
title ought to make those whose, title, they assert, as well as the person from whom they claim a conveyance, parties to the suit. For omitting to do s,) an original
bill might be dismissed. But this is a bill to enjoin a judgment at law rendered for the Defendant in equity
against the Plaiutiffi. The bill must be brodght in the Court of the United. States, the judgment having been rendered in that Court. Its limited jurisdiction might possibly create some doubts ifthe propriety of making
citizens of the same state with the Plaintiffi, parties De-
fendants. In such a case, the Court may dispense. with
pat-ties who would otherwise be require(d, and decree as between those before the Court, since its decree cannot affect those who are not parties to the suit.

srflzs T.
GUTniU.
& AL. --

It is certainly a correct principle.that the Court cannot decrei to any Plaintiff, whatever he niny prove, more than he claims in his bill. Nothing further is in issue between the parties. It is not nece sary to inquire whether any thing appears in this cause, which
can prevent the Plaintiff from availing hims.lf of this principle; because the decree will be opened on another
point, in consequence of which -this objection wilt probably be removed.

4. The fourth error is that John Ash having two improvements, it is uncertain which he claimed bWfore the commissioners, and his entry is on this account void; or if not so, then his claim was for the improvement made by himself, and not for that won from BM'Colom.

It is admitted that if the terms of the entry are such as to leave Ash at liberty to select either improvement,. it is void; and that if the terms. of the entry confine him to either, he must abide by his oiiginal election.

Upon considering the testimony on this point, the Court is of opinion that the entry may be construed to refer to one improvement in exclhsion of the other; but
that the improvement referred to is the one first made
by himself.

Let the several members of this description be examined. VOL. IX.

An important questin in this case is, what is to be- T1I come of the American part of the cargo of an armed scnooNt American vessel, re-captured by an American private ADnLUMr. armed vessel.?

The re-captorsin the first place contend that the part of the cargo above menttoned is casLs oinissus as to the act of congress of thq 3d of .March,1800.

If the Court should decide that there Is a casus omissus then the fate of this part of the cargo will depend upon the common law.

The re-captors contend that the common law is that if property so situated has remained twenty-four lhoto-
in possession of the enemy of the captured party, they are entitled to the whole of the property as prize of war. To this they cite Grotius de jure beUi ac jacis, lib. 3,ek. 16. Vatt. boo" ', chi. IS, §* 196. This right upon re-
capture is here clearly laid down to privateers to be. divested only bythe laws of each state and treaties. Our treaty with France is silent except as to restoration on
capture by pirates ; this being ex deticto there is no
change of property by the original capture. Se6 -d.so professor Marten's summary of the law of natio:ns, book VI1, ch. 3, § 10. - In ord:.r to encouragpe privateering
6s those concerned in it are allowed to hold all the mer-
"cchant vessels and merchandize they take from the "enemy or his subjects without any reserve whatsoever
,with respect to the redemption of them by the pro.
*"prietor."

The ouly remaining question on this point would. be w,hat kind of possession consummates the right- of the privateer. Twenty-four hours possession has ben coisidered ,,firm" possession. and sufficient to consnminate this right by an almost common usage, and relognized by almost all the treaties of maritime powers. i Rab. 151, .Amer. ed. 2 Azuni, 306, 308, 312, in a note 275,

ADELINE.. at cOmnm6'law, and the doctrine of taking away that

right by salvage is derogatory to, that law. If this b6

so, the act of congress is derogatory to the common law,

and must be lioeratly construedinfa;orof privateers.

The reward has always been out of the whole suliject matter; the cargo as well as vessel and armament; and it is with confidence contended that a separation. of the ca;go so as to subject it to one sixth salvage, while the
vessel 'and armanent rffords one half, is, ifit exist at all, anomalous to the act of the- 3d of March, 18Q0, and at war with the usage and treaties of all mariime states.

The reas6n of encreasing the salvage, upon an armed vessel is the merit of bUtte, and it is evident that th carg, is as weil won by battle as the. armament and vessel.

,Bit'iftlie.whole of tire Act of congress he/to be taken together, and the ,td section le permitted to reflect a light upon the 1st section, it will appear that coi:gress could
have had no other meaning than that the Isalvage should
be'increased upon the rargo s well as the vessel and armament. In the.second 'section. where'they give a salvageulmn thecir owt\ prperty thus captured by a private armed vessel, they give one half of thegoods on board as well as of the vessel and armament.

But should not time cargo be considered as a mere incident to the vessel and follow its fate and character ?'

admits the twenty-four hojar rile, but excludes its application to that case, that being the case of a neutral capture ' hich convoyed no right. See also the case of the .Mary FPrd, S Dal. 188, At,Donough -c.Dannery.

On the right of the re-captors on the 4th point of the case theN will not enlarge by -argument, as they consider it well established ; fior on that of the 5th point than merely to observe that it appears to be just, ex izecessi. tate, and-comes under the description of confusion inthe civil law; nor as to the -6th point than to observe that
there isno standard -by which a character can be reflected opon these Claimants but the Toyige.itself; which makes them either Anierican or Frmnch. The -de~cripfion of the claim negatives the idea of their being American ; they must, of course, be French. The 7th point must meet the same construction for the same reason.

As to the principle contended for in lhe 8th point of
he case, it may be remarked, for elucidation, that some -ofthe Claimants, descnibed as in this point turn out, by
the evidence, to be residentin France for commercial purposes.

Is the owner of the vessel entitled to freight exclusiwq of salvage?

The re-captors say the vessel is not entitled to f,-eight because she 'would have been condemned hnd she been bi'ought into England. But if entitled to fi'tight, the ,captors have saced that freighbt, and are therefore enti. tIed to one half as salvage.* Freight may remain, after
all the rights of the captors are deducted, to be adjusted between the vessel and the freighters.

This question can only apply to the American part of the cargo ; for as to the.French, the rule is to vest the

property absolutely in cases. of re-capture after £iwenty-

four h6urs possession : the postliminii right and all its

incidents are destroyed.

SUPREME COURT U. S.

THE IRVING, in behaLf of the owners of the essel, and of ScHOONEn such'parts of the cargo as "wereclaimed by personsresde[t APELINE. in the United States.

The schooner Adeline is a registered American vessel owned by IsAac Levis and William Weaver. nativo citizn4 of the United States, and residetits of PI iladelphin, and was commissioned as *anAmerican letter of marque. Shxe commnenced her voyage from Bordeaux, to a port in the United States, in the month of Marcb,'181t, having on board a cargo owned principally by, citizens of the United States and others residing in our territory. In th6 course of this voyage, she *as first captured by two British vessels of war, and was afterwards, tnd before
her condemnation as Prize, re-captured by an American private armed vessel. Upon her first capture, most of
her papers were taken from on board by the captors, and thost, which were loft have been delivered up to the
district Court at New York, and transcripts of the same
are contained in the record before this Court.

In these cases most of tile claims and test aila. vits sp. cify the property respectively claimed, at the
'time of shipment in the Adelino, and at the time of capthri, to have been owned'by citizens and residents in the United States.

Many of tOme claims and test affldiivits testify that the goodls Ihus clammed vested in the Claimants before and at
Oe time of capture and re capturo; and generally all the claims are supmorted b) the respec.tive bills of lading. In truth th re is not a papi r attachd to this record which falsifies any cl~im or casts any suspicion upon them. An objection has been taken to some of those claims, becausQ they do not state that the property vested in the Claimants at thetime of shipm-nt, and that, for aught that appears to this Court, the property might have been transferred in transitu.

Admitting this to be the fact, how c 'n such transfer prejudice those Claimants ? Time vessel was an Ameri., cai, vessel coming from a Frenchport to a port of the United States.

But the claims objected to will be found, on examination, to agree with those which are in common use in the admiralty Courts of England, even in cases where the property is captured as prize of war. The Fortuna, 2 Rob. in the appendix. Si3. It is sufficiept to assert property in the 'Claimants and to negative the all, gation of title in the enemy at the time.of capture. .Those clai'iis and test affidavits are testimony in a prize cause, and will be deemed satisfactory, unless there is s,)ne evidence in the ship's papers or preparatory examinations to in-
validate them. See the duke of .N'ewcastle'sletter in the
appendix to Chitty. 6 Rob. 55, the Haabet.

But to proceed to the merits of this case. Upon examining thelibel of the captors, the first enquiry %%il;be, whether this property coadd be capturedas "prie,for it has been so libelled.

The commission to our private armed vessels, under the act deplaring war, authorizes the re-taking of property captured which was originally American. The property thusre-taken can only present a case of salvage, because the title of the origiad proprietors never has been divested ; and that equally' whether the property was originally American or neutt-al.

The interest of the captured property does not vest in the captor until after final adjudication. 5 Rob. 167, Ahm. Edit. the Elsebe----,sect. prz=e act, 11th 'ont. Uuited States laws. And thefifth section of the prize art pro-

competent jurisdiction, according to the, nature of each case, agreeably to the provisions heretofore established by law."
-The present case, then, before the Cnort determines itself to be a case of sal, age, if there was a right to re. capture,-and ifthe Rervice rendered was meritorious. The right is pt qyestioned, for the re-capture was from the 2n6my ;.nor is' the service questioned, for the property would have beei otherwise lost.
It becomes however a matter of enquily, whether the re-captdrs tnder their present libel can have a decree for salvage. The phpers taken frotn on board the vessel and the examinations in preparatorioproved that the recaptured vessl- was an American vessel, and that her cargo was in part American and in part French. It was evident, therefore, that the re-capture mbuld only present 9 ease of salvage; and as such the vessel 'and cargo should haVe been libelled. 1 ut the libell'ants have 'proceed.'d against the property as prize of-war, and have aserted title to it as such.in all their allegations. Uust they not mtke out those allegations, and) if theyail, can they,.as a Iast resort, seek for salvage, when such has not bten prayed foi' in their libel, nor in any manner spread upon the record before this Court?
But if the Court should be of opinion tllat a decree for salvage can be made upon the libel, clanis and disclosures in this record, then the only question will'be the. amount of this salvage. The re-captors contend for a moiety, and we, that they should have but a sxth. Which is right must depend upon a just constrtuotion of the act in cases of re-, apture, passed 3d .Xarch, 1800, 5 Vol. U. $tates lazesy P&t Grtqdon, 118.
T~Ihe first branch of the first sectioii of tlis act provides that, "a re-raptu red- vesselyother than a vessel-of war or f' tearmed vessel, shall be restofed, on ~payrnent of o ne ¢ighth, (iftaken by a public armed vessel,) of the v tie of ihe ke-ciptnired vessel and cargQ; and it re-taken by a'private armed veselpof one sixtli," '

The second branch of that section provides '"that if TIM

The law having settled the amount the Court when it ascert-hi whtit thb law L9. will adhere to the provision. Now the construction must depend on the evident nicaning and intent of the legisl,ture, as clearly to he gathered from j yiew'uf the whole pFoyision ; and it may Ve adopted as a fundamental rule,. that where there is an express ]provision, -there shall not be a provision by implicatign ; expyiessio uiusoestexcu,sio alferus,

suited. I grant it, .wherever there is any ambigeity in a statute. In such case it isthe privilege and 'duty of the Court to' give a just construction. But this'only holds in *cases where there is great obscurity, not in cases where the provisions of the statute are clear and.explicit. To hold that a Court can intermeddle with such pravisions is to.clothe the Court with" legislative as well asjudicial powers-to 'authorize it to niake laws instead of only expounding them.

But tl~e first and second sections of this statute are -wholly independent. The first relates to the re-capture of privateproperty either by.our public or private armed vessels. The second: relates t9 the re-capture of public

property either by our public or private armed vessels. Each-section is perfect in itself, and each independent of

the other; .neither requires the interposition of any

Court to explain them.

,,Wherever any words of a statute are, obscure or dotibtful, the intention of the legislature is to be reorted to in orderto find the meaning ofr the words." Plowden
57, Wiibimh v. Tadbois.

Where words of a statute are plain and positive, it is not the province of the Court to search after new consfructions.

Justice Buller remarks in the case of Bradley cy ano-' ther v. Clark, s T. R. 201. ' that, with regard to the construction of statutes according to the intention of the legislature, we must remember, that there is an essential fifferencle between the expqunding of modern and ancient
apts of parliament., In early times the legislature used to pass laws in general and in few terms; they were left to the -Courts of law to be construed, so as tb reach all
the cases within the 'misliief to be remedied. But in modern times, great car has be.n taken to montion the particular cases inithe contemplation of the legislature, ind therefore the Cnirts are not permitted to take the same liberty in construing themn as they did in expoundipg the ancient statutes."

But the provisions in this statute respecting salvage were n)t unadvised provisions hurr'edover without deliberation. Chngress, in consequence of the partial v = with France, had been called on to legislate repeatedly upon the subject.

The first provision was by statute 28th Jutn, i798, N vcol. United States laws, p. i5b, sect. 2d. This is gen-

SUPREME COURT ,U. S.

U)BLINE.

The second provision was by 'statute of,March -2d 1709, Ith vol. United States laws, p. 172. That gives,. (if detained 24 hours,) one eighth ; if 48 ours, one fifth ; if 96 hours, one half-; without any distifictibn between vessel ind goods, oi' 1irMet anil unarmed.

Tfi'enext yeai', induced by the inconvenience or ine.
juaity of the former laws, they made a deliberate provision. The subject was fresh; every clause was aveighed. Those provisbns had ben. a matter of investiga. tion f6r three successive sessions of congres, and had been successivcly amended. Can it be saiO, then, thht eongresg had not a view of the whole ground, that they
werehurried in.thepasing of this law. The very law they were considering was an amendment, and would naturally cause enquiry and eflection.

In mature deliberation, therefore, they, in theyeari8oo, evact the ireseat law. They discriminate between private 'unarnied Vessels and goods, allowing one sixth for salvage, and for the vessel alone, if armed, a nioiety. The r4captured propeityof the United States is placed in a distinct section, wholly unconnected with the other,

If we attend to the language of thelast clause of the Arst sectiot, giving-to .therecaptors the moiety ofa,priVate armed "ves.se, we shall ascertain the reason why a grvater salvage was given for the vessel-than the gctods.

home? Were they not then in fact more d-stit-,te of a navy than at present'? In pursuance of thi-r argument of extrabrdinary :nerit upmi the present occasion, it has ben ured-that the re-captured vessel was armed ; and
that life was hazarded equally in re-rapt ring the goods a in re-capturing the vessel. In tMe present ins!anco it is idle to talk of danger ; the Adeline from her arma ment was incapable of making resistance, and whether she did or not is problematical, as from the preparatory examinations there appear to be an uncertainty whether arly resistance was'attempted. It is, however, certain that the resistance, if any, was a mere parade; .Ind that having"fired one or twoguns, the vessel instantly surrendered. Not a soul was hurt on either side, and the privateer did not deem the resistance sufficiently important to return.

--But admitting that the service, by any chance, might
have been very nmeritorious ; that great gallantty might have been displayed and many lives lost; yet under this statute. I know not how ny Court can interfere with its settled provisions.

In the case of the Apollo, 3 Rob. q5O, which vessel was cut out from under fie. guns of a French fortress, where much daring spirit was evidenced on the part of the re-captors, and much danger hazardod, and whera extraordinapy salvage was applied for, Sir William

A claim has also been int'rposedbythe ownbrs of the schooner Adeline l;r freigbt and primago of that part
of the cargo which inot owhied by them1 That such should be allowed I would respectfully contend there
can he no question, as the voyage has bern performedl, and the ear o delivered at its port of destination. But the re.captors assert that they are.entitled to a salvage of this freight. On the part of the owners, this is opposed ; first, because salvage of the freight is not given by the statute. and, second, because it is in fact alloVod iii the value of the goods.

The act has prescribed the terms on which the vessel and goods are to lie restored. The- Court cannot add to those terms. The re-captors have no means of procuring this salvage except by witholding tile goods ; iut the act declares that the goods shall he given up, upon payment of one sixth of their value, without nmakin i any provision for salvage of freight Againit whorn could
thb d;,crce for a salvage ofthe freight lie ? Not against the goods. fir they are delivered up; not against the owners of the goods, for they are thot before tile Court.

But salvage of fr'eight is in fact paid in the increased value of the goods. The presumption is that the merchandize is enhalnced that value by the importation. Now tile salvage is not on the invoice vah, but on the true valte of the gnods. This valu6 is rtscertained by sale or appraisement at the place where-the property iq brought ; .no deduction iq made except imports-and duties. Besides, the re-captors should not claim an addi. tionrd recompense for perlfcting that without which they c4uld not participate in tie cargoa The brlinging
,this pri.p.rty safely in entitles th-.m to the oie sixtll of its-value, mid that alone is specified in the statuteas their reward.

The district Court, from whinsedecision the re-captorm

In this decree the Claimants ofthat description acquiesced.
The re-captors have by successive appeals brought this case -befoie this Court. rIhe funds arising from a sale of this property, which sale took place belbro the aecision ',fthe district Court, have been lying iMnproductive in the last mentioned Court ever since. If tlis'Court should affirm the decree o the Circuit Court in the above mentioned cases. then those Claimants pray thatcosts and damages may be awarded them.
D. B.-OGDEN, for aft the Claimants.
This vessel qnd car'go were re-captured by the Lxpedition from the English, who had captured her, on a voyage from Bordeaux to New York. The Adeline is American property, and her cargo part of it American, part French.
The Adeline and cargo are libelled asenemiy's property, and the libel prays that they may be condemnt d as such. The clainis deny the fact of its being enemy's property, and aver that in some cases it is American property, in others that it is the vronertv of alien friends.
Before I consider the questions raised by the captors, I must first bpgle.aie to call the attention of the 'Court to some observations upon the nature of this cause as it apvears from the libel, claims and evidence.
Tie libel charges the property as being enemy's, and prays fo' its condemnation as such., The claim denies the fzct of enemy's property, and avers that it is American or the property of alien friends.
It is evident that the only point in issue, the only question arising between these parties upon the claim aud libel, is whether this property be or be not enemy's, mid as such liable to condemnation ?
j-n all cases of prize there must be a regzlae'judicial

All regular judicial proceedings consist of the proofs and allegations of the partics. I he iilhegations of the partit s are first made. and then the prooli are produ'ed' to support them. I undt-istand the rule to be univeisal ini all Courts in which there are regular judicial pr:'ceedihgs, that as a party cannot recover upon allegations ii ithout proof, so n-itht'r can he recover upon proot)s without pro. per allegations. The judgment of the Court must be according to the proofs and allegations.
What are the allegations of the parties in this case?
The libel is in the nature of a declaration in a common law Court, or of a bill of complaint in a Court of equity. It must state sufficient facts fur conilenliation, with sufficient certainty, and conclude vith a proper and sufficient prayer. It must apprize the person claiming the property libelled of"the grounds upon which a eondemnhition will be Asked, otherwise it would be more that) useless to require a libel at all.
Now this libel alleges or charges that this is enemy's property, and asks for a condemnation of it as such.
Unless the evidence in the cause proves it to be enemy's property, I apprehend the Court never %yill,under this libel, condemn it.
The idocuments on board the captured vessel, and all tie exaininotians in preparaforio, so far from proving the prikpi*rt to he enemy's property, prove directly the reverse ; anat indeed it is not pretended by the counsel for the captors that there is the least ground to suspect the property or any part of it to be hostile,
Can the captors have a decree for salvage in this case? I th k not, because they do not ask for it in their libel ; because the question here is not whether the captors are entitled to salvage or'not, but whether this is enemy'a

property or not? 1 do not believe a single case can be Tat prodaced in the books where salvage has btm, decrt'ed scuooNrE
unless it was specially asked for by the libel. A libel, like AU.nL IE a declaration, may contain several grrcuds of a decree,
or, to speak in common law lauguagr, several counts: AnI there must be a count for sahage. or it cannot be decreed.

In Hafl' A.Odmiralty practice, 144, will he found a precedent ofa libel where salvage is claimed, drawn by one 'f the most learned and experienced lawyers, partitcu-
larly as'a civilian, in the United States; which, although no authority, will certainly be cohsidered as etititled to some weight, as shewing the opinion of an enlightened
awyer upon the subject.

It is -no answer to this argument to say that where property has been libelled as prize, property of friends is freqnently condemned up( n the ground of rtesidenco in an enemy's country or tr,di,.g with an one y, be-
caus, suc'h property is conside. ed, guaadhce, as enenlmy's property., abd therefore comes within the allegation of enemy's property in the libel.

If I am right in the arganent upon this subject, thl I think it follows of course that if this is not enemy's property it cannot be condemned to the captors, but
must be wholl. restored to the Claimants without any salvage whatever. It is no hardship to the captors to acquit the property ; they knew the facts-when they filed their libel-; they made their election in what way to pro-
ceed against it; and, like all other parties in a Court of
justice, they must be bound by that election.

This, being property re-c.aptured from the enemy, imust be considered, pritircfaie,notasenemny's property.
It cannot be presumed that they would capture their own, property..

Now property re-capturnd from an enemy never canbe proceeded against as prize- of war,; it i. not considered
as enemy's property until, in som6 countries, it has been carried infra presidia; in others, has been twenty-fiur

I have already. endeavored to shew dat the capiors have no" claim to the.property ; it folloNss, then, tlhat the Court will. restore it to the lirol e oulners at the time of the decree. Suppose, howe'er, that 1 am vrung in the pi'nciples'wshich I have endeavored to establish. and that the captors .can have a decree in their favor in this case ; let me enq'uire whether the claims above alluded to are not sufficient ? All that is, necessary for the claim is to deny the material allegations in the libel. T he allegation here is that the property is enemy's propt rty, awil us such liable to be condemued. This allegation is expressly denied by the claim. Nothing more is eveV required in a claim.
"Where there are any circumstances which raise a presumption that the property is' etuemy's, such as coming fromi an Pu in) '19 port, foljnd on board an einy, vessel, &r. &c. then it becomes nece;ssary for the Claimant to explain away thosi, circumstances, to prove tho friendly nature of the prolprty, t) shew it to lve been
friendly at the time uI it; shipment. &c. which 'is done
in what is called , the test qffldarit," not in the claim.
But in' cases where the property, from the circumstan. ces of tho cese. must i. ce-sarily he presuned to belong: to our own citizens or o,r friends, (as in the case (f a
re-c:pture) then no test aff'davizt canbe necessary.; then no explanation is asled, because none is required.

If these claims are insufficient, does it follow that this TE

property must be condemned?

The claims being insuffirient, the Court will eitOi~r -sui.r the. Claimants to amend them, or they will consider them as nio claims, and dispose of the propertyaccordingly.

if an amendment is allowed, there can be no difficulty in removing this objection.

If the claims are'consldered as no clalms, is thp property to be condemned as a matter'of course?

If the captors in ease of capture sena in a vessel, aiter taking ont the master. supercargo and every other persim who- wou1 probably claim; and, leave on board only one or two of the crew whose examinations may be taken in preparatorio, and who are wolly ignoiant as to the property on boarl,-i r when a vessel and cargo thus sent iWis libelled :s prize, is it to be condemned of course As prize, because no claim Ls put in or.filed for it?

If all the papers and documents, and evidence in preparatorioprovt the property not liable ti condemnation, is it to be -condemned because no claim is filed for it by the owner?

This doctrine would fHlow from the arguments upon the other side, but it is too monstrous to be supported by any Court.

·It is not like the case of a judgment by default in a COurt of common law, where the Plaintiff takes judgnitnt for his debt; becanse, at commmn law, the process has been personally served upon the Defendant, he is actually in Co-i't, or has been proceeded against to outlawry. No sarprize can be conpliained of by him. .Not so in a Court 'f admiralty, where the proceeding is in rent. ; and whert the owner may neverl know that his
property is in 'jeopardy. The. Court being possessed of it'are bound to giv' it tip to no body but him who has a gnod right ro it. If from the libel and the proofs before the Court it appears that the captors are entitled to the pr6perty, the Conrt will decree it to them ; otherwise not. Aad for this. among other reasons, it is an invariablb' rule that a claim mst always lie Vut in under dath, so that if the Court or,l,,r prolerty to be restored
to the Claimant, they may at least have some evidence of
'his right to.it.

For these reasons iftherewure notclaims put in to this
property at all, yet, as from the proofs in tha case taken' in preparatorioit is clearly not enemy's property, I contend that the Court could not condemn it as prize of war.

This case, being that of a re-cap ire, is a case in which the questions are, whether the property shall be re4t'ed to the original owilers, and upon what'termas ? As there
is no pretence that the property belongs to an enrmy, tlhere is no reason that the chin should negate a trensfcr inL transitu;.which lr'.nsf'er is void only when its effect would be to neutralize belligerent property.

S. Of property of American citizens, whose place of residence is not stated.

4. Of property of alien friends, resident in the United States.

5. Of property of subjects of France, residing in France.

First,as to the -vessel.

By the act of congress of 26th June, I8M2, entitled " an act concerning letters of wat que, prizes and prize $goods," section 5, vol. 11? p. 2A0, Is it is enacted, "c that all vessels goods and effects, theV property ",of any citizen of the United States, or of persons " resident within and under the protection of the 6 United States, or of persons permanently resident -within and under the protection of any foreign prince, - government or state in amity with the United States, S whch shall have been captured by the enemy and which " shall be re-captured by vessels coinihissioned as afbre" said, shall be restored to the lawful owners, upon pay"cment by them respectively of a just. and reasonable "csalvage,to be determined by the mutual agreement of
" the parties concerned, or by the decree of any Court c"having comp tent jurisdiction, according to the nature cc df each case, agreeably to the provisions heretofore ,"cttablished by law."

Now the provisions heretofore established by law are to be found in an act of congress passed on the sd.arch., I8oM, vo 5, p. 38.

This act after providing for the restoration, of ves-

sels and goods; after re-captnre, upon the ates ofsalva.je

therein mentioned, proceeds in th:-se words, - and if tho

Svessel so re-taken shall appear to have been set forth

it said, the former owner or owners on the restoration

Under this act I presume the Court cannot hiesitate in affirming the judginmnt of the Circuit Court with costs anti expenses of prosecuting this appeal.
Second, aq-to the property of American citizens, resident in the United States.
The a't of .-March, i800, -Vol. 5, p. 38, is positive in its provisions upon this subject/ the property must be xesto.ed upon one sixth salvage.
The decree of the Circuit Court upon this property, I contend ought also to be affirmed with costs.
.Tlird, as to the property of Americlin citizens, whose place of residence is not stated.
This, in my view or the sulject, is the only point in the'cause upon which the mind can at all hesitate, and when this'i fully considered, [ trust all doubt upon it will vanish.
It is contended on the part of the captors, that as no place of residence is mentioned, these Awuerican citizens must be considered as resident in France, and tlat the rule as to the. restoration of the priperty of French su)jects must therefore apply to them. To this I allswer,
First. T do not think the presumption a fair one, that because no place of resi'lence is mentioned, they are therefo,-e to be. cons;;lernd as resi.in.g in Frhnce. As thoy are citizens of the United States, it would seem to In- that they ought fairly to be presumed as residing in tho. rinited States, until some evidence is produced to the contrary.
If lhbwever the Court think it important# that the Claiman.s should prove their place of residence, they will, I presume, giire us an opportunity ofdoing so.

Secondly, that the place of residence is wholly imma- mn-

Because, being American citizens, and there being no:- -

thing itnla%ful in their residing in France, or any other

country, with which we are at ptace, they have not forfeitd any of their rights as citizens ottthe United States'.

And the doctrine that r( sidt nee abroad, gih es a natiunal

nations whict, are at war with each other; or tW neutrals r.siding in one of th. two belligerent nations ; but call-

The question, as to the terms upon which this class of Claimants are to havG their property restored, deju,nds upon the construcion of the act of congress, which I shall now consider.

By-the act ofJlarch, 1800, before referred to, it is de. dared, that when any goods which shall hereafter be taken as prize - by any vessel, acting under authority froin "the government of the United States, shall appear to "chave before'belonged to any person or persons resi-
cc dent xwithin or under the protection of the United States, 6Gand to have been taken by an enemy of the United "States," &c. This question depends upon the construc. tion of the above clause of the section.

In 'order that the property should be restored upon the payment of one sixth salvage, it must belong ,, to "some person or persons resident within, or uu'er the
9'protection of the United States."

If it belongs to any person resident*withinthe United States, it is to be so restored : or if it belongs to any persomn who is under tiw protectioa of the United States, yhetber he resides therein or not, it is to be restored upon the same terms.

ffllforeigners who are permitted to reside in the United States, are under their protection, but no person who re-
sides out of the United States is underthe prptectionof th? ]Vnited States, but their ozwn citizens.

SUPREME COURT U. Is

.IrBT

In 2 Cranch -ep. 120, this Court held "tlint an

SCHOo nR American citizen residing abrotd is entitled to the pro.

ADkJi,3N tection of his gavernment."

.8gain, every foreigner who resides in the United States, must necessarily be under their protection, the words therefore ,,or under the protectionof the United States" would be nugatory if intended to be applied to such foreigners, and'no effect can be given to those
words, unless they are applied to citizens, residing out of the United States, but who arc still under their protectioi. But if the words of the act of .6areh, 1800, are of doubtful import, their true construction is I thin) put out of.l1 doubt, by the act of 26th June.1812, before referred to. These two acts of congress beihg in prl inateria, must be consillered as one act, and construed
accordingly.

The 5th section of the act of Jupe, 1812, declares "that " all vssels, goods and eff:cts, the property of ahly citi"cZen oJ the United States, or of presons esident within
"and under the protection of the United Sta:es," shall be rstored "'agreably to the provisions heretofore esta-
Sblished bylaw."

Now ihere were no other 'provisions established by law, than those contained in the act of MAarch, 1800.

It is evident that congress must have intended by the act of Afarch, 1800, to provide for restitution of the property (iafny citizen pf the United States, whether he
resided within the United States or not. This is the only construction by which the provisions of these two acts can be reconciled.

That this was the construction intended by congress, when these laws were passed, will be still more evident when we examine with a little more care, the different
phraseology of them.

The act of laych, 1800, says nothing about citizens of the United States, but speaks of property belonging to persons resident within or under the protection of the United States, t.lireby nieaning, as I contend, filpersons who reside within the United States, and aU citi-

The act of'Jue, 1812, provides for the cases of property - of any citizens of the United States," and oi "sper,.sons resident witl~ih and under the protection of the

A foreigner, residingin and under the protectionof the' Unitet, States, is entitled to hai e his property restored under this act. This clause of the sentence does not apply to citizens at all, because their property is already provided for by the words fc.any citizen of the United States."

By the act of Jlarch,1800, the property of all persons
resident within, or of persons under the protection oj th United States, is to be restored; withoult which latter words, no provision was made for citizens out of the country, these words were for that-reason unquestionably inserted.

For these reasons I contend that it is irmnterial
where the American citizens reside, they are entitled to have their property restored upon paying one sixth as salvage.

Fourth, as to property of alien friondg, resident in the United States.

-NTo observations are necessary to prove that under the acts of congress referred to, they are entitled to restorafion upon paying one sixth salvage.

Aisto them the decree I presume will be affirmed with costs'and expenses.

Fifth,as to the property ofsubjects of France residing in that country.

By the 3dsect. of the act of Mlarch, 1800, vol.5, p. 40, 'this property is to be restored upon the same salvage on which, by the laws of France, the property of American citizens would have been restored to them under similar

I confess my ign6rance, and I have endeavoured in vain to obtain information about it.
If no such French rule is Known to the Court, tlien I claim-this property belonging to French subjects, residing in France, upon the same salvage which by the act of congress, it ought to be restored to them, if they resided in the United States;

Most of the cargo has been claimed; but no claim whatsoever has been put in for the property expressed in the bill of lading, No. 23, (26 bundles of steel to be delivered to C. W. Huty, of Philadelphia,) nor to that ex -pressed idi No. 3.5) (a harp and case of stri;gs to be delivered to T. Delort, who has come in and claimed other property,) nor' to that expressed in No. 39, (1 case of pencils, on account and risk of Mr. Fongarolly, of Now York.)

In our Courts, for want of any sudi regulations, defaults, as I understand, are usually taken, but the property not put out of the poiver of the Court for a reasonable time. It is unnecessary tddiscuss the propriet of that arrangement in the present case ; for certainly, after the lapse of a year, where the parties, who ought to claim,

-of claiming, must be regarded as intentional ; and indicating that they canunt make out a fair case for restoration.

Mr. Ogden contends for restitution without salvage, on~another ground; that this lihel being for condemnation as enemy's property and prize .ofwar, salvage cannot be.awarded under it; -therefore, says he, it.must be restored without salvage. That conclusion is early il-
logicil, for if it were true that salvage could not be awarded under these proceedings, the only conseqtietice would be that the property should be retained, and the re-cap. t.rs turned round to libel for salvage- 'he position it-
self. from which"the conclusion is drawn, is, also erroneous; for in all cases of military salvagc, the proceediugs are as against a prize, and the payment or salvge. is a condition necessarily imposed by the decree of resi:
titution on the Claimant. It is not properly the thing
sought for by the Libellant au contested by the Claimant. I do not mean to say that it may not have bec done from greater caution and perhaps want of practical experience, in the United States ; or that if done, it ought
not to be supported, hut it is neither usual nor necessary. Mr. Ogden refers, to a precedent of that kind ii HaIals aNiriralty.practice, I have not the book by me, and cannot refer to the authority. but if it be a libel fur mere military salva.je, the iittroduction of it in thatbook shews

By what right, or by what course of proceedings were the re-captured crew examined ib preparatorio, or the papers on board her opened and inspected by the prize commissioners? Because she was subject to be dealt with according to prize lI'w. By a former prize act of England (33 G. & c. 66, § 42,) it was enacted that re-captured ships set forth by the enemy as vessels of war, should wvholly be. long to the captors, and not be restored to the original owners. How was such a vessel to be proceeded against, but by libelling her as prize, and condemning her as enemy's property ? So in the present case, part of the re-captured property is French, which we contend (and for the pre.sent I shall take for granted) ought to be con.demned to the captors and not restored at all. How are we to proceed for that condemnation, but by libtlling as prize of war? Why', underthe rule of reciprocity, is it not to be restored ? Because by the French law belligerent property, of which an enemy has had 21 hours possession; is considered to have changed owners, to be the absolute property of that enemy, and when re-captured it is treated as the absolute property of that enemy, and condemned as such by libel foir prize of war, The rulo of reciprocity, (I Rob. ,Ad. Rep. .Ar. Edit. p. 53, in the case of thd Santa Critz,) induces us to consider French property, (placed in such cirCumstances as would, under
the laws of that countryo be held to make a complete hange of ownership of American belitgerent property,) as also acquired by the enemy ; and to adjudicate upon it as actual enemy's p.roperty; of course to libel and condemn it as prize of war. Xon constat till the claims are put in and sworn to, but that property, apparently American.is actually French ; and it iA recessary to proceed for prize, ih order to get those claims and ascertain that fact. A remarkable instance of that occurs, eyen in the present ease. The bill of lading (No. $5.) of 280 caseg of ciaret, state them to lie. shipped by order and for account and risk of DAvid Dunham, (presenting a primna facie case of American property.) but when Mr. Dunham comes to claim on oath, he states them to ble the property of Messrs. Johnson and Dowling suljets of tl French empire. How was the knowlelge ofthat fact to be obtained, but by forcing a claim on oath? and if we

If there be any title to lie opposed to this, it must be

property was libelled as enemy's property and prize of wari and further proof wus ordered or the property and destination. It was niade and deemed satisfacto'y ; but the captors insisted that restoration should only be made
on lerms of salvage. This was resisted by the Claimants with arguments which perhaps have given rise to the present point by the Claimants, although it was not a
case of re-capture or seizure jure belh frnm an enemy, Sir William Scott held it was a case i which nw military salvage was due ; lut directed (as the price of restoration in tis prize cause,) a civil salvage' of 500t. to be
paid. In tlhe case of the Jongo Lambert, 5 Rob. 5', reported in ahnote to the Carlotta, a Datck ship and cargo captured by a French priVateer and re-captured was li-
belled as enemy's property and prize-of war. She was
condmned to the Court below. Tihe sentence was reversel on app,,al, but as it was neutral property re-cap-
tured, the lords of appeal referred it to their surro.ptaes to,
decide whethet'r ny and what salva.ewas dte,'%with provisions for executing their decree. The surrogates decided that nq salvage was due ; but it is clear that ifit
had been a case f'ox salvage, the restitlition, on this reversal of the sentence 'ifcondemnation, would have only
been on payment of it. It is unnecessary to discuss the argaments drawn fr,lm oir difterent and totally inapplicable modes of proceeding under our municipal code.
And I s.hall ojnly. a'ld that if the objection taken to this mode of proceeding should be sustained, as the error, though fallen into, after much consideration, arose from

bellants to'have appealed from that part of the decree which restores the ship on p.ynient of a ijniety of the valtiv for the salvage. Ther is fin such decree on the record. The restoration of the vessel on paying a moiety for salvoge was agreed to by all parties. afid therefore has in fact never been decreed at all and never has been disputed. If the vessel were understood to be included in the words of the decree, ",American pr.,pert)," we should indeed have ample grounds of appeal ; for the salvage ordered would be only one sixti.. That, however, is not the case, 'and nothing is brought before this .burt, but the questions relating to the re-capturt d goods. The same answer applies to the mistake, that Nie have appealed from the decree of the Court ri'fusing us stdvage on the freight. There is no such decree afid %c%ntever asked it, as our libel shews..though the case of the .Uorthy Foster, 6 Rob. Eng. Ed. 88, slhews we are entitled to -it. No question of freight was ever presented in this
case, but by the claim of Al,'xanuer Cranston (for the hip owners,) of-freight for the goods not claimed by him for them; meaning to make our salvage on the goods pay, a proportion of it, and so diminish its amount. That was not adjudged, and of course we have not appealMd; though if it had been decreed, we certainly shot Id; for it could be supported by no principle, and would be di. r4ectly conutiry to the act of congress.

These questions being out of the way, nothing more remains but to consider what is to be the fate of the recaptured goods which have been claimed, with the incidental consideration of costs and expenses. Part of this property has been claimed, and sworn to, only as belonging to the alleged owners before andat tle tiieof capture, without saying any thing as to its ownership ut the time of kipuzent. On this insufficient mode of claiming and its consequiences I shall add nnting to Mr. Woodwards ar.g iment except a reply to Mr. Ogden's observation, that there is no reas,,n why snch transfers it transitu between belligerent friends should be prevented. This very case shews otherwise; for if the property continued French, it would be subiect to condeuination as enemy's property and prize of war; ;hich belligerent right would be defeated by such a transfer.

Tim colisidering the great general division of French prbpei.SCH6ONER ty, and of American property re-captured ; and will oflA,)BLINE. deavour to class the doubtful cases under ohe or other of
.- those heads.
As to the Frenchprop.rty, it clearly must be judged upon according to the rule of reciprocity. In France, Am rican belligerent property .which had been 2n hours, in the possession of the enemy captors would be treated and,'bonsidered as their property, and not restored on sa-lvage. The law of 24a hours possession has in truth been always the rule adopted by France and Spain, and mlst it not all the powers on the continent; for altlough they may desire a decree of condemnation, they desire it only as the most portabie and compendious proof of the facts (inbluding 21 hours possession) from which the title has accrued. They do not regard the decree as cre4tingjpa title to the property, which doctrineis in truth only confined to England and this country ; and was not held even by this coantry during the revolutionary war. France has aJso made an ordinance on that subject. which is to be found in !ZSti, 276, and of which this Court must well be held to have judieial knowledge; for the prize Court, to'which it has succeeded, has recognized it in the case of .filler 4-at.

The claim is Isingular; for it is predicafed not on the rights of the parties, but on the supposrd ignorance of the Court. It is not sanctioned by the words of the act of Oarch sd, 1800. (§3, Tol. 5, p. 38.) hich provides that " where no such law or usage shall he known." the same salvage shall be allowed as is provided by the 1st section of that act. That mnans, where no such law or usage shall be made known or promulgated or acted upon. It refers to eases in which, on enquiry, a state shall not be found to have adopted any precise lav or usage on.ths' subject; but it founds no right to a suitor, on supposed judicial igpnorance.

The ymoperty of Anmerican citiens resident in France must, as I conceive, u( considi reil as French, and subject to the samC rule. This effect of domicil or natiinal character is product d inevery (asl Nhere that chaiicter is .Judged of '°erely by'the law of nations. Birth, by 'the municipal labs of many coantries, is considt-red as fixing an indelible national character ; but that doctrin6 seenis etirehl dependl.nt on municipal law, and is n-it to be found in the writ'rs on the law of natiodfs. ]Birth, with them, affords a prina facie presumption of
residence, and serves to establish it where other facts are equivn".al or silent ; ancl in that sense sir W. hcott must be understood, when lie sa)s, in the c.ise of'La Virginie, 5, Rob. 98. 99, -,that the native ciatcter ca" sily rrverts, and that it requires fewer circumstances to c constitute domicil in the case of a native subject than
cto impress the national*character on one who is oricgginally" of another coutry." But birth ceases to afford eviilence-of the nationd character under the law oE natiofis. when ofpposed to a clear residence, animo7nanen-
di, in another country ; for, says sir William Scott, in the Italian Chie, 3 Rob.

In some of tlesecas6e (the par-
ticulars of which I shall hereafter point out) it may perlhaps be contended that, although the owner of the property appears to be.resident in France, the permanency
of his residence or the aniinus.inauendidoes not ap:pear; but to that I again answer in the words of sir Win. Scott, in the case of th Bernon, I Rob. Jim. cd. 87,

Theffth sectio ofthe ac! of June, 1812, cannotexplain TIM the antecedent law of M/arch, ±800; for it is obviously scnotuvnn inadvertently worded, and nut int..nded fMr any purpose ADtILNE.. of explaining, altering, or affecting that law. If the mistaken substitution of the word anl for or could have any effect, it would be only to shew that no person residing out of the United States in a constlar or public capacity could be d&emed under their protertiin, The truth, however, is, that the last act contemplates nothing more than to place re-raptures by privatt armed ships, on the same footing with those made by public vessels of war; ana it acomplishes that by a very loose phraseology.
If I am well founded in the fore.going arguments, jt will folloW that the decrees of the Courts below respecting French property and that of all the residents in Francf,, whether native Auericans or not, should be affirmed ; and (if costs and expenses ire to be at all given in this case) with both.
I shall now consider the question as to clear American goods re'naptured. The Adeline was a private vessel of war, havingalettdr of marque; and, when hn theI p)s-. session of the English, she fought with and made rcsistance to the privateer Expediti6n. There can, therefore, be no qu stion bit that the salvagt' of the vessel itself must be one half. The Claimants, hn wever, contend that such a rate of salvage only ext .nds to tbto vessl ; but- that goods re-captured on board of even arn armed and commissioned vessel imtist be restored on paying one sixth; that being the. rate sperified in the act of Jarch 3d, 1800 : and in support of this opinion several rules for the construction 'f statutes hav,, bean cited. It is :my duty, and I trust I shall do it sccessfmmlly, to maintain the opposite doctrine. In order to do sop IVshall observ.' tait salvage fins, in every country and iW every code of laws, been considered as a matter of ge. neral average: the service is an act done fr the con mon bsnefit, and to be recompensed by conmmdn and proportionatecontributions. Ye;sel an:l cargo always contribute expressly; fright, in some rases, expessly; in others, really but less obviously, where tike salvors receive their proportion of the varg) or its value without paying freight. If the act of 3d .1farch, 1800, meant to

280

THA break iii upon this established principle of proportionate

SCHOONER contribution for a common benefit, it -is withtpuL pre-

turefvurn an universal usage'founded' on justicb and

common utility. Such a supposition should not be in-

dulged in; and it is indeed fully contradicted by the

second section of the same law ; for there, regulating the

salvage tn the re-capture of a public armed vessel, it

enacts that for the re-capture of a public armed vessel

orany goods therein, one moiety of the true value thereof

shall be pard. No satisfactory reason has been or can

be assigned why the United States should be obliged to

pay differently and in a greaterpproportion for the, bone-

fit of re-capture than private individuals deriving equal

advantage from the act. This second section of the act

naturally presents the qtfestion, how it.happoned that

the legislature omitted to mention expressly in the first

section, goods on board such arined vessel ? I think I

can answer it. The first section is copied from the En-

glish statutes on the same sii! iect. varying the propor-

tion ofsalv.age, and with one ad(lit on the operation and

force of which, perhaps was notstillirien.ly adverted to at

the time. Statutes of t, G. 2, c. 4.-17, G. 2, c. 3.-

ciplh ofproportion'atiC contribution Ftir a common benefit

was not departed fr',m; for to st the v:ssel out for war,

it must have been condtcted into po!'t, and, of course,

charged, and the conneioin between them 'brokon ; the

goods which sich a vessel mi.ght have on boaard when

re-captured would be enemy's property. and condemn-

ed as prize of wal'. The British acts, therefore, made

no mention of such goods, fhey not bing a fit subject

for restoration on salvage. Congress, in preparing

their system, although they adhered to the pbraseology

they thought it unne. esary to do more than setth die

of it alone ; but conceived and intended that a propor-

tionate contribution from eve-ry thing counected %,ithit

in danger and benefit conurred, wold follow as an in-

cident. If the first suppositdn be true, tlie awarding of

*salvage for the re-rapturet) goods on board an armed

ves~cl is a casus omissus ; and th least wi can be war-

ranted in saying is, tat it is in the dIiscretion of tho

Court to settle that rate. If it be, I trust it will be set-

tled by analogy to the rule made in the act itself, and so

as to preserve the harmonyif the whole system. If the

second supposition be correct, then the NoNrl 'vessel usust

be consijiered with a lihe'ral interpretation, as also in-

cluding all on board of it. And in support of such an

interpretation, calculated tio preserve received and es-

tablished usage against a literal meaning, I ma) refer

to the opinion of the Cour. as delivered in the case of

Talbotv. Seaman, i, Cranch, 1.. There the Court had

occasion to consider the meaning of the expression -'any nation in amity with the United States" us:d in

the act of .arch 24 1799, reating also to re-captures

from the enemy : the counsel for the captors contg'nded

thatthe words of"this law gave salvage on the re-capture

of .neutral property : founding themselves, like our ad-

versaries, on the literal extent of the expression. On

which the Court observe'i-, Crnch, 4s, "'Th6 words C; of the act would certainly admit of thii constraction.

statute is titus definedo, "s.Jquitasest verborumlegisdirectio cc efficatius cam una res sotlummodo legis cavetur verbis Ut

And there the remedy given by the 9, B. 3, c. 3, against executors, it is sai l, has be.n always rxtend.'d by an equitable construction to administrators; because they are within the oquity of the sta'tute. Platt v. the sheriff of London, Plowd. 36, the words of the 13, E. 1, are, cr16 cuirspect agatis de negdtiis tangentibirs Episcapimn t6Vorwicensein ;" yet this statute, although only the bishop of Norwich be named, has been always extended, by an equitable construction, to other bishops.

Some of the claims in this can .scare for property owned by aliens resident in the United States. Where
that residence is n it clearly anade )ut to be permanent, the Claimants must take the consiquenco of the iitutilciency of their clains and proofs. They are all Frenchmen. and if they' have .ot.shown a sufficient domicil to obtain for them the :An,'rica. national character, they must be consileeed as Fretchmen and abido the reci-
procity resulting I'r:un their law. Where they are clearly p~rsnanent reside:tis within the United States, they will be entitl'd to t benefit of that character, if my reasbn-

It only remains fr me now to say a few words of
costs and expensl-s which are asked for by the (laimants. This case is brought before this Court by their voluntary act anti a clear consent, without which it could not have been presented on appeal. The district jidgo declared the principles lie would adopt fAr his decision; but, strictly spi.aking, he made no decree on the case of

M~arch iOth. -Ibsent....TODD, J.
STO Y, T. delivered the opinion of the Court as follows:
TheAmerican letterof marque, schooner Adeline, with a valuable cargo bn board, was captured on her voyage from Bordeaux to New York, on or about the 11th of March, 181-, by a British squadron; and, on or about the 19th of the same month, was re-captured by the Arin rican privateer, Expedition, James Clayton, comma..der, and brought into New York for adjudication. Prize prceedings were immediately instituted against the v,.ssel and cargo as enemy property ; and various claims were interposed in behalf of American and French merchants. Upon the hearing of the cause, the district Cdurt decreed a restoraion of all the property of American citizens and other persons resident in the United States, upon the payment of one sixth of the value as salvage, and condemnr d all the property of French subjects aihd of American citizens domiciled in France, and of all others whose re§idence remained unecxplained, as good and lawful prize to the captors. From the former part of the decree the captors appealed, and from the latter part the Claimants appealed to the. Circuit Court; and from an affirmance proforma of the decree in that Court, the parties have appealed to this Court. It does not appear in thd record that any decree was pronounced in respect to the vessel; and it is therefore pr,%bable, as intimated by counsel, that she has been restored on a compromise between the parties interested.
Before we proceed to the consideration of the principal questions which have been argued, it will be proper to notice several objections to the regularity of the allegations, proceedings and proofs in the cause.
It isp in the first place, asserted, on behalf of the Cla-

29411

,StPREME COURT U. S..

Tnr,, mantsp that if this should turif out not to he a case of 00MONER enemy property, but of salvage merely, (as most cerADELINE. tainly as to some of the claims it must be held to be) the
re-captors can take nothing by the present libel, because it proctteds upon the mere fo6ting of the property being
prize of war. And it is likened to the case of a declara-
tion at common law, where the party can only recover
setnundum allegata et probata; and if no count hit the precise case, the party must be non-suited.

If, indeed, there were any thing in this objectipn, it
cannot, ii; any beneficial manner, avail the Claimants. The most that could result would be that the cause would b- remand~d to the Circuit Court with directions to allow an amendment of the libel. Where merits clearly appeair ont te record, it is the settled practice, in admiralty, proceedings, not to dismiss the libel, but to -allow the party to assr.tl his rights in a new allegation. This practice so consonant with equity and sound principle, has been deliberately 'adopted by this Court on former occasions. After all, therefore, the Claimants would, in the language of an eminent civilian, but change postures on an u neasy bed.

But we are all of opinion that there is nothing in tbi ojection. No proceedings can be more unlike than those in the Courts of common law and in the admiralty.
In prize causes, in an especial manner the allegations, the proofs and the proceedings are, in general, modelled upon the civil law, with such additions and alterations
as the practice of nations and the right,; of belligerents and neutrals unavoidably impose. The Court of prize is emphatically a Court of the ]aw of nations; and it takes neither its character nor its rules froii the mere
municipal regulations of any country.

In cases of mere civil salvage, it may be fit and properthat the lihel should distinctly allege and claim salvage, though we d6 tont mean to assert that, even in such
cases, it is indispensable. In casps of military salvage,
also, the party may. i:'he please, adopt 'a similar proceeding. But it is by no means necessary, and, in most
cases, would b ."ihly inexpedient. Re.captures are eimphatically cases of prize ; for the definition of prize
goods is, that they are goods taken on the high sea,

FEBRUARY TERM iSM.
jure belli, but of the hands of the enemy. Whtmn so ta- TH[E 'ken, the captors have an undoubted right to proceed scuoo.agiinst thein as belligerent property in a Court of prizei A.ELUM. for in no other way, and in no other Court can the questions presented on a capture jure beli. be properly or effectually examined. The very circumstancq tIhat it is found in the possession of the enemy, affords pritnafacie evidefice that it is his property. It may have previously posses:ed a neutral or friendly character; but if the property has been changed by a sentence. of condemnation, or by such possession as nations recognize as firm and effectual, the neutral or friendjy owuei i-forever ousted of his right.
It depends altogether upon future proceedings ; upon theexaminations taken in preparatory and the ducuments on board; upon the verity of the claims, and the diligencd and good faith of the Claimants; and upon the principles of international law, comity and rcciprocity, whether a restoration can be decreed or not. How cau these questions be decIded, unless the customary proceedings 6f prize are instituted and enforced ? How can it be known. whether all the documents on board be not colorable and false, or whether the couduct of the Claimant be not unneutral or fraudulent, unless the truth is drawn from the parties intrusted with the property for the voyage, by the trying force of the standing interrdgatories and the test affidavits ? The very case before us present a strong illustration of the propriety of these proceedings. There is" a large shipment on board, which, on the bill of lading, purports to be the property of an American Claimant; yet the Claimant himself expressly swears that it is thesole property of the French. shipper. What the consequences are of that fact will be presently seen,
The Court, then, has a legitimate jurisdiction over the property as'prize; and, having it, will exert its au-' thority over all the incidents. It will decrea a restora. tion of the whole op- of a part; it will decree it absolutely, Dr burthened with salvage, as the circumstances of the case uiay require: and whether the salvage be held a portion of the thing itself, or a mere lien upon it, or a condition annexed to its restitution, it is an incident to the principal question of prize, and within

SUPREME COURT U. S.
TH121 the scope of the regular prize allegation. If, tlere. SCHOONER fore, the case stood upon principle alone. we should ADB9.INk. not doubt as to the sufficiency of the libel for this lai.-
pose ; but it has, also. the clear support of the pra:tice Of the admiralty. The Xquila, I Rob. 37. The Franklin,
B1ob. 1,7. Vicke Jonge Liambert, 5 Ro&. 54!, note.
Another objection urged on behalf of the captors, is to the sufficiericy ol'the claimis and test affidavits. It is asserted, and truly, that the goods are not alleged, in the claim or Affidavitb;, to have belonged to the. Cliaimants at the time of shipment'; it is only alleged that they so belonged at the time ef capture. Regularly the test affidavit should state,that the property, at the time of shipment and also at'ht time of capture, did belong. and will, if restored, belong to the Claimant; but an irregularity of thip nature has never been supposed to be fatal. It thight, in a case of doubt or suspicion, or in a case calling for the application of the doctrine as to the legal effivct of changes of proper-ty in transitu, have jus, tiffed an order for further proof: or, in'cases of gross negligence or pregnant fraud, have drawn upon the party more 9eve.re consequences. But in ordinary cases, it is not deemed to work any serious consequences : in this instance, it p'robably passed unnoticed in the Courts below, where if the blot had been hit, it might have been instantaneously removed by an amendment. Another irregularity undoubtedly was, that the. t st affidavits were put in, on behalf of many of the Claimants, by their agents. althougi the principals were resident in the U. States, and within the reasonable reach of tlje Court. Where the principal is without the, country, or resides at a great distance from the' Court, th admission of a claim and test affidavif by his agent, is the com on corns of,.'the admiralty. But where the principat is within a easonable distance, something more than a formal affidavit by his agent is expected. At least the s.uppletory otthIof the. principal as to the facts, should bo tendered ; f r otherwiso its absence might produce unlavorable suspicions. It,indeed, the principal might always withdraw himself from the view of the Court, and shelter his pretensions behind the affidavit of an innocent or i.gnorant agent, there would be no end to the impositions practised upon the Court. The Court expects, in proper cases, something more than the mere formal test

FEBRUARY TERAI i815.
affidavit of an agenty who may swear, truly, and yet, TEm from his want of knowledge, be the dupe of cunuinlk and scnoo.q= fraud. It is iot meant to assert that any such imputa- A.UML[Y. tions belong to the pros -nt case. Chin irregulai-ity, like the former, probably passed in silence; and it would -be highly.in.u 'ious if an obje-tion ofthis'sortshould now prevail, when all parties have hitherto acquiesced in its immateriality.
We are now led to the principal question in this cause; viz. what rate of salvage is to be allowed ta the re-captors? This depends upon trie true corsttrouion of the salvage act of congress of 3d of"March, 1800, ch. i4. That act provides, that, upon the re-capture of any vessel; (other than a vessel of war, or privateer,' or of any goods belonging to any pesons resident within or under the prote6tion of the United States, the same, if re-captured b, aprivate vessel of the U. States, shall be restored on payment of onesixth part of the value of the vessel or goods ; and if the. vessel, so re-captured, shall app-ar to have been set forth and armed as a vessel or war, bef-are such capture, or afterwards, then upon a salvage of one half of the true value ofsuch vessel of
war.-
. It is argued, in behalf of the re-captors, that the Ade& line being an armed vessel, they are entitled to a moiety of the value of the cargo as well as of the vissel; either upon an eq iitable construction of the statute, or upoh general principles, as a case not within the purview tif the statute.
We are all, howvever, of a dtferent opinion. The statute is expressed in clear and unambiguous terms. It does not give the salvage of one sixth part of the value upon goos, the cargoof an unarmed vessel; but it gives it upon any goods re-captured, -without any reference to the vehicle or vessel in which they are. found. We cannot interpose a limitation or qualification upnn the terms whii the legislature has not itself imposed ; and if there be ground for higher salvyge in cases of armedwes-
sels, either upon public policy or principle, such considerations mlsthb addraqsed with effect to another tribunal. This decision allirins the decree of the Circuit Court as to the claus of all the parties domicilel irr the United States.

28a

SUPREAIM COURT U. S;

TUE SCHOONER 4DELITN .

As tq the claims of the parties domiciled in Francei whethtr natives or Afneicans, or other foreigners, their rights depend altogether upon the law of France us to
re-captures ; for by fthe act of congress, as well as by the general law, in cases of re-capture, the rule of reciprocity is to be applied. If France would restore -n a like case, then are we bound to restove ; if otherwise, then th'6 whole property must be condemned tothe re-cap-
tors. It appears that by the law of France in cases of re-capture, after the property has been 24 hours in possession of the enemy, the whole property is adjudged
good prize to the re-captors, %h%ether it belonged to her subjects, to her allies, or to neutrals. We are bound, therefore, in this case, to apply the same rule ; and au the property in Ais case was re-captured after it had been inpossession of the enemy more than 24 hours, it
must, so far as itbelonged to pel'sons domicild in France, be'condeknned to the captois ; and.the decree of the Circuit Court as to them must be affirmed.

As to the claims of the other persons whoso national chai'acter and proprietary interest do not distinctly appear, considering all the circumstances; we shall direct
farther'proof to be made on both points. As,indeed, the mhaster has not been able to swear directly to'the proprietary interest of the cargo, but simply says that the goods were, as he presumes and believes, the property of the shippeis or the consignees, perhaps, in strictness,
farther proof might hAve been required in the Courts below as to the whole cargo. It was not, how6ver, moved
fi there by the captors ; and as we are satisfied in rela.

i.'Tle invalidity of the grant to Sevier appears upon it. face. It is mutilated by tli erasure of the consideration. And it has been fraudulently altered in a material part.
By the law of North Carolina, the survey must be annexed to the patent, and is a substantial part of it. From this survey it appears that under .0warrants, for 640 acres each, amounting to 25060 acres, there have lipn granted to him more than 50,000 acres.

These objections having been made at .hetrial below, ought to have excluded the patent from the considera-
tion of the jury.

There is a diffP'rence, between a puwic and a private grant. A patent must be issued according to'the requi-
sites of the law or it will be void. It takeq effi'ct mere. ly by the provisions of the law, anti if not made pursit.

In the case of a sale of land by a sheriff for taxes, the
proceedings must be regular and according to the law which authorizes the sale, or it will be void. So tinder

2. The Court ought to have permitted the .laintifl to give evidence, of the'fraud and of the want of foundation
for the patent. In ejectment the deeds are not declared upon, nor set forth in the proccedings, so that the opposite party has nto opportunity to plead the fraud, or the erasUr', &c. He can only produce these facts in ovi.

The evidence of collusion between Sevier and the secretary of state, -and of ihe other fa.ts statcd in the bill

ever slight the evidence might have been of somse of the
facts, yet it ought to have been left to the jury. 6 Crancl 50, Mryland Ins. Co. v. Woods.

The Court below decided that no vidence could be given to invalidate the patent, extept what regarded the entries.

Mr. Lee cited the followiun statutes of North Carolina, from IredelPs revised code, p. 2o05, the act of 1777, ch. t, § 3, 2i.-Id. p. 322, fhe act of 1783, ch. 2, § 2.-id.

JoNFs, cedra.

1. The first objection was to the admission in evidence oftheliatentto Sevier, for any purpase. There was no-
"thing on the face of the patent to make it void. It was not mutilated. There were blanks in it, but no mutilation; and there is no evidence that it was mutilated.

There could be only three kinds of consideration ; fifty shillings--ten pounds-or military service. It could not by lav be either the fir8t or the last. It must therefore have been ten pounds.

The act of the officer carries a presumption that the proper consideration was paid ; and th statute shows
whqt that consideration ought to have been.

2. The next ojection is that the grant comprehends 50,oo6 acres instead of 25 060.

But the grant is only for the 2,O0O, although the

SUPREME COURT U. S.

survey may include more. The statute which p'ohibits
grants for more. titan 5,000 acres, d,e1s not vacate such grants. It is only directory to the officer; and such grants are recognized by.the laws of North Carolina. 178~, ch. 19. The excess is no evidence of such fraud
as will vacate the deed.

The -Defendants were not bound to show the correctness of their entries; nor any' thing else prior to th, patent. The entries were merged in the patent.

As to the second bill of exceptions: it present. but one point. T;he only evidence offered and rejected was th- letter of Sevier to Glassgow. For although it states that tlh Plaintiff offered to prove other facts, yet it does not state that he offered evidence of those facts.

But if the bill of exception imports that such evidence was offered, yet the Defendants were innocent pur-
cha.rs. The contest is not betwecn the original parties. They were not bound to look beyond the patent:
and if the fictc were proved, which the Plaintiff offered to prove, yet the pitent is not thereby made void, but voidable by proppr process. Tho king may avoid his grants where a ;ubject could not, 10 Go. 113, Legate's ca.e; but it must be either by quo iwarranto or scirc facias, or information in the nature of a quo -warranto;
which is a-process in the nature of a procoeding in ren: There is-no instance where it has been declared void
when brought collaterally into question. And although a s'otut., dreclares a grant void, yet it is not actually void, hut voidable. 7 Bac..db. 61, B. 6 Cranch, ;L80, Fletcher v. Peck.

In the case from Harris and X.1J,cnj 's reports, the state of Maryland sought to set aside the grant by on
infomatiun, and it only shiews that upon such a process the frad upon the stut,: may be given in evidence. In tho present case no fraud or irregularity has been suf ficiently alleged to set aside the deed.

1. It is said that the lands did not lie in Washington county. This is no objection;( because the party had a right to iremove his entry.

FEBRUARY TERM i81.

2. The charge that the consideration of 101. was FoLa's

frandulently inserted, is too vague and general. If the Lnss=

party had not paid the 0l1. he was still indebted to the V.

state in that sum; and the deed is not for that caus6 WENDELL

old as to an innonent purchaser.

& Ax.

3. That there were no entries authorizing the warrants. This objection is equivocal, and involves questions of fact and law.

4. That the warrants were forgeries.

The patent cannot be declared void for any prior ir regularity. In ejiectment you must stop at the patent.
And the prior patent gives the better title.

5. That at the time of the cession of the lands to the United States there were no entries authorizing the
warrants.

This is in substance the same as the third objectiou. It is too general and vague, and involves fact and law.

6. That no consideration was paid. This, if true, does not avoid the patent; for if the money was not paid Sevier remains debtor for it to the state.

.With regard to the letter to Glassgow, it is not. material what alteration was made as to the consideration. No evidence of alteration was important, unless it were such alteration as would vacate the deed. This letter contains no such evidence. It must .have referred to some other patent; because the letter was dated in November, 1795, and refers to some instrument then iu complete; but the patent in this case was completed in
the preceding August.

As to the issuing of the grant by the state of North Carolina after the cession of the territory to the United States, the act of cession provided for the issuing of such grants upon entries previously made. It does not appear that the entries in this case were not made before the cession. The Plaintiff's grant was also issi.ed by the state of North Carolina, fivQ years after tho i)e-
fendant's.

The patent is void on its face. It appears to have been obliterated. 'his fact, together with the letter to

Unless the patent conveys all the land within the described botanrs, it is vague and uncertain. It cannot 'be limited to the 25,060 acres. If it conveys any thing, it conveys the whole b0,000 acres.

MAssHAL, Ch. .1. after stating tue case, delivered the opinion of the Court as follows:

The first exception is to the. a.dmission of the granL set up by the Dvfendants in bar of the Pltintiff's title. This objection alleges the grant to be absolutely void
for thufee causes.-

The first is, That no grant could lawfully issue for the quantity of land expressed in this patent.

If this objection be well founded, it will beconclusive. Its correctness depends on the laws of the state of North Carolina.

The act of 1777, oli. I, opens tie land office of the state, and directs an entry-taker to %eappointed in each county, to receive entries made, by the citizens, of its vacant lands, The third section of this act contains a proviso that no person shall. be entitled to claim 9 greater quartity of land than 640 acres, where the survey shall he bounded" by vacant land, nor more than

FEBRUARY TE RI i8ts.

i,O00 acres between lines of land already surveyed for PoL's

other persons.

LESSE

10.
The fourt4 section fixes the price of land thus to be wrn.Enm
entered .at 50 shillings per hundred acres; after which & A.. follows Aproviso that if any person shall claim more than 6-0' acres fTr himself, and lOo acres for his wife
and each of his children, he shall pay for every hundred acres exceeding that quantity, five pounds,-and so in proportion. But this permission to take up more than the specified quantity of lands at five pounds for every hundred acres, does n)t extend to Washington coilnty.

In June, 1781, ch. 7, the land office was closed, and further entries for lands, prohibited. -

Jn April, 1783, ch. 2, the land office was again opened, and the price of lands fixed at ten pounds for each hundred acres. The ninth section of this act authorizes any citizen to enter, with the entry-taker to be appoint-
ed Oy the assembly, "6a claign for any lfads, provided
"such claim does not exceed 5,000 acres."

This act limits the amount for which an entry might he made. But-the same person is not, in this act, forbidden to make differ'nt entries; and entries were trans; ferrable. .No prohibition appears in the act, which should prevent the assignee of several entries, or tie person W'ho has nade several entries, from uniting them in one surey and patent. The Cburt does not perceive, " in r,,ason or in the directions of the law respicting sur* veys, any thing which should r-strain a surveyor from
including several entjies in the same survey. The forn, of surveys, which is prescribed by law, if that rulb should be considered as applicable to surveys made on several entries united. may he observed, and, in this case, is observed, notwithstanding the union of different entries.

In April, i781, ch. 19, the legislature again took up this subject, and, after reciting tfit it had been found impracticable, to survey most of the entries of lanus madb adjoining the large swamps in the eastern parts of the state agreeable to the manner directed by the
acts then in force, without putting the makers thereof

SUPREME COURT U. S.

voL es
LESsEu
, .
WENDELL
& AL.

to great and unnecessary expenses, empowered surveyors in the eastern parts of the state to survey for .ny person or persons, his or their entries of lands in or adjoining any of the great swamps in one entire survey.
The third section enacts, " that where two or more "persons shall have entered or may hereafter enter "lands jointly, or where two or more persons agree to c"have their entries suiveyed jointly in one or more " surveys, tL, surveyor is empowerrd and requiA'cd to ccsurvey the same accordingly in one entire survey; " and the persons so agreeing to have their entries surcc veyed, or entering lands jointly, shall hold the same ",as tenants in common, and not as joint-tenants."

The fourth section secures the same fees to the surveyor a"d secretary as they would have been entitled to claim, had the entries been surveyed and granted separately.

As all laws on the same subject are to be taken together, it is argued that this act shows the sense of the legislature respecting the xr'do of surveying entries, and must be taken into view in expounding the various statutes on that subject. It evinces unequivocally the legislative opinion that, as the law stood previoui to its
paAsage, a joint survey of two entries belonging to the same person or to different persons, could not be made,
The right to join different entries -in the same survey,
then, must depend on this act.

The first and second sections of this act relate exclu-
sively to entries- made in or adjoining to the great swamps in the eastern parts of the state.

The third section is applicable to the whole country, but provides only .for the case of entries made by two or more persons. It is. therefore, contended that the
Court cannot extend the provision to the case of dis-
tinct entries belonging to the same person.

For this distinction it is impossible to conceive a rea-. son: No motive can le imagined 1nr all.wing two or more persons to unite, their entries in one survey, which
does not apply with at least as much force for allowing

FEBRUARY TERM isiS.
a single person to unite his entries adjoining each other roLit's in one survey. It appears to the Court that the case LI'Ss, comes completely within the spirit, and is not opposed 10. by the letter of the law. The case provided for is, wEnIDELT " where two or more persons agree to have their entries & A.' ",surveyed jointly," &c. Now this agrees-uent does not-prevent the'subseqaenl assignment of the entries to one c f the parties; and the assignment is litseif the agreement of the assignor that the assignee inay surve., the tha entries jointly or separately, at his eleetion. "lao Coui-t is of opinion that, under a sound construction of thislaw, entries which might he joined in one survey, If remaining the property of two or more. persons. may be.so joined, though they become the property of i single person.

The second objection to the admission of the grant is, that the-amount of the consideration origii:dly expressed on its face appears to have been torn out.
The grant stands thus: -for and in consideration c of - pounds," &C.

The Court is unanimously and eleariy of opinion that there is nothing in this objection. It-is not suggested, nor is there any reason to believe, that the words were obliterated for fraudulent purpbsea, or fob the purpose of avoiding the grant. They may have been taken out by some accident ; and there is no difficulty in supplying the lost words. The consideration pnid was ten ]pounds for each hundred acres ; and theye can be no doubt that the word " ten" is the word which is obliterated. Had the whole grant been lost, a copy might have been given in evidence; and it would be strange if the original should be excluded because a word which could not be mistaken, and which, indeed, is not esential to the validityof the grant, has become illegible.
The third exception is, that the grant, on its face, appears fraudulent, because it has issued for 25,060 acres of land, alth6"ugh the lines which circumsc'rihe it, and which 'are recited in it comprehend upwards of 0,000 acres.

It is the opinion of this Court that there was no or. ror in permitting the grant under which the Defendant claimed title, to go to the jury.

Te remaining exceptions were taken aftei the grant was before the jury, and are ftr'causes not apparexit on Its face. They present one general questio of great importance to land holders in the state of Tennessee. 'It is-this :'Is it, in.any, and, if in auly, in what, eases, allowable, in an ejectinent, to Impeach a grant from the state, for causes anterior to its being issued ?.

Incases depending on the statutes of a state, and more especially in those respecting titles to land, this Court adopts the construction bf the state where that construction is settled, and can be ascertairled. But it is -not understood that the Courts ofTennesse- have de.cided any other point bearihg on the subject than thisp that unde0 their statutis declaring an elder grAnt founded on ' younger .try to be void, the priori(y of enfties is exaniinable at law; and that a jtnior patent fouinled
on'a prior enitry bhall prevaif in an ejectment againlsta
scnioi patent founded on a'jbnior entity. The question
·whether there are other cases in which a party may, at law, go. beyond'the gritnt fdr the'purposeof avoidiig it remains undecided.

. Thelaws for the sale of pulic lards provide many .guards to se'ure ihe reglilarify of grants, to protect the Micipient rights-of individuals, aad also to protect'tho state fromimposihon.- Officers are-appointed to superintend the business; and rules are framed prescribing their duty. These rules are, in general. directory; and when all the .plocbedings te completed by a patent issued by the authority of the*state, 'a compliance With these.rules is pre-sjiupposed. That every lperquisite has' been performed, is an inference properly deducible, and which every man has a right to draw from the existence of the grant itself. It would, therefore, be oe-

FEBRUARY TERbt .Tii.

"tremelyunreasonable to avoid a grant in any Court for irregularities in the conduct of those who areappointed by the government to supervise the progrn ssive course of p. title from its comiuencerfint to its consummation
in a patent. But there are some things so essential to the validity of the contract, that the great pi in( ipl. s of
justice and of law would be vi',Iated, did there not exist some tribunal to which an Wijured party might appeal, and in which tife means by which an elder title was acquired, might be examined. In general, a Court of equity appears to be a tribunal better adapted to this object than a Court of law. On an ejectient, the plead-
ings give no notice of those latent defccts of wh;ch the party means to avail himself; anil, should he be allowed to use them, the holderof the elder grant might often be surprized. But iri equity, the specific points must
be brought into view; the"various circumstances con-
nected with those points are considered ; and all the testimony respecting them may be laid before the Court. The defects in the title are the p~trticular bjects of investigation ; and the decision or a Court in the last resort upon them is decisive. The Court may,,.on a view of the Whole case, annex equitable conditions to its de-
cree, or order what may be reasonable, without abso-
lutely avoiding a whole grant. In the general, then, a Court -of equity is the more eligible tribunal for these questions; and they ought to be excluded from d Court
of law. But there are cases in.which a grant is abso-
lutely void; as where the stito has no title to the thing granted; or where the officer had no authority to issue tile grant. In. such cases,, the validity of tie grant is necessarily examinable at law.

on which the grant to Sevier was founded, and that the warrants themselves were forgeries. He also offered

SUPREME COURT U. S.
POLK's to prove that, at the time of the cession to congress of iFss. the territory in which tlivwse lands lie, the warrants did
V. not exist, nor were there any locations in the office from ivE LL which they purport to have issued, to justify their is-
& AL. s,,ig.
In the state of North Carolina itself, the want of an entry would seem to be a defect sufficient to render a grant null.
The act of 1777, which opens the land office and directs the appointment of an officer in each county, denominated an entry-taker, to receive entries of all vacant lands in his county, directs the entry taker, if the lands shall not be claimed by some other person within three months, to dpliver to the party a copy of the onti;y with its prOper number, and an order to the county sfirve r to survey the same. This order is called a warrant.
The ninth section of the act then declares, "that "every right, &c. by any person or persons set up or ,pretended to any of the before mentioned lands, which "shall not be obtained in manner by this act directed, "or by purchase or inheritance from some person or "persons becoming proprietors by virtu6 thereof, or "which shall be obtained in fraud, evasion or elusion "of the proyis.ions and restrictions thereof, shall be " deemed and are hereby declarel utterly void."
The act of 1783, which agains opens the land office, pLppoints an entry-taker for the western district, and prescribes rules for making entries in his oflice, and for granting warrants similar to those which had been framd for the government of the entry-takers of the rerpective counties.
In the year 1789 North Carolina ceded to congress the territory in.vhich the lands lie for which Sovier's grant was made, reserving, h6wever, all existing rights Jnder the state, which were to be perfected according to the laws of North .0arolina. This cession was accepted by congress.
Sevier's survey is dated on the 26th'day of May, 1795.

FEBRUARY TERM Isis.

The lands for which the warrants were granted, by virtue of which the survey was made, lie within that district of country ior which the land office was opened by the act of 1777. Had the survey been made on the land originally claimed by these warrants, it must have been a case directly within the ninth section of the act; and the right is declared by that section to be utterly void. But the survey was made dn different lands by virtue of an act which cmpowers the surveyor so to do in all cases of entries on lands prei ,usly apprapriated.
This clause in the law, howevir, does not authorize a survey where no entry has'been made; and such survey would also come completely within the provision of the ninth section. In such case, there is no power in the agents of the state to make the grant; and a grant so obtained is declared to be void.

This subject is placed in a very strong point of vie%%
by considering it in connexion with the cession made to the United States. After that cession, the state of
Worth Carolina had no power to sell an acre of laud within the ceded territory. No right could be acquired under the laws of that state. But the right was reserved to perfect incipient titles. The fact that this 'title
accrued before the cession does not appear on the face of the grant. .t is, of course, open to examination. The survey was not made until May, 1795, many years posterior to the cession. It purports, however, to have been made by virtue of certain warrants founded on entries which may have been made before tlhe cession. But if these warrants had no existence at tlie time o the cession, if there were no entries to justify them, what right could this grantee have had at the time of tihe cession? The Court can perceive none; and if none existed, the gr-ant is vold for want of power in the state of North Cakolina to.make it.

If, as the Plaintiff offered to prov the entries were never made, and the warrants were forgeries, then no right accrued under the act of 1777; no purchae of the land was made from the state; and, independent of the act of cession to the United States, the grant is void
by the express words of the law.

but no commencement of. right had taken place in the ceded territory previous to the cession, so as to bring the party withip the rcserration contuined in the a't of cession. then the grant must be void, there being no'au-
thority in'the-grantor to make it. In rejecting testimony to thesepoints, the Circuit Court erred; and their judgment must be reversed, and the cause remanded for
a new trial.

The Court below ought not to have rejected the tes-

If the witness bad testified thit a survey fiad neen actually made' and that it included the creek, it would have been admissible testimony. But the' plat was intended th be a substitute for an actud hurvey. It was a -part 6f tile. patent; annexed to it and referred t. by it. -Itwas as much a part of the patent as.if it had been insertedin it. It shows that the laid ought be laid if" so as to inrlude the creek, as p niuly as ifthe patent had -eWpressed it in words. Th cnrse, squth AO degrees :West, is ambiguous-it may mean a maghetic or a meri-
dional course. The question is whatvag theorntention of the surveyor? How shall it be ascertained? The most direct mode of ascertaing it is to prove! his ddclarAtions .tthe time. It is true that by proving what was
the general practice of surveyors you mtvy infer his intention-but that.is a secondary mode',of proof, *andless &ertainthan proof of his declarations at the time he made. the particular survey in question. This is not-bringing parol evidence to contradict or to control the plat, but to corroborate and confirm it.

The general practice of tie country is to survey by the compass, and ll the courses expressed in surveys refer tj the magnetic meridian. A certificate of survey therefore is always supposed to express magnetic courses unless the contrary is expressed on its face. No parol proof can be admitted to contradict what is so strongly implied. It would be a dangerous practice-it would. be a difficult thingIor a common surveyor to ascertain the true meridian, and there is no I \v of North Carolina which compels him to do it. The testimony offered vas not to prove any act of the surveyor, but his intentions.
There is no natural boundary called for in the patent, The general expression'that the land is on Crow Creek, cannot control the course and distance. The expression in the patent ",as by the plat hereunto annexed will appeal;," refers only to the courses and distances, and not to the actual location of the land. The figure of a creek delineated on the plat, without any reference to it in the certificate of survey, catinot control the boundaries actually described. Not a word is said' about the lines including or crossing Crow Creek; and' in order to include the creek you must deviate from the straight line called for.
C. LEE, in reply.
The intent of a grant must be effectuated, if by ani means, consistent "withthe rules of law, it can' be done. The intent of this grant cannot be' effectuated by the mode of survey directed by the Court below. The plat4 annexed to thegrant, shows the intent to be to make the -survey conform t,) the nature of the grfind so as to i. elude the.creek and the valley, and exclude the moun' tains. The law of North Carolina requires thoplat to, b6 ann.exed to the deed. which is thereby, and by tho reference to it in the body of the deed,- made .a part thereof; and contains a plain .declaration that thw granj tee shall have the valley through which the creek.runs;

On what ground could the testimony of the intention MzivEr's of thesurveyor, have been rejected by the Court, when xzssr they admitted testimony to show the general -practice V. to be to survey by the magnetic meridian,2 That general WALx LU& practice was only a factfroin which thejury mightinfer, in ANOTLEU. the absence of positive testimony, what the intent of the surveyor was. It was a grade of evidence inf-ri-r to positive testimony of the intention. It was only prima facie, not conclusive evidence of his meaning. There was no law of North Carolina which required the surveyor to go by the magnetic, and not by the true meridian. He was at full liberty to adopt the true meridian if hepleased. We say he did so, and the plat itself isevidence-of the fact; for it could not otherwise be consistent with itself. You must run the lines according to the true meridian to include the creek.
Does not a difficulty arise in consequence of the grant having been made without actual survey?
C. LEn.. That is a matter between the state and t.e grantee. After a grant, no stranger can take advantage of such a defect. The state may wave the objection if it chuses to do so.
SwANN. Ithas been settled, I believe in North Care lina that when a grant has actually been made, n,- enquiry shall be made by the state as to the survey, &c.

bounded by the courses and distances of the patent, ac cordingtb the magnetic meridian. Bat it is a general principle that the course and distance must yield to nainral objects valled° for.in the patent. All lands are supposed to be actually surveyed,, and the intention of
tihe grant is to convey the land according to that actual survey ; consequently if marked trees and marked cur,
ners be fouinid conformably to the calls of the patent, or if water-courses be called for in the patent, or mountains or any other natural objects, distances must be length-
ened or shortened, and courses varied so as to conform
to those objects.

The reason of the rule is. that it is the intention, of the grant to convey the land actually surveyed, and mis-
takes in courses or distances, are more probable :and more frequent" thau in marked trees, mountains, rivers or other natural objects caiable of being- clearly desig-
nated and accurately described. Had the survey in this case, been *actually made, and the lines had called to
cross Crow Creek, the courses and distances might have been precisely What they are, it might have been
impracticable to find corner or other marked trees antl yet'the, land must have been so sni'veyed as to include
Crow Creek. The call, in the lines o' the patent, to
cross Crow Creek, would be one to which course and distance must necess'irily yield. This material call is mi~ted, an,] from its omission arises the great difficulty of the cause.

That the lands- should not be described as lying on bath sideq of Crow Creek, ni the lines call 11or crossing
that creek, ar such extrordinary omissions as tocreate consid-rabl- doubt with tho Court in dridinq whether tere is any. other descril)tion given, in the patent, of s.iTi ient strength to control the call fop course and distance.

This would prbve, notwithstauding the error in. the course, that the lands pn both sides of Crow Creek were intended to beixicluded in'the,survey, and intended to be granted by the patent.

It is the opinion of the majority of this Court, that there is'error in the opinion of the Circuit Court Vir the district'ofEastTennessee in this, that 0 c said C ult .instructed thejury that the grant, under which the Plaintiff claimed, could not be legally run so as to include
Crow Creek, instead of directing the jury that the said grant must be o run as to* include Crow Creek, and to conform as near as may be to the plat annexed to the said grant; wherefore it is considered b) this Court that the said judgment be reversed and annulled and the cause be remanded to the said Cirpuit Court that a new trial may be had according to law.

The chief justice, added, that lie did unot think the question about 'the true meridian had much to.do with the case. The Cburt decided it upoi the plat. If it had not been for the plat, they should have said thatthe land ought to be gurveyed by the magnetic meri.

pealed to this Court.

&orRRS,

The peculiar state of titles to land in Kentucky, a senior patent iseing, in many cases, issuef. oza a junior
title, and it bein. a rqle in their Courts of law not to look beyond the patent, have settled the principle that
.Courtsof equity will sustain a bill brought for the purpose of establi-ihin the prior title by entry, and of ob-
taiing a convei ance from the person holding under a senior pateht issued on a junior entry. The Courts a the United Staits-have conforined to this practico, ana 4dopted the principle.

It is also settled in Kentucky that, between pre-emption rights; the prior improveipent will hold tile lala, although the certificate if the commissioner, tile entry;
the survey and -the patent, be all posterir, in point nf time, to those obtaied by the person w6 has manoe au improvement of a latei date.

It follows, from thebe established principles, that Finh-y must prevail, uuless"he has loSt the right acquired in consequence of his improvement.

The Circuit judge was of opinion that this right ws lost-by the form of his entry with the surycvor. Not having, in that.entry, called, in terms, for his improvement, that judge was of opinien that, although his entry dots. in faat, comprehend his .bnprovememit, *yet he has surrendered the pr'eference -which his pre-6mption warrant gave-him, and sunk his claim to the level of a com-
mon treasury warrant. Tfiis Court can perceive no reason for that opinion. The law requires'that tbe en-
try shall, in fact, include the improvement, but does
Dot make it essential to the Aignity of the entry that the"improvemgnt shall, in terms, le called for. The cer-
tificate expressly states that the land granted is to inclide the improvement; and the entry, wldch is made with remarkable piecision, conforms exactly to the cer-
tificate in the description of 'the land intended to be
taken.

SUPREME COURT U. S.

FllqLEy "But itis contended by the Defendant tfj~t, whatever
T. may be the opinion of the Court on this point, Finley's WILLIA.IS title as to a pre-emption, must'yield to that of Lynn, in &OTIIERS. consequence of his having omitted to assert his claim
before the Court of commissioners. The legislature could not, it is said, after permitting the time for making this claim to e.Npirc, revive it t th e prejudice cf any other person who had ncquired title to the land. 'It is added that the decisions in Kentucky have bce), adverse to -Litles to pre-cmptions depending on certificates granted by the county Courts, in cases where they cone into competition with titles gained before the grant of' such certificates.

This Court would not willingly depart from the state decisions, ifrthey have settled the principle the one way
or the other; and would, therefore, have deferred the determination of this cause until more certain informna.tion could be obtained, had it rested solely on the validity of the Plaintiff's title as founded 'Ol a lre-etuption.' But, on an inspeetion of the record, tile entry of
the Defendants is deemed so radically defective ag necessarily to 3'ield to the title of the Plaintiff, should his warrant even be reduced to the grade of a treasury
warrant.

The law requires that the holder of a land warrant ,,"shall direct the location thereof so specially and pre.. ,"cisely as that others may be enabled with certainty to 4 locate other warrants on-the adjacent residuum."

Such has been the difficulty of making special loca. tions, that much of the precision wxhich the law Nould seem to require, has been dispensed wih ; hut a reason. able and practicable certainly has always been dmend
necessary; and Nherever the material and principal call of a location has been calculated, inste.ad of infrill.
ing to misguide subsequent locators,. tle location itself has been brought iit- hazard, and] it has often been deterjined that the survey was made on other laud than
that which the entry covred.

In examining thes questions. the Courts of Kentucky have universally and properly determined that all
subordinate calls in an entry must yield to a principal

.all t' which they may be relhlgnant. If a great and rL.E prominate object, immoveablc and durable in itself, and V. of general notoriety, be called for iin a location, that oh- wi .IAstg ject must fix and locate the entry, although other minor &owriU s. and temporary objects, to he discovered only by a stvrict
and successful search, might prove that the locator re-
ally intended to take other land.

In the entry of Lynn and others there is such a principal call. The Big Blue Lick is perhaps an object of as universal notoriety as any in Kt ntu: ky, But there are two Blue Licks on the same creek, and both of them are large licks. In such a case, the locator would cer-
tainly be at liberty, and it 'would he his duty to designate the lick he intended to take; for if his entry would apply to the one as well as to the other, it would be justly i hargeable with a vagueness which would leave sub-
sequent locators unable to locate with certainty the adjacent residuum. This entry has, in its terms, designated the lick intefidel to be included. It is c, the Big
Blue Lick." The entry'does not call for a Big Blue Lick, but for the Big Bite Lick, thereby excluding any
other lick than that which was emphaticQly denomiun-
ted ,t Big Blue Lick,

We are then to ask which of these licks a man in Kentucky# holding a warrant which lie intended to locate, would suppose was the. Big Blue Lick.

Upon-this subject the testimony is not doubtful. it
is in full liroof that, at the time the entry of the Defen-
dants was made, and for some years before, the Lower Bhme Licks were generally called the Big Blue Licks; and that where the Defendants have surveyid 'was known by the name of the Upper Blue Licks. They were sometimes, though rarely, distinguished from earit
other as the Upper Big Blue Licks and the Lawer Big Blue Licks; sometimes as the Upper and t0 Lower
Blue Licks; but the term the Big Blue Licks, when. used vithout the word ii upper" or 6,lower," was universally understood to designate the Lower Blue Licks°

The comparty which e this location in 1775, had

not discovered the Low.d..ue Licks, and therefore de-

Big Blue Lick 2' but the name originated and expired with themselves. It was never adopted b'y. the peoplq of the country. It is probabile that Lynn did contemplate the Upper Blue Licks when he made his entry; but be-
tween conflicting entries a mistake of this kind is fLtal to the person who commits it. In the case of Taytor and Hughes it wai impossible not to perceive that Taylor intended one creek when he named, another.; but subsequent locators iould judge of his intention only from the words of his entry.

But it.is contended that there are other explanatory calls in the entry, which cure the defect which has been stated, and designate, with suffi'ient certainty, that'the Upper Blue Lick was intended to ha included in the entry.

The entry is said to require a lick on the soutl side of Lickiig;'and the sprig which isiu(.s at the Upper Blue Lick is on the. south side. The words are, " Beccginning one quarter of a mile below the Big Btue
",Lic on Licking, on the south side thereof'" The locater intends,to describe his beginning; and these
-words are to-bo congtrued with reference to that 'inteiltion. lQo the words, con Licking," describe the plaeo of beginning, or the location of the Big Blue Litk? 'The latter was unnecessary, because there was no Big Blue Lick except on Licking; and because, were the fact otheruise, the lick would be asc~rtained by calling for a be-inning a quarter of a mile helow it onLtcking. But.the b.ginning might be a quarter of a mile below the lick, and yet not on the creek. The beginning would be, in some degree, uncertain, unless it be fixed by thsose words. The entry is understood as if it were expressed thus: ",Beginning on Liking, on the south sido theieof, a quarter of'a mile below the Big Bio Lick." If reference bp had to thb certificate granted by the commissioners, that places the land, notithe lick, on the south side of the creek.

A cabin and a marked tree in a country full of cabins and marked trees, cannot control a call made for an ob*ect of such gene.r:l notori:'ty as; the Big Blue Lick. A subsequent locator would look for them only at the Big Blue Lick-

These eumstanzes zendcr it unnecessity for the Court to ex. pre-s an opinioa as to the description of persos contemplated tobe relieved by the act ofthe Virginia legislature wshich passed in bMny,1781.
The Defendants derive their title under an entry made the CU of June, "178-,in the words following, to wa: -'Wiliasi Lyin, James Br-baur and "John Williams enter 1000 acrs upon a pre-emption warrant, beginnin"one quarter of a mile below the Big Blue Li-k en Licking, on the =1uti

The important call in ite entry of the Defadnts is "the Big Blue U&ck VCon Licking, on the south side tereof."

The validity of this entty rests on the following points: Was the lick,de. scribedin the connected platfileidnthis-suitbythe name of theBluel~ck, on the 22d day of June, 1780, and prior to that time generally known and called by the name of "1the Big Blue Lick ?" Does it lie on the south satl of Licking? Is it a big lick? If the lick was i t otaur iuly knbwn by the name of the It Big Blue Lickt" prior to June, 1780, isthe identity ther'eof0 described as to put a subsequent locator on his guard?

in the entry

All the witnesses in the cause speak of- the lick in question as being ablato Jick, and it is so admitted by the parties who, in their admission, represent the
salt waterissuing from the spring tobe of a bluish color. There is no testi-
snny which proves the existqnce of any Blue Lick on Licking, except thu "Uppef and Lower Blue Licks. The testimony establishes two salt Springs on the south side of Licking; tfat the one lowest down is less than the upper spriig; that there is another salt spring on the north side of Licking, at the place called the Lower Blue Licks, which is larger than that on the sonth side ofthe sti'ean; and that there is no salt spring on the north ite of Licking opposite the tipper lick. The witnesses also, when s'pe' aking of the lower Salt spings, describe them generally as one entire object, the Lower Blue
Lick or Licks; and William Brooks describes both the'Uppetl and Lower
Blue Licks as big licks, and that the upper spring discharges mostt water.

The Courts in this country have always endeavored to sustain an entry, it by reasonable construction it be poss ble For this purpoe they will reject an absutrd or superfluous call: they will supply a word: they will consider a call not proved as expunged; and althongh there are Miore allegations than are plared, yet if enough is proved to reoder the entry suffleigntly certain, the Court will support it.

These observations are made to show that the Courts will go great lerths

to support defective entries in imperfectand unimportant calls, and are not ap-

p icable to the entry nnw tunder consideration, which, in itselc, is consilercil

as possessing sullicient identity to put a subsequent locater npon enquiry, and

when found, to know the place by-the description entained in thu entry.

as the year 1777. The Lower Hkie Licks, although there were at that plac

cd that the collector proceeded to collect the taxes due on the said land in the manner prescribed by law for collecting taxes due upon lands where the owner resides thereon, and not in the manner prescribed when the owneri are non-residents and because there is a va-

JoN.s, for the Plain4ifin error.

There is only one question in this cause, viz : whe. flier the collector, in making sale Of the land under the
13th section of the 'act, (vol. 4. p. 213) was bound to publish for 60 (lays in I gfazettes of the state, the co-
pies of the lists of the lands taxable, &c. with a statement of the amount of the taxes due thereon, and a notification to pay the same in 30 days, as required by the 11th section of the same act.

We contend that thjis clause of tixe section applies
only to itnoccupied lands of irnkizown "proprietors, and not merely to lands of nton-residents., Grant, although a non-resident, was a known proprietor.

Such publication is only necessary in case of distress anil sale of goods and chattels, which is th. only remedy given by the lith section. If the collector intended
to lery the distress, then it was incumbent on hint 'to make the publication. But when tie legisl'ature, by the
13th section, giv the reniedj by sale of the land itself, they make a different provision and require difflrehb notice of the sale. and do not refer to the provisions
of the 11th section ; all of which proi isions relate only to the case of distress.

FEBRUARY TEI I815.

C. LEE, contra.

AinLn

The deed from the collector must always recite all It%'s the facts necessary to make the title good. In this re- xESSEE. spect the deed is very defective.

The land appears to have belonged to a non-resident. Xf his residence was known, the law rcquired that he should have personal notice: if not knownk,, he must have presumptive notice by publication as the i1th section requires. It cannot be supposed that the law would
require less notice to authorize a sale of the laiul, than
a distress and sale of chattels. It cannot he siupposeul that the legislature meant to comprise all the pre-requisita-s of a sale of the land in the 13th section; for that section applies as well to residents -s to non-residents, and yet it requires no notice -ofthe amount of th6 taxes
nor ;.demand of payment before sale. It is rather to be presumed that the legislature meant that all the preceding requisites should be complied with.

It is not necessary that the deed should recite any oi

the facts preceding the sale. They may all be proved

The mode, of proceeding with respect to non-resident.f is prescribed in the iith qnd 13th sections of the act imposifig the direct tax.

It is alleged'that the. Plaintiff below did not entitle himself to the provisions- of this section by bringing bimself within its description. He was a non.resdent ani bad no known agent, but has not shown that there
was no occupant of the land.

_The testimony offered by both Plaintiff and Defendant is spread upon the record; and although the Plaintiff has not shown that there was no occupant, yet that fact came outin the testimony of the )efendant before the opinion of the Court was given. One of the tax li4sts pro luced by him stat6o the land to be without an occupant; and the other which states John Grant to be the. occupant, is sofar.disproved, because the case admitq Sohn Grant to have been, at the time, an inhabi-
tant of Kentucky without any agent in the state of Ten-
nessee.

The requisites of the 13th section of the act, which pre.scribes the course to be pursuW4 where lands are to be sold because the ttxes are in arrear and unpaid for
twelve mbnths, have been observed. "The reqoisites of the 11th section, which prescribes the duty of the, Iollector after the assessment of the tax before lie cai proceed to distrain for it, have not been observed. The cause depends on this'single point-was it the duty of the collecto, previous to selling the lands of a non-residen, in the 7panner prescribed by the 13t1 section of the act to make the publications prescribed in the 11th
section ?

This will require a consiaeration df the spirit and intent of the law.

The 1ith section prescribes the duty of the coliector with respect to lnds, &c. not owned, &c. by some person within the colb::ction district wherein the same shall be situated.

Upon receiving lists of such lands, &c lie is to transmit certified copies thereof to the surv! yors of the revenue of tire assessment districts, respectively, within
which such persons respectively reside, whose, duty it is to give personal notice of the claimi to those who are liable f:,r it. If the tax shall not be paid within a specified time after this notice, it then brcumes the duty of the collector to collect the same by distress.

If lie residence of the owner of sueh land be unkndwn, this sectimn-requires certain publications to be nitle .as a substitute for personal notice; after which it is the duty of the collector to proceed to colkeot the tax by distress in like manner as where apersonal demand has

Th. 13th section prescribes the duty of the colibctor. and the forms to be obseeved in the sale of land the taxes on which remain. unpaid for one year. This section contains nb reference 'o those which preceded it,
but marks oi-t the course of the collector in the.speciflc case. It is therefore contended, and the argunent h-wgreat weight, -that if the requisites of this section be

z.Pssa., T'her6 is, throughout the act, an obvious anxi,,ty in the legislatur46 to avoiM coerciye mean4 of collection, tnless such means should be necessary ; and to gve every owner of lands the most full inibrmation of the sum or which he was liable, and to affoid him the most easy opportunity to pay it. Thus the accruing of fhe tax is to be advertised, and the times and places at which the colleto' will attend to receive it. A personal demand at the dweiling houses of those who have neglected to
attend to this notice must then be made, a, reasonable time before tihe collector can collect the tax by diste'ess. Where lands are own'ed by non-residents whosi places of residence ar: known, this personal notire is still required ; and where their residence is unknuwn, certain ptiMieations are, substittited"for and deemed, equivalent -to personal notice amid demand., in each case, it is .Made the duty of the collector to 1proced to collect the tax by distress and sale.

From this view of the law it is inferred, not only flint the legislature was anxious to avoid coerciye means of
co!lection, but has also manifested a solicitude to colli-ct the tax by distrss and sale of personal property rather than by a sale of the land. its'l. That all the means of cohlettion prescribed in the act must have beentied, and inst have failed before a sale -of the land can ble atnade. The duty of 'the'collector to make a pi rsonal demqnd froin the resident owner of lands, and to make those pobliciations which the law substitutes for a per-
sonal demand where the residence of the oswner is nknown, does not deipend on the Iact that ppi-sonial pro.
pertiv, is or is not on the land Frain which Ifie tax miy be hytied by distress. Itis his duty to proceed in the
manner prescribed in the 9th and 11th sections, in every case. After having so proceeded; it N his pesitive duty
to levy the tax by distress, if pr,spert. liable to distress canbe found. If, notwithstanding the proceedings directed in the 9th and I Ifli s:,ctions; the tax shall renmtsir one year unpaid, it is to be raised by a sale of the lomd,
It appears to the Court that the 1.3th section pre-. upposdseverv thing vjointd in the 9th and tth sections to have been porfornxtd, and that the validity of tho

sale of land owvned by a non-resident, made by the collet.tor for the nrn-payment of taxes must depend not only on his having made the publications required in the 13th section, but on his having made those also which are required in the lith section. Those publications not having been made in this case, it is the opinion of the majorit) of this Court that tue sale is void, and that the judge of the District Court committed no error in givin. this instruction to the jury.

At the trial of the cause, the Plaintiffs produced and read in evidence, a patent from the commonwealth of
Virginia, granting certain lands therein dcscribed i ing
in the county of-Nelson, in the now state of Kentucky, to John May, John Banister, Kennon Jones, Thotnas Shore and Christopher 'IConico, He then offered in evidence the last will and, testament of John May. tie.
ceased, which contained this clause, ,,I give and devise ,,my land to my executors, herein after named, and to " the s·urv"ivor"sOand surviw- of such of them as may act,
and their heirs, for the purpose of selling as much there-
" of as will pay all my debts."

This will was proved and admitted to record according to the laws (if Virginia, while Kentucky was a part of that state, and is duly certified by the.proper authority. The Plaintiff., Ann Lewis, (wire of the other Plaintiff, Thomas Lewis.) who was an executrix named in the wilf of theasaid John Wlity, alone qualified as executrix, and took upon herself the burthen of executing the said
will; but she did not 'qualify, and. did not obtain her let-
ters testamentary mnhtil After Kenturky had become an
independent state.

The counsel for the Defe'ndants, objected to the admissibilitv of the will and certificate thereto sisbjoins d, because the said Ann hd only qualified, and sued out letters testamentary in the state of Vit.ginia, and not'in
the state of Kentucky where the land lies. Tte Court sustained the objection, and the will was not permitted to go in evidence to the jury. To this opinion an exception was taken. There was also a secand exreption ta-
ken on the same rRjection of evidence, which depends
entirely on the correctness of the first opinion, and there.
fore need not be particularly stated.

It has been decided in this Courtthat letters testamen.
tary give to the executor no authority to sue for the personal estate of the testator out of the jurisdiction of
the power by which those letters are granted. But this decision has never been understood to extend to a suit for lands. devised to an executor. In such case the cxe-
cutor sues as devisee. Hi'. right is derived from the will, and the letters testamentary do not give the title The executors are trustees for the purposes of the will.

FEBRUARY TERII i 115.
This will may be consio1ered as requiring that the exe- DoE, cutai s shall 'actto enable thmsvlv s to t.ke under the z.Essun or devise to-them ; but when the conditio is performed, LEwIs & those who have performed it, take under the %ill. That wiF. the executrix took upon herself that character after the T. separation of Kentucky from Virginia, is of no conse- mcpxunquence. When she did take it upon herself. the condi- MAND tiun on which the devise was made, %ias performed, and &OTnEnsi she took as devisee undt r the will ; and the act consummating hlr title, had relation to the time of its commenceInent, which was before the separation of the two states. "Wereit even necessary, which is-not admittedi to record this will in Kentucky, that objection was not made to the instrument, and therefore the Court cannotsuppose it to exist. The will was rjccted because the ex(cttrix had not qualified in Kentucky, and this objection is not deemed a valid one.
An objection was also taken to a deed, which wwq orfered in evidence, on the ground of an all6geid variance between it, as proaf, and the allegations in the declaration. 'The deed was not permitted top).in evidence to the jury; arid to this opinion, also, an excepti'n.was taken.
The variance is not pointed out. If the objection to the deed is, that it conveys only an undivided intrest,3 while the declaration clainis the whole tract, the objection ought not to have been sustain.ed ; but on the propriety of rejecting the deed it is not nacemsary to give an opinion, since the judgment must be rccrsed on the first point.
1adgment reversed, and the cause. remanded wifl directions to grant a new trial and to permit the will to be read in evidence.

want of proper grantees, it remained in the king, the grantor. (as if one hall of the names inserted had been fictitious) and at the i'evoaution vested in tile state of Vermont.
The nature of the estate intended to be conveyed, is expressed in the word cglebe" well known in the Engliqh law, as a provision for the par'son of a parish. The law says that the freehold only vests in the reg-1Iar parson ; not'the fee: coqseqiiently the grant or disposition of land, in such case, for a globe, does not mako or imply a disposition of the fee; the fee, therefore, remains in the grantor.

The words " for a glebe for the church of EDgidnd as by la76 established," expiress clearly the intention of the
grant, viz: tor the SUpport and extonsion of the national church, considertd in its political connexion. It is not a grant to the national church as a body. No such grant over was made, or if made, would be valid. Every prevision for its support is to some organ of the
church. as to the bishop of such A see, or the phrson of such a.parish. and his successors. A parish church, in
the English law, is the building consecrated and endowed. There must be a glebe, which may be the church yard only. Th'e parson has, in the glebe, no more than a freehold estate. He'is considered in'law as a solo cor-
poration, and the freehold passes by succession. Parighes are a civil and ecclesiastical division; the inhabitants of a parish, the parishioners, the members of the .national chuich) are never said to be members of the pa~ish church; neither the parishioners nor the vestry have any right in.. or power -over the glebe, not even during a vacancy, (See I Black. page 117.) The chtrch of England-never was established by law, either in Now Hampshire or Vermont, before orsince. the revolution. Neit!ter the civil nor ecclesiastical law, as applicable to globes, was, known or recognized at the
date of the charter; nor as it been adopted or rec ognized since in either of those states. he intention of the erant, ther -fore, even before the revolation, dodd never have been carried int. ef,'ct. Itis also well knoVn that, at the date of the charter, the land therein granted was a wilderness, and so continued for a long
time afterwards.

At the time of the grant, tlier,'fo'e, there was not only THE

.Thegrant, of course, could not take Jfect; and tI e &oTIER. revolution has rendercd it utterly impossible that it ever can take effect agreeably to th intenlion of the donor.
By the revolution we have bec'ome cowpletel. s.ered from the church or England as by law cstablish;i d. In-
dividuals and scieties may p isse~s the same land. have the came mode of worship, and tie same ordinances adniuistered in the same mann.r, and suhnit to the smne discipline, as far as may be eflficted with,,ut the assistance of the civil arm. But thi.- constitutes, in the view we are now taking of the. sabject, similffari,.not idenity.
It fornishes9 no ground for legal dcrivttion ul' (ivil or legal connexion. In every political, civil and l.gal view, and in a!l tie civil and legal consequences, the
dissolution or the church of England, as by law establistied, was in the United S'ates as total and coiap!ete on the rev.kition, as that of the civil power of the British goverument. Nor has there ever been in lhe state. of VerniQnt, a subsUtute adopted. Evry idea of a national or qtate religion has been exploded. The Cu.t will consider how many things are requisite to the legal possession and enjoyment of a glebe; how much of the common law of England, and how mu'h of the cannon
law must be adopted or considerewas in force; although, in every civil and politial view, the inilitution or establishment to which they applied is abolished. There must be. a parish. a church with cure, a parson, legally
and canonically introduced-four things are requisite to constitte, a parson; I. 1oly orders: 2. Preintaim or Collatio ; 3. Institution; 4. Induction; lie mrist be a sole corporation. No part of the common lam, on this sul'ject has been adopted in the state of Vermont; either by the comstitution, by statute, or by legad adjudications.

It would be absurd to consider any number of Epis. copalians, formed into a society inVermont, as staidingia

the place of a parish, and capable. contrary to the doc.

holding by succession or otherwise, by or under a grant of lands for a glebe, made by tie king of. Great Britain
before the revolution. There is a statute in Vermont, (see an act for the support of the gospel, passed in 1707p, Revised Laws, Vol. 2, page +74) under which religious societies may be formed ; but it does not appear, in the case, that tile society in the ,toWn of Pawlet is formed under that act. But, if so formed. the members of such society arc'not confined to anty particalar limits, and if associated from 4, or 5 different towns, they may have a claim eqtually good to the gh'be lands, in each t6wn. This statute, which extends equally to all denominations of Chri.tiauis, constitites societic or associations forineil under it, corporatibons or quasi corporations; and enacts, ",That they shall have power to hold to "6thenmselves and successors, all surh estates and into",rests, as they may hereafter acquire. by pur-hase or
"otherwise, and the same to s'l and transfer, for the "benefit of. such association," A society so formed, has th: pecise power given by "the.act and no other. The, power is limited to future acquisitions; the power to sell is .co-extensive %vith Ih- pnwer of acquisition. Noting is to be holden which shall be perpetually, appropriated, as a glebe is. Such society is not empow. cied to succeed to estates, riglts or interests, granted prievious to their existence, although limited to objects similar to its own.- Indeed tle expression in the act seems to have intended an exclusion of such claim.

If the share in question si-ould be considered as a re-
servtion foi- a f-tue paricuhir use, it then reinained'itt

It, of course, remained in the king at fhe rvvolu:ion, and at that time vested in the state of Vermont.

At tle-date of this charter a separation of the provinces or colonies from the mother country vwas not

&OT1Itns.

If the share in question be considered, in the nature of a grant, then, as we have before stated, the grant of "6a gkvbe," if it took effect at all, is of the freehold only, and not of the fee; of the freehold to be taken and held by the incumbents in succession.

The fee, of course, not being granted, remained in the grantor. By the English law, as well as our own, on the dissolution or political death of a corporation, all estates granted to such corporation revert to the grantor
or donor. And if a grant was made by the king to any person, or number of persons, incapable of taking or holding, or if the object ceased to exist, or never came
into existence, the estate was considered as never having passed, or as reverting to the king, according to the nature of the case.

On the revolution tie state of Vermont, as a sovereign state, succeeded, in full and sovereign riglt, to
all the property and rights.f property within the same, which, at the time, were vested in or appertained to the king .of Great *Britain, whether in possession or reversion. The cask-, then, stands thus; a tract of land in the town of Pawlet was, by the king of Great Britain, before the revolution granted ",for a glebe for the
6c church of England, a-.by law established ;" that is, thefreehold to -vestto a particularuse, when thit use .,hould
arise, the remainder or reversion in the crown. There is no securing, in the constitution of Vermont, to any
man or body of nn, of any rights or benefits, which
under th e crown were intended for the church of England as by law established. At the time of the revolttion there had Aever bedh, within the territory, now state, of Vermont, a regudarparson, who could make any possible legal claim or pretence to the use of any of the glebe lands within the same. The sole corporation, as
the parson was denominated, was not disiulved or exfinguished by a political death, because in Vermont it

SHiEPHERD, contra.
It is contended by th counsel for the Plaintiff that nothing passed by the grant contained in the charter or Pawlet; go as to divest the king of Great Britain of the title to the premises in question. IfIthi position is correet, it must be admitted that the Plaintiff is entitled to recover; because it cannot be denied that the title of the crown to any. lands anti-cedent to the revolution, within the jurisdiction of the now state of Vermont, would of course become the property of the state. If, however, the ground taken by the Faintilff's coun-As, shall be found untenable, and that fir title of the king was div. ited by the grant; then, whether the Defendants have a title or not, wvill he a matter of indifference; so long as the Plaintiff,; must recover on the strength of their own title, and not on the weakness of ours.
If, by the grant, the fitle passed from th,. then king, the state or Vermont could acquire no right by the revolution ; but the title must remain, unless forfeited, as at the time of the grant.
The reason given by the counsel for tAe .Plainfiff to show that, notwithstanding the -charter,' tl:e title renained ;n the grantor is. that when made, there w'as no .grante in esse capable of taking the foe, or other estate, so as to divest the king of his. If this be true, 6n a fair construction of the letters pat,-ot, it must also be admitted that the Plaintiff is entitled to judgment.
it is believed that, on examination of the'charter, the Count will be of opinion that there was a sufficient grantee in esse; and that the title did pass by that instrurheiit And if there was then, no matter wljat h'ls

1. The words of the granting clause are, "cDo give "v., cand grant in equal shares, unto our toiing sublects, in- D. cLAr "haJbitants ofNew Hampshire, and our.othergovemens, &OTHELS. 64 and to their heirs and assigns forever, uwho xames are

" entered on this grant, to be divided to andanimonPtthem, - into sixty-eight equal shares, all that tract, or parcel of "land. 4-." describing and bounding the Whole town-
ship of Pawlet.

It is contended hers that the whole of the land, contained within th;3,boundary lines of the township, was .designedto be granted without any saving or regervation to the crown, of any part of the same. The
whole of the six miles square was granted; to whom? To the loving subjects, of his majesty in New Hampshire and elsewhere. How was it granted? In fee sim-
ple; and in sixty-eight equal shares, to be equally divided to, and amongst the king's loving subjects named on the grant.

He granted to them (he they more or less in number) the whole township of Pawlet as tenants in common,
and not in severalty. Hence, each man named on the
grant became entitled to his proportionable jart of the whole township, whether he was one of sixty-eight, or
one of three.

It is presumed the Court in this case will be much inclined to do, as Courts have generally done, if possible by their construction to satisfy the object of the grant,
an.d give it a meaning which was intended by the graator. It is a-rule of construction to search out the intention, and make-that a land mark.

Possessing liberal views of this instrument,, it will no doubt he found that the grantor designed to pass*the title to the whole town of Pawlet; to his loving sub-
jects named thereon, and not to confine the grant to a .sixty-eighth part of the township to each, but ii proportion to-thewhole number, more or less.

tXow, supposing that a part of the naies. written on

1) ULARK
&OTIIER5. Fictitious persons could not be loving subjects; therefore the whole, land would pass to the real persons. Most, iinquestionably the whole tract was granted to those capable of taking a title.
It will be seen by the grant, that the lands werd not allotted, of course no partition was made amongst tho patentees until after the charter was made. The grant was in common and not'in severlidty ; therefore nd inference of an intention to give each proprietor bilt a single share an be drawn from, the circumstance of the whole town being required to be divided into sixty-eight equal shares. As well might the bounsel contend that it was inferrable from a law incorporating a bank with three thousand shares that the stockholders could havb but one share each.
If the foregoing is a correct construction of the instrument before the Court, then it results as a certain inference that the crown had not a rood of land remaining in Pawlet; and, consequently, the state of Vermont could have none; as' the state pretends to po greater right or title than that of the king.
2. It will be attempted to be slown that on the 26th day of August, 1761, there was in ase a church of England, as by law established, which could be a granteo of the crown., If so, the title passed directly to the church in foe simple; and would need no auxiliary to sustain her right.
It is said by the counsel that lands granted for the benefit-of the church, arbgranted to the bishop, or some other ecclesiastical person ; but it would be strange doctrine to say that the king had not power to grant di. rectly to the church established hv law; and therefore distinctly identified as a Christian society. The position will here le ventured, that such a grant to the chudch of England as by law "established wasp and still i's valid.

FEBRUARY TERM 8i.

To maintain the point that the church existed at the THE

date of the grant, we need only appeal to historical facts TOWN oF

in tie English books, and the still mkee authentic testi- pAWLET

mony of the body, of the English law, the statutes and V.

adjudgea cases of the realm, within the recollection, and n. CL&.M

familiar to the mind of the Court

&OTHERS.

It is said "; that when the grant was made there was no church in Pawlet' it was all new. There was no established church in New Hampshire or New York." Whether true or not, as it respects this part of the argument, is not worth enquiry; for it will be remembered that the words of the'grant do not confine the bounty of the sove-reign to Pawlet, New Hampshire, or the American continent: it is co-extensive with his do.minions, and-may he -claimed by. the church wherever found xvithik them.

That there was a church established by law in Great Britain no-one will deny: if so, what shoulad prevent that church from being the grantee ? IIf can hardly b
denied that the king could grant lands lying in one of liis American colonies to his subjects beyond the Atlantic, as effeztually as those who resided in that colony. It was all within his territorial jurisdiction ; and place of residence could have no 'influence. It may be said
that the grant, is to the king's sulbjects in, New Hamp,shire. True; bit the words ",and our other governme t" are added. .These words. may embrace the whole governments pnd dominions of his majesty.

If, however. this ground should fail us- there can be no difficulty, it is presumed, to ascertain the existence of a church in the colonies capable of taking a title to the propetty in question.

In ,Virginia, if information is correct, the Episcopalian church wag established by milaw of that colony before the date of the grant; but whether so o not, we feel indifferent because by a future construction of the grant, we have the utmost confidence that the true meaning is not a church established by any law in the American colonies, but that the,words - as by law estabMsed, are used as-descriptive of the denomination of
,phristians, initended as the sabjects of royal munificence.

SUPREME COURT U. S.
TR As much as to say that sect of Protestants who alTow* oF known in England as the establish,,d Episcopalian PAwYLET church. That you, churchmen of America, must'em-
T. brace the same creed the same church government ). CLARIC must be the rule of your discipline; and your ordi&OTHE S. nances'must be administered in every respect as by the -,-----.-.-..established church in England. You must be neither
Cathol s nor Desenters, but be identified in every part of your religious establishment in faith and practice with the mother church.
That this is a natural construction is manifest from the fact that the government cotld not have been ignorant of the state of the church in the colonies, and it would bb the height of absurdity to suppose a grant to be made to a body of Christians, which the grantor well knew did not exist. The Court surely will never impute to the officers of any government such triflling and mockery. If, therefore, the colonial Episcopal church was intended as the subject of this bounty, and if she was not established by law, it must follow, as an irresistable inference that the woirds ";as by law established," are words of description and not of identity.
Having established this point, we will show by historical proof a church in. the state of New Hlampshire, long antecedent to the date of thiegeant.
In 'Belknap'shist. of Xcw Hampshire, 2 vol. 118, it is stated that iu the year 1732, a building for. an. Episcopal church was erected at Portsmouth, in New Rampshire. In 1734f the church was consecrated; and in 1736 they obtained a clergyman of that order by the name of Arthur Browne.
If this church was capable of taking a title to land, as I shall hereafter show, all the difficulty suggested on the part of the Paintiff will be removed.
Some reasons will now be giveui to show that surh a clnrch as was-established in New Hampshire was capable of taking a title to, real property.
I. The king, by the act' of gi;anting, creates sufficient corporate powers, to carry into Wefect his designs. That,

FEBRUARY TERTM 18i.
he can create corporations cannot be doubted. He did, T"l, by the very instrumf nt before the Court, create in the TOWN o town of Pawlet all the corporate powe.rs and &er.ga- PAIT T tivws which they now possess; a body sufllciu, tly IV. known in law to be invested with the suppo.-ed legal 1),M:,Afl estate in the premises in question; and by an act of the &OTU-USS very fegislature who have authorized them to bring tis . . action. Ifthe king had the auhoriry to incorp-orate, it can.be easily an:., legally inferr. d fr-in the grant that this body was sufficiently incorporated thereby.
Should congress, by law, give to the Presbyterian thurch of the city of Washington a portion of the public lands, would the Court e-ndure to be.t.ld that thert-, was no proof of the incorporation of the chur i,ergo the law was void-'he title ne er passed either by tle lae or grant made in pursuance thereof?
In a case thus situated, the Court may, indeed they ought to infer, for it is a jus. leJgal deduction, and bottomed upon the sindest juaguient of Iw, that a sovereign, granting power, (always supposed, prima facie at least, to he right) had not indulged in the folish blunders, of granting'real property fonr ost desirable ends, to shadows and non entities. And it isconfidently believed that the Court will determine as a reasmnahle and legal intendment, that the church of.Xew ffampshir. was made capable of holding this property.
There is a further reason to suppose the church capable of taking a title. The grant being a governmental ,act, and of such high and incontrovertible authority, every statement and fact contained in it is so far proved that it cannot be denied. If this be correct, the grant itself proves the whole that need be proved to maka this part of the grant valid, and to vest tile title in the church. The Court, therefore, will not receiv any statements, iistory, conjectures, or Vermont preanibles, to contradict the acts of the British government nade in solemn and official form. It is true that a prior grant from the same authority may be shown to defeat a subsequent. But that is permitted for very different reasonf; because the first act of a government, granting awayits lahds, vests a title in the grantee, nid thore iN not ih. left to give. VOL. ix.

In'support of this position it is submitted, 'whether the words "6one shareas a glebefor the church (f England, tc." are not tantamount to a positive averment of an existing church in this country which could be the legal subject of, donation by letters patent. There is this strong reason to support such an opinion, that we never can impute ignorance or error to a sovereign while exi ercising the high prc.'ogatives of his station. We never can saty that he, as the organ of the government, has
been granting land without a grantee; that be has mis. taken the facts or the law, andt consequently nullify his acts. It is enrugh that the instrument points to the _grantee and gives the object; it6 legal attributes are to be presumed.

The Plaintiff comes, claiming under th6 very title granted to us; in which grant we are acknowledged to
have a prior right Had this grant been from other
than the government on whom thQ doctrine of estppel cannot fasten, it would be enough for us to hold up the
charter between the claim and our possession and shut the Plaintiff at once from even a view of the Court.
Even now, whether the doctrine of estoppel will apply or not,tne thing is true-that what the king, under whmnntA6 Plaintiff claims, has solemnly recognized as
correct must be binding upon the governmetit of Vermont, andA consequently, upon the Plaintiff by this cause.

The act of the 'British government is not the.only governmental act which the church has to secure their
possession.

The l'e,islature of Vermont on the 26th day of October, t787, passed an act .,to authorize the selectmen in the sererat towns of the stale to imnprove the glebe tands,
." And, after enacting that the selectmen sholdl '.have power to Ipase out the glebe lands, receive the rctSt,

By this proviso it is perfectly obvious that the legis- &orinus.

lature intended to manifest a legal recognition or the

ri.ht of the church to the prop,.rty.

It is also equally obvious that by the act authorizing the se.lectmen to talce care of the glebe lots, and obtain possession by action of ejtetment of those which were possessed by squatters, tlhe. leg~slature dh signed not to filch away the land from the church, and in the plenitbde of their power to forget right, but to secure the title and p,omote the interests of the church. Ifnot, why in the proviso are the Episcopal clergy preferred to other cler gy in the management oif the lands; and why are they preferred even to the selectmen as the guardians of the property. The proviso i§ high and indisputable proof that the object of the statute was solely to preserve the property from waste for the benefit of the church, to preserve for it th income which might result from its prudent imanagement, and to save the title from loss by long adverse possession.

After all this, one would suppose that the state Would never indulge itself in attempting to divest the church of their property; yet, strange. as it may appear, on the 30th of October. 1791, the, legislature of Vermont make another act concerning the glebe lots, and the following
is its-preamble :

,Whereas, by the first principles of our government 0C it is cont mplated that all religious s. cts and denomi"nations of Christians, whqse religious tenets are con"sistent with illegiance t the constitution and .govern"ment (ifthis slate, should. receive equal protectiop and I patfonage from the civil ower : And whereas, it is
-contemplated in the grants leretofore .made by'the " British government, comm:nly called glew rights, that - the uses (if the. said rights shiould be to the sole and "cexclusive pupoqe of buildin. up the national religion "of a government diversv from and inconsistent with
-the rights of our oxvn; for which reason. and on the

"oprinciples of the revolution, the property of said landA -- is vestd in this state." They, therefore, go on to
,nact that the rents and profits of all the glebe lots
shall be appropriated to the support of religious wor-
S-alp in their ;:espec;tive towns forever; without' regard to the sect of Christians, and all should share alike, accobrding to the n.imber of taxable inhabitants, in the parishes respectively.

In this preamble they seem to admit that the title to the glebe lots was vested in the church. They do not deny sd1 a construction of the grant, nor do they urge,
s a reason for taking away the propi'rty from the Episcopalians, that tho grant was void, or that, the title was in the drown before the. rev.lutiop; and that thereby they became intitled to the property ; but they say these*
lots were granted or exclusively to build up a national religion of a government diverse from and inconsistent with the rights of their governmeat;" and for these reasons they attempt to divwst the, church of their title
in ord(l to give the property, or the income of it, to
other sects of Christians.

Thp reason given for enacting thiaJaw is strong evi, dence :f the opinifon f'the legislature, that the title had passed out of the crown and vested in the church. But
as they- disliked an established religion, supposed it
anti-republican, and what was more to be dreaded, it Was established in a government "sdiverse f'oi the go-
vernment of Vermont," and inconsistent with their rights, or rather their-religious and political opinions ;-
being disageable in these particulars they tAke away the income of the land from the Epispopalians to appropriate it to other and, no doubt as they supposed, bletter purposes.

Notwithgtandihg the length and force of this pream. ble, and the cogent reasouns given'for making the law, on the fifth day of Nov,,mher, 4799, the legislature repeal this act; and in so doing most manifestly abandbn all pretentions to the churchipropi'rty; for in the ro. pealing law they take care to secure those, who have
trrspa'sed upon those lands, from actions which might be brought for so trespassing :-admitting in the fullest sense that men who had intermeddled with the propert,

FEBRUARY TERM 186.

by the authority and in pursuance of theii law had so TnE trespassed. Hence the Court will see that the legisla- wow, or ture, both in the making and in the repealing of the.law of PANYLET

79-, show that the act was an unjust attempt at usur- V.

pation.

D. cAnK

&OTHERS.
By the record of the case of Pettiboie -. Barber, tried before the late justice Patters!n at a Vermont circuit, it ap,ears that the Plaintiff' failed in an action brouglit in pursuance. of this law. It is said that the juige pronounced the law unconstitutional and void. Thfs decision might have induced the repeal, as the trial was had in the intermediate time between the passage and repeal of the act.

The legislature in the year 1805 passed another acts and by that discover less solicitude for the Christian church in any form. This, to,, has a preamble, contradictipg in its terms the ol, in which, they .say, co Whereas, the several glebe rights, granted by the "British government to the church of England as by "law esta~lished," are in ,, the nature of public reser",vations," they, therefore, give them to the selectmen
of the towns where they lie respectively, for the use of
schools, &c.

The first act contains by implication a decided confirmation of the title in the church. The second, although contradictory 'in its provisions and repugnant to that
right, exhibits in a strikinglightin its preamble and in the repealing clause, a thorough convittion, in the mind.of the legislature, of the fallacy of their pretentionsi urging facts which, if true, would contribute nothing in
support of those pretensions. In the last they urge a new reasonj for their law, and, as we suppose, equally unsound. Here they become wiser, and not only act the legislators but 'judge's, scout ahat had been done by their prvdecessors, and give -a construction of
the grant which is indeed a strange one, but which, if correct, is supposed, as will be hereafter shewn, to defeat the right to recover in this case.

S. In the third place it is supposed the grant of the crown may be considered valid by adopting the opinion that this is one of the'cases wh.re thefee may bein abey-

ance, until 'the existence of the church in the town ot Pawlet, so organized as to be capable of receiving, it.
.To maintain this point the Court are reforred to 2 Blue. Com. OG, 1o. Lit. 342, where it-is laid down, that an estate may be granted to John for life, and t'.'vn to the heirs of Richard, although Richard has no heirs at the time of the grant.

Here, although the life estate vests in John immediately, yet the fee must be in abeyance, until the heirs of
Richard are in esse. Indeed the happening of tho Vvent is perfectly contingent, for those in remainder uay never exist. - Should it be said that the fee remains in the grantor during the life estate, ready to vest in the heirg of Richard if t'iey exist at the determination or the li;fe estate, or to continue. in him by reverter if Richard
has no heirs; it is met by urging thac if this doctrine be correct; then with equal propriety may it be contended on our part, that the fee remained in the king ready to vest, whenever there should be a church.

Rut says the state of Vermont, t,we have a' right by
forfeitue to the king's property." True, but no greater right than the king had ; which was a naked legal title ; the use belonged elsewhere. Of this hereafter.

In the 2 Black. Corn..311, it is said that ecclesiastical estates must sometimes necesgarily be in abcjance, and that wliere there is no person in whom the fee can vwst, it.potentially exists in abeyance; as between the death of the incumbent and the next puesentation.

The parson having but a lifo estare in the glebe, unless it could so exist on his death, it must revert to the grantor.

Christian, in hzs notes on Blackstone, supposes the fee to be all the while in the lord of the manor.

This is by. no means the opinion of Blackstone, or of the still greater lawier, Cove; both of whom, if they are correctly understood, lay down the law to be, that the fee exists, between the death of the parson, and his succog-
sor, not in the lord, but in abeyance.

FEBRUARY TERM isis.
4. If the construction of the patent contended for in TIM. the inception of this argument is correct, 4here will he TOWN-OF no difficulty in fibding agraidee.'to uphold the fee, and PAWJ6.T make it subservient t.o the benevolent intentions of the T. crown. It would not be aviolent or unnaiural construc- n. .i.Auir tion to say that the town of Pawlet was granted to the &oTIrnnS. persons named on the grant, in fee, up.on condition that they should, in tic locatit.n of the t'wn, lay out and set apart i one share as a glebe for the church of E glad, Jkc." together wvith the other shares, for Bcnnin.g Wentworth, the first sf-led minister, and the school, according to te directiois indorsed.
Under such a construction, whkther the church were incorporated or not, they might reap the benefit of' toe use; .for as soon as tly become organized, and a clergyman settlel, they wotld be capable of receiviug the income of the land.
This constru.tion was adopted by te proprietors of the town. In locating the same they did survey a share and mark it off-as a glbe right. This appears friom the several acts of the state and in the argument of the counsel for the Plaintiff.
The preseutinhabitants of the toWn must all hold. their lands under the grant befp'e us, and not only so but from the origina lroprietors who so located and consecrated tho-giebe right which is now claimed by those persons.
By the laws, of England, and prohably of all cqlized countries,- the claimor or posssior of land is bound by the acts and confessions of thoso unde6 whomi he holds the claim or possession. By this rule then the.presefit inhabitants of Pawlet are hound by the act of lheir predecessors. That act was a complete recognition of the right of the church to the property ; an act which spuke louder than any language.
It may be said that the share was located by the proprietors of the town in their corporate capacity. If that was the case it is still the worse for them, because a corporation bever dies, and the location was.the act of the Plaintiff upon the record in this cause; and they are now

SUPREME COURT U. S.

claiming property which they once voluntarily adritte to belong to the church.
Again, it appears, that the Plaintiff in this cause is now enjoyingthe benefits of this construction in the shur given to a school and th, first minister settled in the town. Without t:i-4, or the third position taken in this argument, the town would have but slender prtences to the use of those two shares ; but it seems they claim those two lots by the same, or a more uncertain title, hold them by the same tenure, derive the right from the same source, and yet claim tho glebe also, and in order to sup. port that claiin are driv-n to the necessity of denying the legal and efficient prop.,rties of the instrument by which they, as well as the church claim.

B. This is a trust estate. The patentees named upon the gxant are the trustees for the use of the church whenever it should be organized in the town of Pawlet, so as to be enabled to receive the rents of the land.
'If a use can result from a grhnt by implication, it is
supposed this is a case of that kind.

In expectation that objections will be made to-such an interpretation of the casle those objections are endeavour'ed to be answered.

1. It may be said that the grant is silent as to any use or trust and therefore it is not to be implied.

The answer is, wherev6r from the nature or'the grant,
a trust estate can be implied, with propriety, where it is necessary to carry into effect the object of letters patent, the Court will adopt the implication.'

The Court are referred to .1 Bac. Jb. new ed. 89, Sand. on uses, 208, for the doctrine, of the iniplication of
useq.- In 12 .'lod. 162. Jones T. .foxlel., it is said that a use. may he declared without the word use. Any words that shew the meaning of the party are sufficient.

It has already been shewn that a church was in esse,.. when the grant was made and whether the church was

or was not incorporated, ca:un it be material; in either

case the title in the trustee would be valid. To this

point the Court are d.sired to lo ,kat i1Rep. 23, 21,and 2b, and Gilb. ws cases, 44f, where it will be found that

public institutions are capable of enjoying a trust, and it was decided that the pnor of the parish of Dale, al-

though not incorporated, were capable of a trust. With.

out adopting the principle thiat the church can lake an

equitable interest in these premises, there would in many

cases be an end to the workings of betievolence. Science

might often lose her patrons; the needy their bene-

factors, -and religion her warmest supporters.

Before wb part with this point we will once more look a the act of 1805, upon which the Plaintiff founds JA5 right to recover; and to its preamble, %h%ich de,-lares tile glebe lands in tile nature.of public reservations. If this nw.ans any thing, it uiust mean that the legal estate was reserved to the crown. As a proof that the legislature
so meant, observe tha followitg language, d,and assuch dc by thd revolution became vested in the sovereignty of lids "state." Now, sovereign as the state may be. she can
have no other or greater title than the crowr bf Great Britain had after the grant and before the revolution, and that right could be no more than a right reserved
for tire use of the church; heca .s'it never 'ought to be supposed that the crOwn made t"is -rant with no other
design than to reserve to its -ltw,hat it before had. If the king had an inclination to retain for his own use.a few shares -of the land, he might have done it dirertly ; in the same manner as the pine trees were reserved for his royal navy.

'Phis then is the rightof the stateof Vermont, on their

own construction, a r'ght to'do what, by the act of 1787, the 1gislature did, like honest men, and added security

to the already existing title of the churck.

If the right of the crown was of the nature described, and if the Court can suppose the 'land reserved to the
crown, and that the king codd be a trustei, they will then say that the state of Vermont could take no estate to the exclusion of the equitable right of the cesltai qui trist, but any forfeiture of the king or any act of his, could only prejudice his own rights, and not the rights of third inno-
cent parties. This doctrine will be found in I Blt.. Rep. 123,11urgesv. Wleat. Sand. on uses152-3, also252, 257.

If thbrefore the const'uction of thp legislature of Vei-
mont shotild be adopted, it would oily help the Plaintift to be defeated in this action; for it cannot be believed that the use as well as the legal estate could be reserved by the grant before the Court.

WLIBSTER, in ftply.

1. It is said to be the obvious intention ofthb grantor
to pass, by the grant, all the territory of Pawlet, with-
out any saving or reservation. But this i'asgainst the express words of the grant. The grant is made, " upon the conditiotis and reservations hereafter made;" nor is there any thing in the grant, to which the term - reservation" can be properly applied, except it be th public rights, as they are usually called, of which the nait appropriated for a.glebe, &c. is one.

The Defendants counsel further supposes, that at-
*though the territory was to be divided into sixty-eight equal parts, yet this was not to designate the propertini which each grantee was to receive; but that if any person, named in the grant, should not accept, or not
be capable df taking, or not happen to be. a person in,
esse, or in othee such case, then the whole tract would be to be divided among the residue. This is believed not to be a sound construction of the words of the grant.
Those words are, " do give and grant in equal shakres ,41unto our lovingsuhjects, &c. whoso names are entered ,"on this grant, to be divided amongst them into sixty" eight equal shiars, all that tract,'- &c. To what purpose was the tract to be divided into sixty-eight equal shares, if it were not to ascertain what portion 'each
grantee should have?

capacity in others to take, or dther such catise.

A great part of the states of New Hampshire and Vermont were granted by charters, issucd in tht. name of the crown, by the provincial governors of New Hampshire, which, charters were in all respects like this.
These charters or grtants have reccived a sttlcd construction, which has been followed by long usage, in both states. No case is known to have existed, in which any grantee has claimed a greater portion of the whole land, than his name bore to the nams on the
charter, including the public right; nor has any severance or partition been made, in any case, uptin any other ride or principle. To divide the land into sixtyeight equal parts, anti then adopt the plan of appropriat-
ing the whole t)a less number of owners, as, in the, example supposed by the Defendants counsel, to three, giving each twenty sixty-eighth parts, and two
thirds of one sixty-eighth part moro. would be to act without object or motive. Such therefore has never been supposed to have been the course contemplated in the grant. The .division or partition of lands holden tinder these charters has been, as is believed, in every instance,
by dividing the whole into as many parts, commonly called rights, as there were individuals named on the
charter, together with the public rights, anti allowing two parts to B. Wentworth. The shares allotted to tihe. public rights, are usitally dt-signated as the c6 school right."-' minister right." " society right," and 4 glebe right," respectively. These.hay never been claimed by the original proprietors. In New Hampshire (where the
Plaintiff's counsel is better acquainted with judicial proceedings ahdjudicial history than in Vermont) no legislative provision is recollected to have been made. The
first settled minist, r has usually posqessed the right designated for him. The town corporatiins, bodies totally distinct from the original prnpri,.tors, and owing their corporate existence, in all cases, to their charters,
or to acts of the legislature (for although this charter

undertakes to erect a.corporation, yet. in tact, no.
corporation ever existud, or was erected by Ihese grants)
have had the mangement and dispositia'n of the school right. The statutes of the state make it the duty of tho towns, in their corporate 'character, to wake proision for the support of free ichou1s, within the town, 9Alt under the manIgzment, -or t.e town a thority. Thesc school rig lts having been ofiginally intl.nded to aid in
the support of schools,.it has been holden, that, the law, throwing the duty of this support osn the town, hana given them the disp:sition of this fund for that.purposo. There bpiig no manner of privity between the town corporations end-the original grantees of the soil, the for-
mer can derive no title to these, school rights, but from the law ,of the state. That they have right to them js been settled by mapy de.cisions, followed by uniforni practice.

The grant to the society for propogating the gospet presented a different case. That was a corporation, then existing, and still r-xisting in England, capable by
its ch'rter, of -olding lands ; and dpubtless entitled, originally, to take the portion intended for it in this grant. Wflethr this society was not so far connected with the
national church and the realm of England, as that its ri. lts were. divested by tlhe revolution, has never been decided. Actions are pending, both in the Circuit and State Courts, n which this society is party, in relation to the's.. ands.

The glchp right has generolly, in point of fact, been
occupied M. disposed of by the town. No individu. al has been able to maintain a right to one of these lots,
or portitns,, upon his ecclesiastical character. It has been holden, on the contrary, that the grant, so far as it undertook to give one sixty-eighth part for a gleilbe, was void, for want of a grantee. Tho Plaintiff's cotinsel
have ben obligingly favored, by the prosent chiefjuwtice of New Hampshire, with notes of the case of .Iead -D.ARidier, in the Supreme Court of that state in i806 ; inwhic.h Curt the same judge then precided. To which case this Court is respectfully referred.

2. The Defendant contends that there was a church n CL&UM of England, as b) law established, capable of taing. &OTuERs. On this point, the Plaintiff's counsel will only remark,

1. That no grant to the church of Englapd, co tiwminw, coald'avail, even in England, to pasi the fee. Would su ch a grant entire to the see of Canterbury, or the diocese of London? The church of.England, in the aggregate, is not a curpo'ration, buL one of the estates o. the
realm.

2. But the grant is linited by the words of the charter iiself, to the churth of Englahid, as by law established, in th town of Pawlet. Just as the school right
is to be for the support of schools in that town, and the right, of the minister, first to be settled there. Itis
hai'dly neeo-ssary to draw into the argument even the. obvious intent of th6 grantor. The words themselves are. unequivocal: and dues nt the Defendant himself rest his- title 'upon his connexion with the Episcqpl.
society in Pawlet.?

As to the'laws ofVermont, before i805, they all show, that.the legisla'ture acted on the opinion, that it might dispose of these lands, as public property, in any way it thought proper. It wis a question of expediency and
propriety; 'and provision is made, in some of the laws, allowing-Epicop~l'.clergymen, already in possession, to Temain seven years.

SWith respect-to the opinion ascribed to a latejudgo 'ot this Court. it need only be re'arked, that if the cause. turned on the point supposed, (which does not appear at all from the record) it was but the opinion of an able judge; formed and pronounced instantly, in the course of a jury trial, without case reserved, or splemn argu-
menit; and it is no disrespect to say, possibly without a khowledgd of all circumstances,, or-a full view of all con-
sequences.

passed out or the king, and yet not vested a~iy Nvhiert, but remained in abeyance. But the text ofBlltckstone,
which lie cites, dovs not bear him out. *TiTe estate in abeyance, in tht. case put by Blarkstone, is a fee, remaining after a freehold has been granti d and vested. With respeet to the freehold of a gh'be, after the deali of the parson and before the namin., of a successor, both Fearne and Christian maiiiiain the contrary of Black-
stone's opinioi-but that is not. at all this case. To
meet this case, the Defendants most slvw, that if a grant be made tq a pc-rson not in esse, the land nevertheless passes out of the grantor, and remains in abeynwo unfil, in the course of events, some person arises into being, who answers the .descriltion in the grant.

4 . The observations already made are deemed a suffltient reply to the remarks of the .Defendants counsel
tinder this head.

5. It is not supposed possible to give in to the opinion, that this is a trust estate, granted to the individuals
named in the charter. The idea is wlolly novel. Not a syllable, in thie grant itself intimates- any such thing. All is the other way. How can it be imagined, that the int-ntion was to convey an estate in trust to a lIrgo
number of individuals; who were to be, at first, tenants in common-then, to divide and hold in severalty-and
whose estates. by law, would descend, in gavei.kind, to their heirs? Was B. 'Wentworth to be a trustee, whose
estate was severed by the charter itself? Was the corpo. ration in England to be one of thw trustees ? It is hardly necessary to add that the Court would not very willingly construe this grant so as to raise a-trust, which from the nature of the cAise never could be execited.

This, thln, is a case, in which th highest Courts of both stats -have concurred in giving to the grant in question a practicable and beneficial construction ; under which very -many estates, are holden, and the Court would not incline to disturb these titles, but for ir-
resistible reasons. It must b- remembered, thatthere are two hundred townships, granted by charters precisely. like this. In the Vhole, there are not probably more
than a dozen associations of Episcopalians. ' Iftho Court should decide, that the legislatures -may not dispose of

If this case is to be considered, not as a reservation, but a grant; and if this gr-int is not void. for want of a grantee ; then, it must, of necessity, receive this consttirtion ; i.e. that it was in fact ftgrant for the use pf such rainistry, br such religious purposes, as the tmov should choose, or the.state appoint ; at least, unless the
church of England should have been established by law. The general purpose was religious instruction. This duty the laws of the state throw on the towns, and it is a reas-inable construction which gives this fund, even
without any particular grant of the legislature, to the. towns, for that purpose. This coistruction will answer
the general-object of the grant. In no other way can any of its objects beanswered,, in one case out of fifty.
This puts it on the same ground as the grants fDr sclwols and for the use of the vdnistryj, (a common grant in the charters in the eastern part of New, Hampshire.) 'ho main purposes-f the.grants were education, and religious
instruction-and,in .the events which have happened,
the most safe; and only practicable, construction is to
give the funds intended for the promotion of these purposes, to those on whom the law imposes the obligation of making adequate provision for these objects. 1 eature to say such is the law of New Hampshire.

There is still another question, to which the Plaintiff's counsel wishes to draw the attention or the Court; and that is, has the Court jurisdiction of the cause? Is
this a case coming within that clause of the constitution which gives to this Court jurisdiction over - controver" sies between citizens of the same state, claiming lands "by grants of different stated?" It is submitted, with some confidence, that this is not such a case. These two grants are ndt to be considered as the acts of diffe-
ftnt states, in the sense of the constitution. At the time of the first grant,- both the present states of New Hampphire antd Vermont formed but one state.. They have become two) by subsequent sub-division. The first grant

it seems to the Plaifilif's counsel, tlat ii that case, the
'whole ground on which th jurisdiction of the Court
over this case rests, would have been removed.

It is easy to perceiive tme class'of cases, for which thi provision was made; for example, when disputes ;ibout boundaries between twb states arise. It is easy also to
imagine many bther cames, apparently within the letteri and yet not within the menbig. and so excluded by a just construction of the clause. These cases aris6 front the sub-divisioh of states. One mayinagibe, f r exam-lle, that in the state of Kentucky, ,jectments must be often tried, in which grants of Virginia bMfore the divi'sion, and grants of Kentucky sincei inight be respec-
tively relied on by the parties ; and yet it would hardly be contended that that circumstance should oust .tld
Courts of Kentucky of their jurisdiction, atid give the
cognizance of all such causes to the Courts of t:6 Un, ted States. It might be said, in such case, that Ad
-grants emanated from differt-nt st.t, s ; and, nomunally, they did so, Still 'they both' originated,, from a power having.undoubted authority to grant the territory. The 4 gr~t.grant was'not so much the act of a different state, as of the pai'elt of both states.. .Virginia, now, differs as
much from'*Virginia, before the severance, as Kentucky now differs from Virginia before the severance. Kentucky has the same power over her-territory'now, as
Virginia had, over the same territory fov'merly. She is therefore, as to this, to be cobsidered the same sovereign
power, in other'words the 8ame state. If integrity .f territory-or retention of jurisditidn dyer the whole of the same soil is necessary' to preserve the identity of pblitical power, thenVirginia herself is not what shmo'zstt
a grant -f hers before the severance, qnd a grant since., would be grants from different states.

The counsel for the Defendants in answer to the ob- PIAWLET jection made to the jurisdiction of tl Couat kill only V.
say, that this case is certainly within the. literal pr-oi- D. CLAIM sion of the c'mstitulion and it is presumed the Court %ill &o rmuns,

not search with solicitude to find a fdr-fetched tieaning in repugnance to the letteil so long ;,s it can protluce no other object than to send the parties to a trial in the
Courti of Vermont, where perhalis there is' not ajudge to be found but is interested for or against the Plaintifr, in this cause.

This is a case where the lands in dispute have been granted by difftirent states ; that is, by New Hampshire
and Vermont.

N-ow, although these states were all tnder onejui, diction, yet when the land was granted by the state of Vermont, they were two sovereign, indepen 'eut At..tts. and the same reason exists here, that ( an exist in any case of state controversy. for depriving the states reslpectively of the nower to determine the dispute.

It this cause is to be tried in Vermont, tit 1,..ges are to decide under the very strong iupressions of a It.gisla-
tive construction, uneqtivcally made, of the grant; and to give us what we claim as right, they must decide
against a positive statute of their legislatute. So far therefore is th s case from beinag taken from the letter of
the constitution, by any equitable. construction with a view to set up the spirit againstthe letter, thatit is within all the reasoning that governed the framers of the constitution, and most perfectly within the meaning of that clause; and one of the evils, which must have been
intended tohe guarded against, exists atfdL length, in
the present case.-

Why was the case of parties claiming land under ih grants of diffrent 'states made cognizable before the
United States? Courts ? undoubtedly because ilire this state of things exists it is reasonable to suppose tHrt the judges ofthe states respectively will feer'strong plepssessi-ns and are. therefore unfit to decide the -trill, in relation to the powers and rights of the conilieting states,

Itis tie same reason which induced the giving jurisdic tion ins,everal other cases, such as citiz'.ns or different stati'S ; and a state and citizens of another state. In these cases the state Courts may be deprived of their jurisdiction; and why-? Most indubitably because the the judges of the Coufts of. the United States have less interest, and fewer prejudices to overcome, and the parties will be more sure of an 'imliartial decision.

STORY, .edelivered the opinion of the "Court as follows ;

The first question pyesented in this case is, whether the Ciurt has jurisdiction. The Plaintiffs claim tinder a grant from the state ,f Vermont. and the Dv'lendants claim uider a grant froi' the state of New Hampshire, made at the time when the latter state comprehended the whole territory of the foimer state. "The constitution of the United States, among .'ther things,, extends the judicial power of the United States to controversies d"between citizens of the same state claiming lands tin,,der grants of different'states.." It is argued that the grant neuder which the Defeidants claim iq *notA grant of.a dliflerent state within the meaning of tle cnstitution, because Vermont, at the time of its emanation, was not a distinct government, bat was included in the sana soyereignty as New Hampshire.

But it seems to us that there is nothing in this objectioi. The constitution intendd to secure an impar.tial trib'nal for the decisitn of' causes arising from the grant-i of diff'rent states; and it supposed that d'state tribunal might not stand indifferent in. a controvprsy wflri the claims of 'its ovn scw ri-ign iwere in conflict with those of another soveri.n. It had no reference whatsoever to the antecedent situation of the territdry, whether included- in one sovereignty or another;' It simply regarded the fact whether graqts,arose under the f3ane or under different, states. NoW"'it is ver&' clear th although thl territory of Verinont was oncts a part of -New 'Haipshire, yet the state of Vermont, in its

FEBRUARY TERM iig.
sovereign capacity, is not, and never was the same as* T= the state of NewHampslire. The grant of the Plain. TOWZ OF tiffs emanated purely and exclusively from the sovt. PAWLE2. reignty of Vermont; that of the Dfendants purely and T. exclusively from the sovereignty of Nw Ha pshix,. DoCLUMm The sovereign power of New Hampshire remtins tla &OTIIES. same although it has lost a parr of its territw.; that-of Vermont never existed until its territory was separated from the jurisdiction of New Hampshire. The circumstance that a part of the territory or populaltin was once under a common sovereign no more makes the states the same, than the circumstance that a part of the membets df one corporation constitutes a cnmponnt part of another corporation, makes the corporation the same.. Nor cani it be affirmed, in any correct sense, that, the grants are of the same state ; for the grant of the Defendants could not have been made by the state of Vernont, since that state had not at that time any h-gal existenice; and the grant of the Plaintiffs could not have'been made by New Hampshire. since. at that. time, New Hampshire had no jurisdiction or sovereign existence by thi name of Vcimont. The case is, therefore, equally within time letter and spirit of the clause of"the constitution. It would, indeed, have been a sufficient answer to the objection, that the constitution and laws of the United Stat(-s, by the admission of Vermont into the union as a distinct government, had decided that it was a different state from that of New lamptfire.
The other question which has been argued is no without difficulty. It is cont,'nded by the Plaintiffs thalt the original grant, in the charter of Pawhlt, of "one ci share for a glebe for the church of England as by law s established," is either void for want of a grantee, or if it could take effect at all, it was as a public reservation, which, upon the revolution, devolved upon the state of Vermont.
.The material words of the royal charter of 1761 are, d5 do give and krant in equal shares unto our loving sub,6jects. &c. their heirs and assigns forever, whose names , are entered on this grant, to be divided- amongst them " into sixty-eight equal shares, all that tract or parcel 66 of landj, &c. antd that the same-be and hereby is incQr-

Thus
miking up, with the preceding sixty two shares, the whole number of sixty-eight shtlres stated in the char. ter.

Before we proceed to the principal points' in controversy, it will be proper to dispose.of those wlhichimore immediately respect the legnl construction of the language of the ciarler. And in out'judgm('nt, 3pon the true constiuction of .that instrument, nine of the grantees,- saving governor Wentworth, could legally take moie than one.single share, )r -a sixty-eighth part Of the to'vwnship. ''his constructIion is conf in'mable to iho

New Uampshire. It is not for this Coart up6n light grounds our ingeniotis and artificial reas,,ning to disturb a construlction which has obtained so ancient a banction, and-ML9 settled to many titles, even if it were at first somewhat doubtful. But it is not in itself doubtful ; for it is the only construction which will give foll effect to all the words of the charter. Upon any other,* the words.- in equal shares," and (i to be divided amongst
them in sixty.eight equal shaves," would be nugatory or senselesq. We aro further of opiiioti that the share

uge, or trust ,attaching tp the grant. It is nd where THFstated to lie a condition binding upon such pl-oprietors, TOWN Ok afthoagit other conditldns are expressly specified. Nor PAWLET is'it a trust or use growing out of the sixty-eighth part V. granted to tle respective proprietors, for it is cxelusiv'e D. CLAIM of these shares by the very terms of tie charter. The &oTnlRts. grant is in the same. claus4e with that to the society Fir the propagation of the gospel, and in the sime language, and oug!t, therefore, to receive the same construction, unless repugnant to the cinteXt, or nianit 'stly reilitiring a different one. It is very clear that the soriet tor die pr.pagation of the gospel take a l.gal, and not a merely equitable estat. , and there would be no repugnancy to.the context. in c.msidering the glebe, in whomsoever it may be held to vest, as a legal estate.
We are further of opinion that the .three shares in the bakhtei - . for a glebe." "-for the first settled ninster," and 6.f.ir school," are to be read in connexion, soas tii)rclode in each the words ,in the said town," i.e. of Pawlet; so that thlL whole clause is to he coilstrued, on e share for a glebe, &c. in the tqwl& of Pawtle, one share for the first settled minister in the town of Paiblet, and one share for a school in the town of Paw. lt.
We will now consider what'is the legal operation oP such a grant at the common law; and how -far it is affected by the laws of New Hampshire or, Vermont.
At common law the church of Englantd, in its aggregate description, is not deemed a corporation.

"bertates suas illcesas;" and lord Coke, in his commontary on the.text, obviously so understands it, 2 Inst. 2, 3. The argument, therefore, that supposes a dunation to ",the church of 'England," in its colictive capacity.
to be good, cannot be supported, for no such corporate body exists even in legal contemplation.

But it has been supposed that the "church of England of a "partiwcldar parish," must be a corporation for certain purposes. although incapable of asserting its rights and powers, except by its parson regularly inducted. And in this respect it might be likened to cer-
tain other aggregate corporations acknowledged in law, whose component members are civilly dead, and whose rights may be effe-tually vindicated through their esta. blislicd head, thotigh during a vacancy of the headship
they reimain inert; siich are the common law "corpdralions of abbot and convent, and prior and monkE of a
priory. Nor is this supposition without thn countenance
of authority.

The expression, parish church, has various significations. It is applied somnetimes to a select body of Christians forming a local spiritual association; and
sometimes to the building in which the public worship of the inhabitants of a parish is celebrated; but the true legal notion hi' a parochial cburch is a consecrated place, having attached f6 it the rights of burial and the ad. ministration of the sacraments.

This passage points clearly to the necessity of a spiritual corporation to uphold thb rectorial rights. We. shall presently see whether th,, parish church, afit r consecration, waq deemed in legal intcidnent s.,ch PI orporation. In his learned treatise on tenures, I ,rd chief baron Gilbert informs us that anciently, according to the superstition of thi age. abbots ,Pld prettdes 6were

Bit he says it is otherwise to a pet son claiming land in right of his church, for in cases of parochial churches,
gifts were not considered as inade to the parson, but to the church, quia ecclesiis paroeicalibusnonfit donatio personce, sed eeksice, secundurn perpendi poterit per modum dona-
tionis. Bracton, 286, b. 1 llceyes Hist. law, 369. And in another plae, Bracton, speaking of the modes of ac-
quiring property, declares that a donation may well be made to cathedrals, conventq, parish churches and religions personages, poterit etiam .donatiofieri in liberam elemnosynam, iicut eedesiis cathedfalibits, conventualibnbs, parochialibus, -vi-vis religiosis, &c. Bracton, 27, b. I 11ec-c Hist. law, 03.

The language of these passages would seem to consiier cathedral, conventual, and parochial churches as
corporations of themselves, capable of holding, lands. But upon an attentive examination it will be found to be io more than an abreviated designation of the nature, quality and tenure of different ecclesiastical inheritances,
and that *the real spiritual corporations, which are, t.ci.ly referred to, are the spiritual heads of the pai-ticular church, viz. the bishop, the abbot. and, as more impor.
tant to the present purpose, the parson, qui genit person-

Upon this ground it has been held in tho year books, I ItI. 1. 8., b, and has been cited as good law by Fitzherhert and Brook.,(Fitz: Feoftft. pl. 42.-Bro. Bstato pl. 49. S. C. Viner, ob. L. pl. 4 .) that if a grant be made to the church of such a place, it shall be a fee in the par-

THE But in asmuch asthere was not any church duifyconseTowN OF crated and established In Pawlet at the time of the charPAWLET tee, it becomes necessary further to enquire whether, at
V. common law, a grant so made, is wholly void for want D. CLARK of a corporation having a capacity to take.
&OTHERS.
In general no grant can take effect unless there be a sufficient grantee then in existence. This, in the case of corporations, seems pressed yet further; forif there bean aggregate corporation, having a head, as a mayor and commonalty, a grant or devise mado to the corporation during the vacancy of the headship is merely void ; although for some purposes, as for tife choice of a head, the-corporation is still considered as having a legal entity, 13 Ed. 4.'s.8i Ed. 4, 8, Bro.

Si.--t A'ldl Corp. 106, O7,-FPerk. § 33, 50. *Whcthier this doctrine has been applied ito parochial churches during an avoidance has not appeared'in.,any authorities that have fallen within our notice ; and perhaps can be satisfactorily settled only by a recurrence to analogous principles, which have bleen applied to the original endowmenuts of such churches.
We have already seen that no parish church, as such, could have a legal existence until consecration ; and c,,nsecraton was expressly inhibited unless upon a suitabl endowinent of land. '['he cannon law, following the civil law, required such endowment to be made or at least ascertained, before the building of the church waB begur. Gibs. 19.-1 Burn's Eces. law, 233. This endowm,,nt was in ancient times commonly made by an allotnoit',t"imaose and glebe, by the lcrd of the manor, who thereupon becam6 the,patron of the church. Other'.
persons also at the time. of consecration oftn contributed small portions of ground, which is the. reason, we ara told, why, in England, in many parishes, the glloe is not only distant from the manor, butlies in remote, divided, parcels, Ken. Par.Au: 222, 223, cited in I Biur's, Ecdes. lavy, 2,,. The manner of founding the chu'ch and making the allotment was for the bishop or his commissioner to, set up a cross and .set forth the ground whre the clorch was to be built, and-it then became the endowment of the church. Degge. p. 1, ch. 12, cited 1 Barn's, Fxedes. law. 233-

FEBRUARY TERM 185.
From this brief history of the foundation of parson- Tnages and churches, it is apparent that there could be no TowN or spiritual or other corporation capable of receiving live- P.AWLTnw ry of seizin of the endowment of the church. There ". could be no payron, for he could be indu ted into office D.cLn&K boly as a parson of an existing churc', and the endow- &oTnnns. nient must precede the establishment thereof. Nor is it even hinted that the h'ul was conveyed in trust, for at t is early period trusts were an unknown refinement. The land therefore must have passed out (ifthe donors, if at all, without a grantee, by way of public: appropriation or dedication to pious uses. In this respect it would form an exception to the generality of the rule, that to make a grant valid there must be a person in esse capa. ble of takin. it. And under such circumstances until a parson should be legally inducted to such new church, the fee of its hands would remain in abeyance, or be like the horeditasjacensof the Roman code in expectation of _.n heir. This would conform exactly to the ductrife of the civil law, which, as to .pious donations, Bracton has not scrupled to affirm to be the law of England.

a chappel had been built, to public and pious uses. atf. torin'e Gcneral v. Foley, 1 Dick..R?. 363. 'And in an intvrm ;liate period, !ord chiefiustice Dyer held that if the crown by a statute renounced an bstate, the title was gone from the crown, although not vested in any other person, but the fee remained in abeyahce.

(t is true that Weston, J. was, in tlhi same case, of a different opinion; but lord chief baron Comyns.has quoted Dyer's opinion without any mark of disapprobation. Comn. Dig. .Jbeyance,.A. 1.
PF6r the reasons then that have been stated, a dona-
tion by the crown fur the rse 'of a non-existing parish church, may well take eect by the common law as a dedication to pious uses, and the crown would thereupnm he deemed the patron of the future ben'.fice when brought into life. And after such a donation it would not be competent for the crown to resume, it at it, own will, or alien the property without the same consent which is necessary for the alienation of other chiurch property, viz: the cotisent of the ordinary, and parson, if tho church be full, or in a vacancy, of the ordinary alone.

And the same principies wouild govern the case berore the Coui'tif it were to be decided upon the mere footing of the common law. - Ifthe charter had been of a township in England. the grant of th, giheb. weuid havc taken effect as a dedication to the parochial church of England to he established therein.
Belore such church were duly erected and consecrated the fee or thegleb would remain in abeyance, or at least be beyond the pov.r of the arown to alien without the ordinary's consent. Upon the erection and consecration of such a church 3nM the regular ind .ction of a parson, such parson and his successors would. by opera. ion of law and without further act, have taken the inheritancejure ecclesie.

Let us now see how far these principles were applica. ble to New Hampshire, at the time ofissuing of the charter of Pawlet.
New Hampshire was originally erected into a royal

FEBRUARY TERTN i815,
province-in the 31st year of Charles 2d, and from thence Tux-; until the revutution, contiffued a royal province, under ToWN 01 the. immediate control and direction of the crown. By 1P'AYLET thefirst royal commission granted in Si, Charles2, among -. other things. judicial powers, in all actions, were grant- D. CLADx ed to tie provincial g vernor and council, ",so always &oTnuS. "that the forni of proceedings in such cases, and the ",judgment thereupon to bc given, be as consonant and 6,agreable to thelaws and statutes of this our realm of "Englana,. us the presejit state and condition of our sub:Cjects inhabiting within the limits aforesaid (i. e. of the
'province) and the circums'tances of the place will ad*'.mit." Independent, however, of such a provision, we take it to be a clear principle that the common law in force at the emigration of owir ancestors is deemed the birth -right of the colonies unless so fLr as it is inapplicable to their situation, or repugnant to their other rights -and privileges. .tlfortiori tlhe principle applies to a royal province.
By the same commissidn or charter the crown granted to the subjects of the province, ",that liberty of concscience shall be allowed to all Protestants,' and that " such especially as shall he conformable to the rites of 66 the church ofEbgland shall be particularly countenanc"ed and encouraged." By a subsequent commission of 15 Gee. 2, the governor of. tho province among other things, is-autlhwized "cto collate any person or persons "to any churches, chappels, orbther ecclesiastical bene"ices, within our said province., as often as any shall cc happen to-be void," and this authority was continued and cnfirmed in the same terms by royal commissions, ini Gee. 3, and 6 Gee. 3. By the provincial statute of 13 .Ann, ch. 43, the respective towns in the province were authorized to choose, settle and maintain their ministers, and to levy taxes for this purpose, so always tlfat no person who 'constantly and conscientiously attended public worship according to another persuasion slfould be excused from taxes. And the respective towns were further authorized to build and repair meeting houses, minnister's houses and school houses, and to provide and pay school-masters. This is the whole of the provincial and royal legislation upon the subject of religion.
In as much as liberty of conscience was allowed ani

HrE tlc church of England was Xi6t exclusiyely establisheds To WN oF the ecclesiastical rights to tithes, oblaions afid other dues rAWLET -had no legal. bxisten,'e in the province, Neither, upon
Iv. the establishment of churches, was a consecration by the D. CLARK bishop, or a presentation of a p',rson to the ordinary, in&OTHE S. dispensible ; for no bishopric existed within the pro-
vince.
But the coinmon law so far as it respected the erection of churches of ttie Episcopal periuasion of Englind, the right to present, or collate to such churches, and the corporate capacity of the parsons thereof to takt- in succession, seems to have been fully recognized and adopted. It was applicable to the situation of the province,' was avowed in the royal grants and commissions, and explicitly referred to iR the appropriation of glebes, in almost all the charters of townships in the province.' Arid itseems to -k also clear that it befonged ,to the crown exbtusively, at its own pleasure, to erect the church in each town that should be entitled to tske the glebe, and upod such erection to collate, through the governor, a parson to the benefice. The iespective towns in their corporate capacity had no control over the glebe ; but in as much as they were bound, by the provincial statute, to maintain public worship, and had therefore an interest t,) be eased of the public burthen, by analogy to the common law in relation to the personal property of the parish church, the glebe could not, before the erection of ,a church, be aliened by the crown without their consent i nor after the erection of a church and induction of a pars:1n, could the glebebe aliened without thejoint consent of the crown as patron, the parson as persona ecclesie, and the parishoneis of thc'church as having a temporal as well as spiritual interest, and thereby in effect representing ttic ordinary.
But a were voluntary society of'Episcopalians within a town, unauthorized by the crown, could no more entitle themselves, on account of their 'religious tenets, ''o the glebe, than any other societi" worshiping therein.
The chinicli entitled, must be a church recognized in law for this particular purpose. Whenever therefore, within the province, previous to the revolution, an Episcopal church wasduly erected bytho crown, in any town,

FEBUARY TERM 1Wi.
the parsons thereof regularly inducted had. a i'ght to the Tnn $leh.e in perpetual succession. Where no such church TOwN. OV was duly erected by the crown, the glebe remained as an 1,AWL.T hcereditasjans, and the state which succeeded tp the 1,. rights of the crown, might, with the assent of the. town, D. CL&1n alien or encuqiber it; orfmight erect an Epicopal &oTH~nchurch therein, and collate, either directly, or through the vote of the town,* indirectly, its parson, who would thereby become seized of the globejure ecdes-up-, and be a corporation capable of transmitting the inheritance.
Such in ourjudgmentaretherights and privileges of the Episcopal churches of New Hampshire, and the legal principles applicable Lb the glees reserved in the various to'wnships of that state previous to the revolution. And without an adoption of soiiie 6f the common law in tho manner which I have suggested, it seems very difficult to give full effect to the royal grants and commissions, or to uphold that ecclesiastical policy which the crown had a right to patronize And to which it so explicitly avowed its attachment.
It seems to~be tacitly, if not openly, conceded, that be: fore the revolution, no regular Episcopal chu'ch whs established in Pawlet. By the revolution the state' of Vermont succeeded to all the rights of the crown as to the unappropriated as well as appropriated glebes.
It now therefore becomes material to survey the statutes which the state of Vermont has, from time to time, passed on this subject.
By the statute of 26th otOctober, i787, the selectmen of the respective to%ns were authorized during the then septennnjr (which expired in 1792,) to take the care ,nd inspection of the glebes and to lease the sam for, and durihg the same term; andl further, to recover possession of the same, where they had been taken possession of by persons without title; but an exception is made in favor of ordairied Episcopal ministers, who during their .ministry within the same term, were allowed to take the profits of the glebes within tkeir respective towms.. Thi statute. of "SOth October, i791, 'granted to their respective towns the entire property of the glebes, therein situatq,for the sole use and support of rcligious4orship;and

SUPREME COURT U. S.

THE
TowN oF POWLET
T.
D. CLARK
&OTHERS.

authorized the selectmen of the towns to lease and re-
cover possession of such glebes. This act was velloaled by the statute of the 5th of November, 1779. But by the statute of the 5th of November, 1805, the glebes wiero again granted to tile respective townts, for 1lc lisC o'he schools of such towns; and pbwer'was g:vci to the selectmen to sue for possession of, and to jease the saime.

By the operation of these statutes, and esp,,ciall3 of that of 1794., which, so far as.it granted the.ghebes fo the towns, could not afterwards be repealed b3 tile legislature so as to divest the right of the towns under the grant, the towns became respectiyely entitled to all tile gilches situate therein which had not been prcvi,usly appropriated by th6 regular and legal erection of an Epis-
copal church within the particular town ; for in such case the towns would legally represent all the parties in
interest, viz. the state which might be deemed the patron, and the parish.

Without the authority of, the state, however, they could not apply the lands to other uses than public worship; and in this respect the statute of 1805, conferred a new right which the towns milt or might not exereise at their own pleasure.

Upon these principles the Plaintiffs are entitled to reoover, unless tle Defendants shew, not merely that be-
fore the year 1794, there was a society of Episcopalians in Pawlet, regularly established according to the rules of that sect, but that such society was erected by the
crown, or the state, as an Episcopal church (i. e. tile
church of England,) stablished in the towvn of Pawlet. For unless it have such a legal existence, its parson cannot be entitled to the glebe reserved in'the present charter.

The statement of facts is not, in this particular, very exact; but it may be inferred from it that the Episcopal society or church was not establishcd in Pawlet previous to tile year 1802. In what manner and by what
authority it was then established does not distinctly appear. As the title of the Plaintifts is however printafit. cie good, and the title of the Defendants is not shown to be sufficient, upon the principles which have been stated
the Plaintiffs would seem entitled tjudgment.

FEBRUARY TERM 180.

There is another viewof the subject which if any doubt Tm hung over that which has been already suggested would TrowN o decide the cause in favor of the Plaintifrs. And it is PAWrLUT entitled to the more weight becauseit seems in analagous V. cases to have received the approbation and sauctiin of D. clAzR the stte Courts of New Hampshire. In the various &OTI s. royal charters of townships in which shares have been reserved for public purposes (and they are numerous) ib has been held that the shares for telirst settled minister and for the benefit of a school, weie vested in the town in its corporate capacity ; in the lalter case as a fee simple absolute, in the former case as a base fee, determinable upon the settlement of the first minister by the
'town.

The foilndation of this construction is suplosed to be that the town is by law obliged to maintain public warship and piublic schools;, and that therefore the legal title ought to pass to the town, Which is considered as the real cestui que use. By analogy to this reasoning the share'for a glebe might be dleemed to be vested in the town for the use of an Episcopal church; and.then before any such church should be established, mid the use executed in its parson, by the joint assent (if the legislature and the town, the land might at any time be appro. priated to other purposes.

We do not profess to lay any particular stress on this
last consideration, because we am .ntirely satisfied to vest the' decision upon the principles whish have been before asserted.

On the whole, the opinion of the majority of the Court is, that upon the special statement of facts by the parties; judgment ought to pass for the Plaintiffs.

I6asog, . The difficulties in tWis case appear to mo to arise from refining too much upon the legal principles relative to ecclesiastical lroperty under the laws of
Englana.

I find no difficulty in getting a sufficient trustee to sustain the fee until the uses shall arise.

It is not material whether the corporation of Pawvlef

VOL. IX.

AS

SUPREME COURT U. S.
Tim consist of the, proprietors or inhabitants. The gratt ToWN OP certainly vests the legal interest in the proprietor ; and it PAIWV.LT is in nothing inconsistent with this idea to admit that
V. the corporate powers of the town of Pawlet are vested in D.CLARK the inhabitants. The proprietors may still well be held &OTHERS. trustees, but the application of the trust may b subject
to the will of the whole combined population..
'I therefore construe this grant thus, we vest in you so lnuch territory, by metes avid bounds, in trstito divide the same into sixty-eight shares ; to assign one share in fee to each of you, the grantees, two to the gotenori one to the church of England- as by law establisJed, &c. This certainly would be a suflicienf conveyance to support the fee for the purposes prescribed.
But the diffitulty arises on thte meaning of the words - chfirch of England as by law established." This was unquestionably meant to set apart a share of the land granted, for the use of that class of Christians known by the description of Episcopalian's. But was it competent for any man, or any number of men to enter upon this land,,without any legal de.ignation or organization identiffing them to come within the description of personsifor whose use this reservation was made? I tbink not.

Upon the hearing, the property was decreed to be restored to the claimants without payment of duties ; and this decree was afterwards affirmed in the Circuit Court. The cause has been brough't, by appeal, to this Court for a final decision.

We are all of opinion that the proprietary interest of tiue claiindntg is completely proved ; and therefore the decree of restoration must be affirmed,

With respect to the duties, we are all of opinion that the decree of the Courts below was erroneous. Where goods are, brought by superior force, or by inevitable nocessity, into the United States, they are not deemed to be so imported, in the sense of the law, as necessarily to attach the right to duties. If, however, such goods ai'o ffterwards sold or consumed in the country, or incorporated into the geperal mass of its property, they become retro-actively liable to the payment of duties. In the present case, if the goods had been specifically restored, and afterwards withdra;wn from the United States by the Claimants, they would have been'exempt from duties.

Manuel Pinto, a native of Buenos Ayres, being in xim

The ,, enem thit owner covenanted that the said vessel, being in all re-,"w mk6 spects sea-worthy, well manned, victualed, equipped, "'enem

dited for, the excess of the said freight over and above the sum of 7001. A delay of 10 running days over and above the time stipulaied is allowed the freighter, le paying for such demurrage at the rate of 101 los per day.
Under this contract a cargo, belonging in part to the freighter, in part to other inhabitants' of Buenos Ayres, and in part to British subjects, was taken on board the Nereide, and she sailed under convoy some time in November, 1813.
Ber license, or passport, dated the 16th of November, states- her' to mount 10 guns and to be monned by i6
mncII.
The letter of instructions from the owner to the master is dated on the 2-1-th of November, and contains this passage: cc Mr. Pinto is* to advance you what money you
requim-fo~slip's use at River Plate, and you will con-sider yourself as under his directions so far ais the i charter party requires."
On Vhe voyage, the Nereide was separated from hot' Ponvpy, and on the 19th of Decenibei, 1813, Ven in sight of Madeira, fell in with, and after an action of about fifteen minutes, vas captured by the Anerican privateer -The Governor Tompkins." She was brought into the port of New York, where vessel and cargo were libelled ; and the vessel and that part of the cargo which belonged to British subjects were condemned without a claim. That part of the cargo which belonged to Spaniards was claimed by Manuel'Pinto, partly for himself and partners) resfding in Bueios Ayres, and Tartly for the other owners residing in the same place. On the hearing, this part of the cargo was also condemned. An appeal was taken to the Circuit Court,where the sentence

It is true this vessel was armed, but Pinto had no agency in arming her. She was an armed vessel as
early at least as May, It8ii, before the War between the
United States and Great Britain. It is ti'ie site sailed with convoy, but this she was obliged by law to do. It
is true also 'that she resisted the capturing vessel; but neither Pinto, who was a passener on board, nor any other neutral passenger, gave any aid in the engagement,

The claim of Pinto, in behalf of himself, his father
and sister, who were jointly °interested with him in tho busimss which he carried on in his own name, was or three descriptions of goods.

:1st. Of goods of which they were the sole owners.

2d. Of goods of which they owned one undivided moxety, the other being owned by British merchants.

3d. Of goods in which they claimed an interest of one-fourth, the residue being British property.

As to this last claim he is charged with inalafides, lip-cause in his examination in preparatbri he stated without qualification that he*Wei the owner of one-fourth part of those goods, whereas in his claim and test affidavit le states the fact to be that lie had agr'eed with certain 1ritish merchants, that if they would give him I0per cent.
npon the sales, lie would select for them such goods as would sell, at Buenos Ayres, at an advance of 150 per cent. upon their cost and charges ; that lie selected these goods under that contract ; that his commissions would
have amounted to one-fourth of the original cost, and tP
that extent he believed himself interested therein:

There was no attempt to impose upon the C'ourt, he voluntarily explained the nature of his intcihst; if he was mistaken as to the legal effect or -such a contract,
.yet'-no improper motive can be attributed to him.

Neither Pinto, nor any person connected withl him,

the cabin during the whole e ngag.ment, and had no con-

cern whatever in th defence of the ship. It is true that

.be stats upon his examination in preparatori,o,i that he - belonged to the ship at the time of her capture, and had

" control of said ship and cargo." But his answers were

written by the commissioner, and le being a foreigner,

probably did not observe the force of the expression.

Tie nature of his control is explained by all the other

circumstances of the case to be a control within the limits of the charter party. It is'evident he could have

no lawful control over the management of the ship from

the time of her sailing from London until her arrival at

15uenos Ayres. The letter of instructions from the own-

er of the ship to the master, shows that the master was

under'he dirfction of Pinto so far only as the charter

party reqitiredl

It has been hdretofore said that Pinto bad acquired a hostile character arising from domicil. There is, however, no ground for such a pretence. It is trte that in the
chart-ir party he is said to be 4,of Buenos Ayres, but "now residtugiu the city of London ;" and in his examination in preparatorio,he states " that for seven years last cc past lie has lived and resided in England and Buenos
t .yres." But lie at the same time states thatilhe is a native of Buenos Ayres, that lie now lives there, and has
generally lived there for 55 years, and has been admitted a freeman under the new government of Buenos Ayres. Even if lie had acquir9d a domicil in England, which is not true, yet he had turned his back on that
country and was on his voyage home. 5"res. J.Tn. 787 Somerville v. Somerville. Pnto's test affidavit shows
particularly that his birth, residence, and cnnmorcial establishment had always been at Buenos Ayres, except during his occasional temporary absences in his commercial -pursuits. The test affidavit is always good evidence

FEBRUARY TERM 18111.

The Court is now for- the first time called upon to de- Trne

tide the question whether fieutral property forfeits its z,'Ettmun,

character of heutrality by being put on board an armed isE-iNETT,

ship of the enemy?

MSTEfl.

.Thre generairukl. is that.the property of a friend in a hostile vessel is not liable to condemnation.

There are but two excentinns to the neutral rilit to trade.

:I.He shall not carry contraband or war.

2. He-shall not violate a blockade.

If the sailing in an arned vessel of the enemy had been also an exceptioi, it would unquistionably have been noticed by some writer upon the l.w of nations. But no such exception is to be found in the books.

If such be the doctrine, w'hat degree of force will he sufficient to forfeit the neutral character of the goods ? If she carried a single musket, the principle must be the same as if she mounted fifty cannon. And sailing under convoy would be still more clearly within tha rule.

Vattel, b. s,c. 5, § 75, lays down the general principie thus: "-Since it is not thiplace where a thing is, "which determines the nature of that thing, but the "quality of the person to whom it belongs; things, be.: cc longing to neutral persons, which happen to be in ait " enemy's country. or the enemy's ships, are- to be disc"tinguished from those belonging to the enemy."

No hint is given that a distinctior isto be takeh be-
tween the armed and unarmed ships of the enemy. Agaiu in b. 3,c. 7,§ 116, lie says, ",the eff'cts of neutrals found "cin an enemny's ship, are to be restored to the owners, caca itbst whom there is no right of confiscation."

These are the only exceptions to the general' ule that the pro. perty of a friend must be'restored.

If this property is to be condemned, it must be on the ground of resistance;for it is understood that it has been decided by this Court that shipping neutral p.,operty on board an armed nteutral vessel even, will not subject it to condemnation. If'resistance be not the ground on which condemnation is claime, then in a case where no resistance is ma'ae, if neutral property be found on board an en6my's ship arm'cd merely for resisting thtv piratical boats of South Aincrica, it is liable io'condemnation.

But it will be said that the right to search isimpaired. MASTER.

The right of search is applicable only tu a neutral ship. Ifn case of a belligerent ship, the right of search is superseded by the right of capture.. The privateer had a
right to capture the Nereide, but, strictly speaking, had, no tight to search her. Pinto, by placing his goods on board a hostile ship, made them certainly liable to captufe, although not to condemnation. lie gave us the right of capture in lieu of the right of search.

The putting of neutral goods on board an armed vessel of the enemy, is analagous to the placing them in a fortified town. If they are placed there before investment they are not liable to condemnation, ifcapturcd'; but ifplaced there after investment they are liable.

But it will be contended that the fi'teenlh article of the treaty of 1795, between Spain and the United Sttcs, (Laws of the United States, vol. :!, p. 526.) hias altered the
rule of the law of nations on this subject, and that neutral Spanish goods found on board an enemy's ship are liable to condemnation as enemy's goods.

The words of the article are, "cAnd it is hereby stipu,,lated that free ships shall also give freedom to gouds ; " and that every thing shall be deemed free and exempt
which shall be. found on board the ships belonging to "the subjects of either of the contracting parties, al-
- though the whole lading, or any part thereof, should ",appertain to the enemies of either; contraband goods
" being always excepted."

.Itwill be contended, that if free ships make free goods, enemy's ships must make enemy's goods.

But we contend, that although by the treaty free ships make free goods, yet the rule of the law of nations still :remains in full force, that free goods found in an ene-
my's ship are also free, Nothing but an express stipu. lation in a treaty can deprive the Spanish subject of his rights under the law of nations. The treaty cqntains no such express stipulation. "The article stipulated does

not necessarily imply its converse. The two rules are not inconsistent with each other. The n eutral nation ia entitled to the benefit of both. Ward, 115.
It some of our treaties will be found express stipulations as to both points ; in others as to one of the points only; which fact shows that the two propositions are not considered as inseparable. ' The treaty of 1782, with Holland, adopts both rules-free ships are to make free goods, and hostile ships, hostile goods. So also does the convention of 1800 with France. P'ol. 6,appendix, p. 22.

As to the Spanish ordinance of Spain, cited in 2 zu. ni, 139,.which declares even the goods of Spanish sub-
jects to be good prize iff'ound on board an enemy's ship, it is a mere municipal regulation and docs not appear to have been adopted inpracti e against the citizens of the United States, even if it were in its terms applicablo
to them.

It is said that Spain would condemn our goods fountd
on hoard her enemy's ships, and therefore, upon the principle of reciprocity, we ought to condemn her goods found.on board the ships of our enemy. But the principle of reciprocity applies only 'to the case of salvage. It is not a rule of the law of nations as to prize of\var.

The proprietary interest of Pinto, his father and sis-
ler, and of the other inercliants of Buenos Ayres in whose behalf he has interposed a claim, cannot be disputed. Their national character is clearly made out. Th'e goods are not liihle to forfeiture, either on account of his residence in London, or the character of the ship, or the opposition which she made, or by the treaty of Spain; or the principle of reciprocity. They ought therefore to be restored; and without payment of the duties, inasmuch as it was not a voluntary importation.

that Pinto, had caused the ship to be armed, and had caused sundry British passengers to be taken on board, some of whom fought in tdin battfh. That lie had ac-

That Pinto must be considered as the owner of the vessel for the voyage, and as having a control overhP-

m regard to her resistance.

He admitted that neutrals have a right to carry on their accustomed trade in the usual manner; and to employ the mnerchant vessels of the enemy for that purpose; but not to arm a hostile vessel, nor to hire a hostile vessel already aimed.

He divided his argument into three points:

-T.. hat the property cannot be restored .without further proof, both on the subject of domicil and. on that of proprietary interest. And that, -under the circumstances of this case, Pinto is not entitled to time for further proof.

9. That by force of the treaty between Spain and the United States, taken in connexion with the existing law of Spain, the property is liable to condemnation.
S. That a neutral connot lawfully hire gn armed ves-
sel of our enemy, and in the course of that trade engage in battle with th- Uniter:States.

:. As to further proof respecting ixis doinicil.

In his examination ih preparatorohe states, that for the last seven years he resided in England and Buenos Ayres. This fact stood unexpla;ined upon the record for nearly a month. He then states in his test affidavit that he was then a-resident of Buenos Syres, where he had generally resided for 35 years; but says nothing In eqplanation of his former assertion, that he had resided the last seven years in England and Buenos Ayres. Why did he not state how long he had resided in each place? This leaves a doubt, which the Court would permit him to explain;if he stoud fair in Cour4 The charter party !lso states him fu.be then a resident in England.

Witl regard to the one-fourth which he claimed of

them as his own, 4nd afterwyards disclaimed them as British property.

Again his testimony is cqntradicted by Fitzey, his confidential clerk, who testifies that part or tme property claimed by pinto,,belonged to the government of Buenos

Pinto chartered the wjhole.ship. He permitted every thing to be put on hoard; the hostile.property as well as the neutral. He was to receive freight for the hostilo property, and a higher freight on account of the, armament. He knew that if this armament was employed to
protect the nrutral property it would protect the hostile also. lie impliedly undertook that the enemy's proper-

NEREXID,

nENl~ETT,

He says in his examination that he was interested in MASTER. the vessel and cargo and freight; and in a subsequent answer he states that he had the control of the ship ane cargo. It is clear therefore that he participated in the belligerent character, and is not entitled to further proof.

See 6 Rob. 460, the Atlantic.

2. As to theeffect of the Spanish treaty, in connexion with the existing law of Spain.

The trety says that cc free ships shall make free goods." This implies the converse proposition that hostile ships shall make hbstile goods.

This treaty followed the memorable discussion which took place between this government and Genet, in 1793. At that time w6 had a treaty with Prussia, f2 Vol.Laws
.S. 308, art. 2.) which contains the same stipulation that free ships shall make ffee.-oods; but is sirent as to
the converse proposition. The two treaties are to'be construed alike. Genet complained that we permitted the British t take Frendi goods out of our vessels. Mr. Jefferson was one 'of the negotiators of that treaty, and' it is clear that he understbod it .simplying that enemy
ships should make enemy goods. See his letters as secretary of state to Mr. Genet, of 24th Jul+, 1793, and to
Mr. Morris of the 16th of August,'i793. The adminis-
tration of our government constituted, at that time, per-
haps as wise acabinetas ever existed. This t6caty was their act. The .proper construction mist be that the eonverse rule is implied. Ward, 1" -05.

But when the treaty is taken in connexion" with the existing law of Spain at the time of making the treaty, there can be no doubt. By that law enemy ships make enemy goods. 2. .Azuni 139. The lMr. Debron there mentioned was a Spaniard. There were two ordinances onein 1701, the other in :ZI8. They are referred to in
2. Yalin, 252. b. S. tit. 9. art. 7. As to these ordinances, it is-singular that they do not say that the goods of a friend In an enemy'sship shall be liable to confiscation;
but that the goods of a Spanish subject in an eremy's ship

SUPREME COURT V. S.
Tmm shall he so liable. This however implies the other propo. sznzDEE, siti6n ; for if the goods of their own subjects were so liaBENNET,ble, the goods of a friend would, a fortiori, be liable.
MASTEN.
It is said that these ordinances have not been enforced against im. But we are not bound to show thatfact. It is sufficient for us that the law exists.
Reciprocity is the permanent basis of the law of nations.
3. If a neutral hire an armed vessel of our ebemyp and with armed force resist our belligerent rights, he forfeits his neutrAl character.
A neutral may pursue his accustomed trade 'inhid usual manner ; but the law of nations allows nothing further.
It has been said that the only test of neutrality is impartiality to the belligerents. This is true only in a national point of view. But when individuals are concern'd,.a very different test applies. (See the case of the Tulip.) A neutral cannot justify furnishing one belligcrent with transports, by furnishing them to the otker also. ('ee Vattel, b. S. eh. 7. § 109. l10, where will be tund the whole doctrine of the law of nations on this
subject.)
The general rule is that nothing qhall be done by a neutral to invigorate the belligerent.
A right of peacefuf commerce is not a right to set forth a warlike expedition. On that principle a govern. ment might be neutral and all. its subjects, belligerent. The words'of the elementary writers are to be constru.ed according to.the subject upon which they treat. They all speak of a peaceable merchant vessel, not an armed vessel.
Neutrals, says sir W. Scott, may trade in the samne mnannr as before the -war,provided they take no direct part in the contest. It is not necessary to show that the party actually put a match to the guns. This vessel was forced intar action by Pinto ; at all events sh6

was brought into action by means of Pinto. He had a Tam

direct part in the contest.

NERI.3DE,

3Lr"ixETT,

The authority cited from Bynkershoek, is in our fa- NXAST'R. Tvor, if we interpret the words according to the subject

matter. He says a neutral may let as well as hire a vessel, but it must be a lawful letting and hiring. He

did not mean to say that a neutral rhay carry on a peace-

ful trade in a hostile manner. In the next sentence he

says you may employ the vessel and the labor of the bel-

ligerent.

it is clear that he means an unarmned vessel.

What are the rights of the belligerent in regard to the neutral

lie may searchthe vessel, the cargo and the papers.
We have reason to complain'of a neutral who puts a cargo like tlis (a great part being belligerent) on board
a belligerent armed vessel, whereby our right of search. is eluded,. without a battle. A icutral may, indeed, if he can, elude the riglt of search by superior sailing, but ie cannot lawfully prevent it by force.

In the case cited from S Rob. 906, there is not evidence that the vessel was-armed. If the fact had been so it
would undoubtedly -havebeen mentioned by th6 reporter, or the judge; Their silence shows that it was not armed.

The slightest recourse to belligerent force in support'

of neutral rights is fatal. A neutral vessel may armi but she cannot resist belligerent rights. A neutral must not directly nor indirecty contribute to the force of aii enemy. In I Rob.287, the .Maria,it is decided that resistance of the convoy ship is the resistance of the whole on-

voy; and that the resistance of the ship affects the cargo.

In the case of the ELtsebe, 5 Rob. 171, (Dig. Ed.) one of the

questions was whether the cargoes, belonging to subjects of the Hans Tounts, laden on board SwCdish vessels, and

gailing under Swedish convoy, were liable to condemnation ? the-convoying ships having resisted search by the Britiqh fleet. It was contended on their behalf that they were not involved in the penalties of Swedish resistance,

which was an act of the Swedish government, and didJ not bind the subjects of other powers,; that the propritors of these cargoes were not privy to this fact ; and that the masters of the vessels were not the agents of the cargoes, so as to bind them. Sir William Scott, after stating that there was in the'charter party an express stipulation that the, ship should sail with convoy, sa.,ys, " But I will take the case on the supposition that there " was no such engagement. The master associates him" self with a convoy, the instructions 'of which ho must
,, be supposed to know ; he 1us the goods underwlawfid "cprotection, and it must be presumed that this is 1ione i with due aixthority from the owners, and for their bei nefit. It is not the case of an unforeseen emergency

On the contrary it is a matter done antecedentlj " to the voyage, and must therefore be presumed to be - done on communication with the owners and with their 9c consent; 'and the effect of this presumption is such ,, that it cannot be permitted to be averred against ; in ", as much as all the bvidence must come from the 6ug. sc pected parties theinselves, without affhrding a possi,, bility of meeting it, however prepaied. Tie Court " has, therefore, thought it not unreasonable to apply "cthe strict principle of law. in'a case not entitled to any ,, favor) and holds, as it does in blockade cases of that " description, that the master must be taken 'to bb the " authorized agent df the cargo, that he has acted under ",powers from his employer, and that if lie has exceeded cc his authority, it'is barratryi for which he is personal.

The same principle was afterwards advanced by the Danish governmefit in relation to American ships sailing under British convoy, and acquiesced in by the American government. See the letter from our minister', Mr. Irtin, to the secretary of state of 23d June, 181t. and the letter front the Swedish minister, Rosenci-ntz. to Mr. Irvin, of the 28th of June, I81.

A neutral cannot employ the force of his own govem. ment, nor tht of another -neutral, much less that of a belligerent, to protect himseltf froim search. If yon cannot make use of the convoy, you cannot take the g$ins of that c5 nvoy and protect yourself. It is'not the modification of the. force, bit the force itielf that is unlawful. If a neutral, insured assuch, range himself under convoy, the policy is vacated.
This case is not like that of neutral goods ]ut into a fortifie(ttown before investment: it is more like that of goads placed there after ,investment. They were put on boird with a full knowledge that the vessel would h(- 11L,vested, (if a land term may be, permitted in speaking of a naval transaction) that is, that she would be liable to search.

ty to give ti.e stipulation its full extent hnd scopb.

This principle was first attempted to be established by Holland immediately after tie treaty of Munster. They sought to establish by treaty tharthe flag'should coiimunicate its character to the cargo. This was the
original form of the proposition, It necessarily involyel the principle that hostile ships should make h~stilo
gooils. How preposterous would it be to sqiy that neutr~l ships should make neutral goods, but enemy's ships should not Make enemy's goods.

It is the universal understanding among nations t hat the two propositions are mutually connected, and .tho one implies the other. It might have been necessary in the outset to express both, but wien. the principld wag generally understood, that necessity ceased. The Unit. ted States had no interest in extending' the iange of the principle; and in all hep treaties,.except tbose ivith Spain and Pi-ussia, she has stipulated for both parts of the rule. There is no reason, either in the commercial br belligerent policy. 6f the United States, which should induce her to stop short with the proposition, tha.t free ships'should make free goods, and not go on to adopt the converse.
Spain had no motive to adopt the principle with the limitation under consideration. In her treaties with, Frane,"Holland and England, she adopts the principle in its whole extent. She took. it.'with lite 'qualifictition' that neutrals should not put their goods on.board a belligerent vessel. In her treaty with England she ozpresses only the converse, viz: that "enemy ships'sliall make enemy goods. '

It has bben said that she limited the principle by ac-
ceding to the armed neutrality; but that was a more ephemeral act, and its validity depended upon an event Whici never happened-the accession of England.

procity. In the oroinance of 17,02 it appears to be her wni favorite principle that cenwrny ships shaUl make CnernyxNuB.nn, goods." In the ordinance of 1718 the same principle is BENN.r, adopted and ordered to be carried into execution. These MASTE. ordinances were re-enacted in 1739, 1756, 1779, 1794 and 1796. The treaty now under consideration vas wedged -inbetween two of these ordinances; those of 179t and 1796. Is it possible that Spain, the, declared enemy of neutral rights, meant to Tpcognize a principle like this, which had never before been taken under the protection of any nation? Are, wve to suppose that Spain, ly this treaty, meant to abandon her own local law? Spain has had this principle in abhorrence. By her ordnance of 1718 she says that if any part of the cargo is hostile it shall communicate its character to tha ship and all the residue of the cargo. This princilflo cannot be undrstood but iji the manner for which we contend.
By the law of Spain, therefore, this property would be liable to condemnation.
By the rule of reciprocity it ought to be condemned here.
But it is objected that the Spanish law has never been enforced against us. It is sufficient for us to show that it exists. In the absence of'contrary proof the presumption is that it has been executed.
It is -said also that the rule of reciprocity applies only to the case of "e-capture and salvage. But sir W. Scott, in the Santa Cru, (4 Rob. 53, hin. Ed.) says that " this principle of reciprocity is by no ueans peco" liar to cases of re-capture: it ib found also to operate "in other cases of inaritinie law: at the breaking out" of a war it is the constant practice of this country to "condemn property seized before the wiar, if the enemy "condemns, and to restore if the enemy restores. It is " a principle sanctioned by the great foundation of the d la: of England, magna chartaitself; which prescribes "cthat at the commencement of a war the enemy's mer,chants shall b6 kept and treated as.our own merchants ",are treated in their country."

SUPREN1E COURT U. S.

answer was received from. France when we complained of the Berlin and Milan decrees. The British orders in council also iwere founded upon the same prinelio. Great Britain attempted'to justify them by the assertion that we acquiesced in the Berlin and Milan decrees. The assertion was not true; but it shows tbat Great Britain acknowledged the rule of reciprocity as a rule of the law of pations.
3. As to the armament and resistance.
The undisputed facts are that Pinto hired the whole vessel, and took in goods on freight for his own benefit. That the vessel was armed, sailed,, resisted, and was captfired.
It i'cohtended that lie could lawfully do all this. If lie could, lie was a "cchartered libertine." Cart a lieutral surround himself ,,with all the pomp and circumstance of war ?" The idea of our opponents exhihits a dis.ordiarertm-an incongruous .mixture of disrordant attributes; a centaur-like figure-half man, half ship; a phantastic form, bearin*g in one hand the spear of Achilles. in the otlier the olive branch of Minerva; the frown of defiance on her brow, and the smile of conciliation on her lip, entwining the olive branch of pcace around the thunderbolt of Jupiter, and hurling it, thus disguised, indiscriminately at friends and foes.
From the authorities cited qn the other side, an inference is attempted to -be drawn that a neutral may lawfully employ an armed merchant vessel of the enemy to transport his goods. But none of those autlorlties speak of an armed vesssl. Such a vessel unquestionably has power, to mAke captures. If she has a commission, the captures are for her own benefit; if she has no commission, she captures for the crown. Her prizes aro droits of admiralty. It is truo that if she sails without a pass, or some document to show her natioial chractdr, she would be considered as a pirate; but this vessel had a British pass. If all neutrqls may

lawfully hire-such vessels, the ocean may be covered Tr

with them, and they might more effectually aid the ene- -naRlnDE,

BENNETT,

Bynkershoe, says the neutral must do nothing to the prejudice of the belligerent. It is incumbent, therefore,

upon Pinto to show that he did us no prejudice by char-

tering such an armed vessel. We say he thereby in-

fringed our right of search. It is said that the right or

search is a right to search the ship only. But why search the ship? To see what sort of a cargo she has.

The cargo, therefore, must be searched as well as the

ship. A neutral cannot carry contraband goods, nor

violate blockade, nor carry his own property if it be the

produce of his estate in the enemy's country. To pre-

vent this the belligerent has a right to stop and sefrch

his cargo. In this case it is the hostile character of the

vessel which constitutes the offence, in as much as it pl~e-

vented our right of seach.

In the case of the B!sebe the cargo was forfeited by sailing under convoy which resisted' search. Pinto fall3 by the fate of war. He identified himself with a kostile, armament; lie knew the necessary consequence of his act; he knew it would be the duty of the ship to resist; and that resistance would be made if there should be any chance of escape thereby. He must be either at peace or war. Ho cannot claim the advantages of both conditions at the same time.

E ETT, in reply,

After removing the oltjections which had been raised as to the British domicil of Pinto, and as to some variations between his testimony in preparatorioand his test affidavit, &c. ohs'rved,

As to the treaty with Spain, that the maxim cfree ships shall make frce goodsp? does not imply the converse, that hostile ships shall make hostile goods, There
is certainly no necessary connexion between Ithe two maxims, nor have they ever-been supposed to be necessarily counectedL The one is the claim of a neutral, the other of a belligerent. What is the rule of justice?
That free ships should make free- goods, and that frec

SUPREME COURT U. S.
THE goods, in belligerent ships, should be free also. WhenEn.REzn, ever the two maxims have been connected in a treaty, BENNBaTT, it has been where one of the maxims was important to 31ASTER. one of the parties as a neutral nation, and the other to
- the other party as a belligerent nation.
In the treaty of the armed neutrality in i780, the interest of the Dutch was to have the benefit of both maxims, The Dutch idea however was discarded by the
northern confederacy, and the two maxims completely separated.. The empress of Russia in her manifesto of the 26th .of February, 1780, declaring the principles which she intended to follow, states this principle in the fOlowing words, c(That the effects belonging to the ,subjects of the said warring powers shall be free in "all neutral vessels, except contraband merchandize." But she says nothing respecting neutrai goods found on board belligerent vessels. It cannot be supposed that she meant to surrender her neutral rights by more implication. The principle is expressed in nearly the same words in the treaty of armed neutrality of 1780 ; nothing is there said respecting neutral goods in belligerent vessels. The king of Prussia, however, in his answer to. the Russian manifesto, explicitly claims the freedom of neutral goods on board belligerent shipsp as wvell as of belliger.nt goods on board' of neutral ships. These facts show that in the general understanding of all Europe, the two maxims were entirely distinct and independent. See also ,fartens's Law of.J'Pationf, transLWted byl Cabbct, 318. The United States did not exist as a nation until after the two maxims wero thus completely separated.
Only three of the treaties by the Unite4 States have been produced on the other sode. There are in fact eight in which the principle' is mentioned. I The treaty with France of the 6th of February, 1778, iol. I V. 398, which. expressly adopts both maxims; the United States having in that instance yielded to the belligerentclain of France. 2. The treaiy with Holland of the 8th of Octoberj 1782, vol. 1, p. a56. 3. The treaty with Sweden of 4d April, 1783; evol2., p. 256o adopts only the maxim that free ships shall make free goods. 4. The treaty with Prussiaof 1785, vol. 2, P. 320, which adopts the principle free ships, &c. only. S. The treaty

FEBRUART TERII I85.

with Morocco, 1787, .o2L, p. 869, which stipulates that THE free ships shall -makefree goods, and that neutral goods z1,E DE, on board of belligerent vessels shall also be free. This RENnLTf, latter stipulation was necessary, in zs much as the Bar- MASTER. bary powers pay little respect in practice to the law of
nations. 6. The treaty of 1795, with the Dey of Algiers, -vol.2, p. 500, which adopts the maxim,free ships, free goods. 7. The treaty with Spain of :.795, voL 2, p.
526, adopts the same maxim. 8. The treaty with Tripoli, of 1796, -vol. 4., p. -1, adopts the same maxim and
further stipulates that neutral goods shall be free in belligerent vessels. It was not necessary that such a stipulation should be inserted in the treaty with Spain, because Spain knew the law of nations nd professed to respect it.

If there be no doubt, then, as to the construction to be given by the Spanish treaty, there is no necessity to dismiss the ordinance which is supposed to be connected with it. The principle which they call the rule of re-
ciprocity ought more properly to be called the rule of retaliation.

But there is no such ordinance of Spain as is pretended. The ordinance applies only to Spanish goods found on board t~ie vessels of the enemy, and was a more temporary provision to continue only during the war. It appears by the extract from D'idbreu, found in 2 jzuni, 1.89, that the liability of the goods of neutrals
found on board the vessels of the enemy depended bpon
treatizs and not upon that ordinance.

The rule of retaliation is not a rule of the law of na-

tions. The violation of the law of nations by one na-

tion does not make it lawful for the offended nation to

violate the law in the same way. It is true that states

may resort to retaliation as a means of coercing justice

from the other party. But this is always done as an act

of state, and not as the mere result of a judicial execu-

fiqn of the law of nations. It is the effect of policy, not

of law. Such were the measures adopted by the orders

in council of Great Britain, and the offensive decrees of

France, and of other nations under the control of France.

which have been mentioned on the other side. The go-

latio, of its rights and it chooses its own means. But the tribunals of justice must decide according. to law.
- rthe cases alluded to by sir W. Scott in the Santa Cniz, are cases in whiclv the government cotld lawfully exercise its discrelion in receding from its acknowledged rights. Thus in the case of property seized at the breaking otrt of a war, the government would have an unquestioned righit to condemn or to release it. It was not the rgkt to condemn which depended upon,the rule of recipr'oity, but the. inexpediency. It was nora question of law, but of policy.

As to the armament, and the resistance.

It is difficult to say in what fact the opposite party
coisider the criminality to exist. Is it that Pinto took unarmed passen.ers on board? This waslawful. Was it the taking on board enemy goods ? This was innocent.
Was it in chartering an armed vessel ? There is no rule of the law of nations against it. Was it in arming the vessel ? The fact is not proved. Was it in joining in
e combat? It is fully proved that lie tookno part in the contest.

But it is said that chartering the vessel makes him owner forthe voya.e. This is not the rule in a Court of
4dmiralty. Even if an enemy charter a neutral vessel lie is not owner for the voyage. The vessel is always restored. Bynkershoek says it is not unlawful for a neutral to hirc a vessel from the enemy, for commercial purposes. But it said that he means an unarmed ves. sel. There is nothing to support that idea. rhe natural presumption is that an enemy's ship would be armed.

It'is said also that a neutral may deposit his goods in an armed belligerent vessel under a bill of lading, but
n1'under a charter-party. That is, that several neutral
merchants may severally occupy the whole ship, but that one cannot. A.distinction founded upon no differenre of principle cannot alter the cse. flow does lie
call the belligerent faculiesof theship into action, more in one case than in the other? Does the nentral add to her belligertnt faculty, by lading her deeply-vad giving her a destination from which she dare not depart in quest
of her enemy ?

This is not a commmssioned vessel. That case Mniglt TflD be different. The Eperier -was a comissioned vessel, NELEDE, and it is said was coming from Bermuda with bullion ENNETT for the British troops in Canada; otherwise probably a MASTEn. claim for the bullion would have been interposed. In the'case of the British packets captured during the present war, was the property of the neutral passengers confiscated ?,These vessels were armed and commissioned. But.there is no distinction taken in the books between commissioned and uncommissioned vessels, except that the latter cannot make captures, under the penalty of being treated as pirates. 2 .q-uni, 233.
If the doctrine he true in regard to an armed vessel, it must be equally true with regard to convoy; yet they do not pretend that this vessel is liable to condemnation because she sailed with convoy. The law of England is now that no vessel shall sail without convoy. Such a doctritio would go to .prevent neutral property from being laden on board an English merchantman. Did England suppose, when she was passing.the law requiring all vessels to sail with convoy, that she was cutting herself off from all neutral freight?
When writers on the law of nations speak of a belligerent vessel, what do they mean ? They -speak of it as of a wolf which you can only hold by the ears-Lumm aurirus tenere. They mean a vessel carrying on uwar. But-can a vessel carry on war without arms ? What degree of armament is sufficient to make it unlawful for a neutral to employ her ? One musket, or two, or twenty ?
The Con olato del M3are, was written long before the knowledge of fire arms, and does not speak of the distinction between armed and unarmed. In all the battles in which England has been engaged, and in all her commercial transactions, has such a case iiaver occurred before? If it has, why are the books silent upon the sub; ject. Why has not a single writer in the worhl mentioned thedifference between neutral goods found in an afmed and in an unarmed vessel of the enemy? See 2 Azui d, 191, 195,196, 197, and the authorities there cited.
The owner of the ship was an enemy.. He had a perfect right to arm and defend his ship. The master, for

SUPREME COURT U. S:
THE this purpose was his exclusive agent. His act in do. WEREIDE9. fending the ship cannot be attributed to the innocent BExEwTT, owrer of the cargo, wAho also had a perfect right to put MASTER. his goods on board Sich a ship; and who did not interfere
in the combat. But it is said that a neutral has only a right to carry on his accustomed trade in his accustomed manner. Where is it said that it must be carried on in his accustomed-manner ? There is no authority for such a restriction, nor any principle to justify it.
But this trade from London to luenos Ayres was al. ways carried on in British ships, and often if not generally armed. This was a voyage carried on in the accustpmed way.
It is said also that by. putting these neutrA goods 'on b.'rd an armed vessel our right of search, as a belligerent nation, was impaired.
Buthow is the right of search applicable to this case? This is a secondary right, auxiliary to the belligerent right of capturing the enemy's goods on board a neutral vessel. Itis applicable only to a vessel bearing a neutral Bag. The belligerent has a right to know whether the cargo be really neutral, and for that purpose must examine it atgea. But ifthe vessel bears the flagofan premy, there is no necessity to search the nature of the cargo at sea. You have tie right to capture at once, and bring her in, when the cargo may be examined ; the neutral must make out his claim, and is never entitled to damages for the delay or the detention. . Why does neutral resistance of search forfeit the car. go as well as the vessel, although the owner of the cargo had no concern in the vessel nor in the resistance? it is because the act of resistaice was wholly unlawful'; and the owner of the cargo can recover damages, from the owner of the vessel or the master. But here the resistance was lawful; Pinto could never recover damagef against the master for defending his ship.

:. Thatthe Claimant, Manuel Pinto, has neither made mAST-Un. sufficient proof-of his neutral character nor of his property in the goods he claims.

2. That by the treaty between Spain and the United States the. property of a Spnish subject in an enemy's vessel is prize of war.

3. That on the principles of reciprocity this property should be condemned.

&. That the conduct of Manuel Pinto and of the vessel has impressed a hostile character on his property and on that of other Spaniards laden on board oftheNcreide.

1. Manuel Pinto is admitted to be a native of Buenos Ayres, and to carry on trade at that place in con nexion With his father and sister, who are his partners, and who
also reside at Buenos Ayres ; but it is contended that he has acquired a domicil in England, and with that dopficil the English commercial character.

Is the bvidence in any degree doubtful on this point ? Baltaza Ximenes, Antonio Lynch, and FelLx Lynch, tiree Spaniards; returning- with Pinto in the Nereide, all depose that Buenos Ayres.is the place of his nativity and of his permanent residence, and that he carries on trade at that place.

In his test affidavit Manuel Pinto swears in the most explicit terms to the fact that Buenos Ayres is, and always has been the place of his permanent residence; that'he carries on business there on account of himself,
his father, and sister, and that he has been absent for emporary purposes only. His voyage to London, where he arrived in June, i8i3, was for the purpose of purchasing a cargo for his trade at Buenos Ayres, and of establishing connexiovis in London for the purposes of
his future trade at Buenos Ayres.

This Vlain and direct testimony is opposedp

3ErNNETT, In his answer to the first interrogatory he says that MIST L. he wag born at Buenos Ayres, that for seven Yeirs last
past, he has lived and resided in England and Buenos

Ayres, that he now lives at Buenos Ayres, that he has generally lived there for thirty-five ycal s last past, and has been admitted a freeman of the new government.

Whatever facility may be given to the acquisition of a,
commercil domicil, it has never heretofore been contended that a merchant having a fixed residence, and
carrying on business at the place of his birth, acquires a foreign commercial character by occasional visits to a fbreign country. Had the introduction of the words "se-
ven years last past" even not been fully accounted for by
reference to the interrogatory, those words could not have implied such a residence as would give a domicil. But they arefully accounted for.

In his answer to the 12th interrogatory he repeats that he is a Spanish American; now lives and cari'ies on trade at Buenos Ayres, and has generally resided
there.

2. The second piece of testimony relied on by the,
counsel for the captors is the charter party. That instrument states Manuel Pinto to be of Buenos Ayres now residing in London.

The charter party does not state him to have been for-
merly of Buenos Ayres, but to be, at its date, of Buenos Ayres. Nothing can be 'more obvious thin that the expression, now residinginLondon, could be intended to convey no other idea than that he was then porsonally
in London.-

As little importance is attaqhed to the covenant to receive the return cargo'at the wharf in London. The performance of this duty by the consignee of the cargo as the ageilt of Pinto, would be, a complete execution
of it.

Thi question respecting ownership of the goods is ASsTER.

not so perfectly clear.

-

Tie evidence of actual ownership, so far as the claim asserts property existing, at the time, in himself and partners, is involved in no uncertainty. The te~t affidavit annexed to the claim is full, explicit, and direct. It goes as faf as a test affidavit can go in establishing the right which the claim asserts. All the documentary
evidence, relating to this subject, corroborates this affi-
davit. The charter party shows an expectation that, of
a freight of 700L the goods of Mr. Pinto would pay400L The very circumstance that he chartered the whole vc§sel furnishes-strong inducement to the opinion that a great part of her cargo would be his own.

The witnesses examined in preparatorzo,so far as they know any thing on the subject, all depose to his interest.
V liam Puzey was clerk to Pinto, and he deposes to the interest of his employer, on the knowledge acquired in making out invoices and other papers belonging to the cargo. His belief too is, in some degree, founded on the clharacter of Pinto in London, where lie was spo-
ken of as a man of great respectability and property and from the anxiety he discovered for the safety of the property after the Nereide was separated from her convoy.

The bills of lading for that part of the cargo which is claimed by Pinto, are filled up, many of them with his
name, some to order, and the marginal letters in the manifest would also denote the property to be his. Where
he claims a part of a parcel of goods the invoice is sometimes to order, and the marginal letters would indicate the goods to be the'property of Pinto and some other person.

Tlhis testimony proves, very satisfactorily, the inteir-
est ofPintos house in the propetty he claims. There is lo counter testimony in the cause, except the belief expressed by Mr. Puzey, that for a part of the goods Pinto was agent for the government of Buenos Ayres. This

SUPREME COURT U. S.
THn belief of Mr. Puzey is supposed to derive much Ayeight EI.9IDE, from his character as the clerk of Mr. Pinto. The imBERNETT, portance of that circumstance, however, is much dimin-
MASTER. ished by the fact that he had seen Pinto only a week before the sailing of the Nereide, and that hedoes not declare his belief to be f6unded on any papers he had copied or seen; or on any communication made to him by,his employer. The.e are other and obvious grounds for his suspicion. A part of the cargo consisted of arms and military accoutrements ; and it was not very surprising that Puzey should conjecture that they were
purchased for a government about to sustain itself by the sword. But this suspicion is opposed by considerations of decisive influence, which have been stitqd at the bar. The defiand for these articles in Buenos Ayres by the government would furnish sufficient motiveor to a merchant for making them a part of his.cargo. In a considerable part of this,warlike apparatus, British subjects were jointly concerned. It is extretreely improbable, that, if acting fo his government, lie -would hive. associated its interests with those of British merchants. NTor can a motive be assigned for claiming those goods for himself instead of claiming them for his governmelnt. They would hiot by such claim become his if restorel. He would still remain' accountable to his governmentp and the truth would lhavQ protected the property a vffectually as a falshood, should it remain undetected. By
~laimin.q these goods for himself, instead of his govern-
ment, he would commit a peijury from which he could derive no possible advantage, and which would expose to imminent hazard, not only those goods lut his whole interest in the cargo. The Court; therefore, mustconsider this belief of Mr.Puzey as a suspicion,'which a full knowledge of the facts ought entirely to dissipate. If there was nothing in the cattse but this suspicion, or this belief of Mr.Puzey,' the court would not attach any inportance to it. But Mr. Pinto himself .has, in his examination in preparatorio,been at least indiscreet in asserting claims notto be sustained ; and in terms which
do not exhibit the real fact in its true shape. In his answer to the 12th interrogatory he says "And thia " deponent also has one-fourth interest as owiler of

He had agreed with certain persons in England to select for them a parcel of goods for the market of Buenos Ayres, of which he was to be the consignee, and which he would sell on a commission'of 10 per cent. on the amount of sales at-Buenos Ayres. These goods were selected, purchased, and .consigned to Manuel Pinto. The hills of lading were in lIis possession, and he considered his interest under this contract as equal to one-f6urth of the value of the goods, "wherefore," he

It is impossible to justify this representation of the fact. The reasoning might convince the witness, but the language he used was undoubtedly calculated to mis-
lead the Court, and to extricate property to which the
captors were clearly entitled, 'although the witness :aight think otherwise. Such misrepresentations must be frowned on in a prize Court, -and must involve a
CIaim, otherwise unexceptionable, in doubt aid danger. A witness ought never to swear to inferences without stating the train of reasining by 'which his mind has
been conducted to them. Prize Courts are necessarily watchful over subjects of this kind, and demand the utmost-fairness in the conduct of Claimants. Yet prize Courts must distingnish between misrepresentations
which maybe ascribed to error of judgment, and which Are, as soon as possible, corrected by the party who has made them, and wilful falsehoods Which are detected by the t03timony of others, or confessed by the party when detection becomes inevitable. - In the first mase there
may be cause for a critical and perhaps suspicious ex.. amination of the claim and of the testimony by %01-hit is supported; but it would be hitrsh indeed to condemn neutral property, in a case in which it was clearly proved to be neutral, for one false step, in some degree equivo-
cal in its character, whica was so soon corrected by the party making.it. ,

The case of Mr. Paul's printing press is still less du-

bious in its appe rance. It would require a very criti.

cat iniestigation of the evidence to decide whe!hler this press is stated in his answer lo the 12th interro tAey to be his property or not. Four presses are said ;n tiat answer to belong to him ; but he also says in his an-
swer to another intelTogatory; perhaps the 26th, that Mr. Paul had one printing press on board. Whlther
there were five presses in the cargo, or only ibur, has
not been decided, .because the declaration made in his examination in prepizratoriothat one of .the presses be. longed to Mr. Paul proves unequivocally that the ms-
take, if he made one, was not fraudulent.

That he should state as his, the propierty %wiichbeionged to a house in Buenos Ayres, whose members all resided at the same.place, and of which he was the acting and managing partner, was a circumstance which could not appear important to himself, and which was of no importance in the cause. These trivial and accidental inaccuracies are corrected in his claim and in his test affidavit. The Court does not think them of sufficient importance to work a confiscation of goods, of the
real neutrality of which no serious doubt is entertained.

2. Does the treaty between Spain and the United
States subject the goods of either party, being neutral, to condemnation as enemy property, if found by-the other in the vessel of an enemy? That treaty stipulates that neutral bottoms shall make neutral goods, but contains no stipulation that enemy bottoms shall communicate the hostile character to the cargo. It is contended by the captots that the two principles are so completely identified that the stipulation of, the one necessarily in.
cludes the other.

Let this proposition be examined.

The rule tfat the goous of an enemy found in the ves. sel of a friend are prize of war) and that the .go'ds of a friend found in-the vessel of an enemy are to be restoredy is believed to be a part of the original law of nations, as generally, perhaps universally, acknowledged. Certainly 't has been fully and unequivocally reeoiniz-d by the United States. This rule is fdunded on the sim-
plo and intelligible principle fhat war gives a full right to capture the goods of an enemy, but gives no rig ht to

FEBRUARY TERDI ii,
capture the goods of a friend. In the practical applica- Tim tion of thts principle, so as to form the rule, the proposi- nLnDE, tions that the neutral flag constitutes no protection to BENNETT, enemy property, and that the belligerent flag communi- 3LASTEn. cates nb hostile character to neutral property, are necessarily admitted. The character of the property, taken distinctly and separately from all other. cunsiderations. depends in no degree upon the character of the vehicle in which it is found.
Many nations have believed it to be their interest tq vary this simple and natural principle of public law. They have changed it by convention between themselves as far as they have believed it to be for their advantage to change it. But unless there be something in the nature qf the rule which renders its parts unsusceptible of division, nations must be capable of dividing it by express compact, and if they stipulate either that the neutral flag shall cover enemy goods., or that the enemy flag shall infect friendly goods, there woudd, in reason, seem to be no necessity for implying a distinct stiphlation not expressed by the parties.. Troaties are formed upon deliberate reflection. Diplomatic men read the public treaties made by other nations and cannot be supposed either to omit or insert an article, common in public treaties, without being aware of the effect of such omission or insertion. · Neither the one nor the other is to be ascribed to inattention. And if an omitted article be not necessarily implied'in one which is inserted, the subject to which that article would apply remains under the ancient rule. That the stipulation of imnmu. nity to enemy goods in the bottoms of one of the parties being neutral does not imply a surrender of the goods of that party being neutral, if found in the vessel or an enemy, is .the proposition of the counsel for the Claimant, and he powerfully sustains that proposition by arguments arising from the nature of the two stipula-tions. The agreement that neutral bottoms shall make neutral goods is, lie very justly remarks, a concession made by the belligerent to the neutraH. It enlarges the sphere of neutral commerce, and gives to the neutral flag a capacity not given toit by the law of nations.
The stipulation-which subjects neutral property, found in the bottom of an enemy, to condemnation aq prize of

war, is a concession made by the neutral to thie bellige, rent. It i:arrows the sphere of neutral commerce, and
tak,.s from the neutral a privilege he possessed under th law of nations. The one may be, and, often is, exchang d for the other. But it niay be the interest and
the will of both parties to stipulate the one without the other; and if it be their interest, or their will,' what
shall prevent its accomplishment? A neutral may give some other compensation for the privilege of transporting enemy goods in safety, or both parties may find an
interest in stipulating for this privilege, and neither may be di!posed to make to, or require from,, the othr the surrender of any right as its consideiation. What shall restrain independent nations from making such a compact? And how is their intention to be communicated to each other or to the world so properly as by the compiact itself?

If reason can furnish no evidence of the indissoltibility of the two maxims, the supporters of that proposition
will tc;rtainly derive no aid from the history of their progress from the first attempts at their introduction to the present monient.

For a considerable lengt-h of time they were the companions of each other-.-not as one maxim consisting of a single indivisible principle, but as two. stipulations, the one; in the view of the parties, forming a natural and 9livious consideration for the other. The celebrated
compact termed the. armed neutrality, attempted to effect- by force a great revolution in the law of nations. The attempt failed,- but it made a deep and lasting impression on public sentiment. The character of this effort has been accurately stateWd by the counsel for the
Claimants. Its object was to enlarge, and not in any thing to diminish the rights of neutrals. Theogreat powers, parties to this agreement, contended for the principle, tiat free ships should m:ke free goods; but not for the converse maxim ; so far were they from supposing
the one to follow as a corollary from the other, that the
contrary opinion was openly -and distinctly avowed. The king of Prussii declared his expectation that in future neutral bottoms would protect the goods of nit enemy, and that neutral goods would be safe in an ene-
my bottom. There is no reason to believe that this opi

FEBRUARY TERI I8SM.

&ionwasnot common to those powers who acceded to 1*w

the principles of the armed neutrality.

N-PIDZ,

BY4NNTLT
From that epoch.to the present, in the various trea- BtAsTER. ties. which have been formed, some contain no article on the subject and consequently leave the ancient rule
in full force. Some stipulate that the character of the cargo shall depend upon the flag, some that the neutral .fagshall protect the goods of an enemy, some that the goods of a neutral in the vessel of a friend shall be
prize of war, and some that thd goods-of an enemy in a neutral bottom shall be safe, and that friendly goods In the bottom of an enemy shall agho be safe.

This review which was taken with minute accuracy
at the bar, certainly demonstrates.that in public opinion no two principles are more distinct and independent of each other than the two which have been contended to be inseparable.

Do the United States understand tl.is subject ditrerently from other nations ? It is certainly not from our treaties that this opiion can be sustained. The United
States have in some-treaties stipulated for both principles, in some for one of Ithem only, in some that neutral
bottoms shall make neutral goods and that friendly goods
shall be safe in the hottom of an enemy.. It is therefore
clearly understood in the United States, so far as an opinion can be formed on thir treaties, that the one principle is totally independent oftic other. They have stipulated expressly for their separation, and they have sometimes stipulated for the one without the other.

But in a correspondencebetween the secretary ofstate or the United States and the minister of the French republic in 1793, Prussia is enumerated among those na-
tions with whom the United States had made a treaty adopting the entire principle that the character of the cargo should be determined by the character of the flag.

Not being in possession of this correspondence the Court is*unable to examine the construction it has re-
ceived; It has not deferred this opinion on that account. because the point in controversy at that time was te obligation imposed on the United States to protect belli

SUPREME OU:RT U. S.
THE. gerent property in their vepsels, not ditc liability of their W36hknin, property to capture if found in the vessel of a bellige-

incidentally the treaty with Prussia which contalns tte principlo that free. bottoms )i&:."e free goods, it should have escaped his recollection that it did not contain the converse of the maxim. On the talents and virtues which adorned the cabinet 'of that day, on the patient fortitude with which it resisted the intenperate violince with Nhich it was assailed, on the firmness with which it maintained those principles which its sonso, of duty prescribed; on the wisdom of the ruls it ftdopted, no panegyric has been pronounced at the bar in which the best judgment of this Court does not concur. But this respectful deffcrence may well comport with the opinion, that an argument incidentally brought forward hy way of illustration, is not such full authority as a decision directly on the point might have been.
3. the third point made by the captors is, that what. ever construction might b6 put on orr treaty with Spain, considered as an independant measure, the ordinances of that government wpuld subject American property, under similar circumstances, to confiscation, and therefore the property, claimed by Spanish subjects in this case, ought to. be condemed as prize of war.
The ordinances themselves have not been produced, nor has the Court received such information respecting them as would enable it to decide certainly either on their permanent existence, or on their application to the United Stateg. But be this as it may, the Court is decidedly of opinion that reciproc;atiag to the subjects of a nation, or retaliating on them, its ,njust proceedings tok'ards our citizens, is a political not a legal measure. It is for the consideration of the government not of its Courts. The degree and the kind of retaliation de. pend entirely on considerations foreign to this tribunal. It may be the policy of the nation to avenge its wrongs in a manner having no affinity to the injuey sustained, ,irit may be its policy to recede front its full rights and not to avenge them at all. It is not for its Courts to interfere with the proceedings of the nation and to thwart its views. It is not for us to depart froin the boaten trac-

FEBRUARY TEI 18i6.
prescribed for us, and to tread the devious and iotricate THE path of politics. Even in the case of salvage, a case pe- NERLD*. culiarl within the discretion of Courts, because no fixed n. 'r, rule. is prescribed by the law of nations, congress has not MASTEIU. left it to this department to say whether the rule of foreign nations shall be applied to therm, but has by law applied that rule. if it be the will of thegovernment to apply to Spain any rule respecting captures which Spain is supposed to apply to us, the go'ernment will manifest that will by passing an act for the purpose. Till such an, act be passed, the Court is bound by the law of nations which is a part of the law of the land.
Thus far the opinion of the Court has been formed without much difficulty. Although the principles, Is. sorted by the.counsel, have been sustained on both sides with great strength of argument, they have been found on examination to be simple and clear in themselves. Stripped. of the ihmposing garb in which they have been presented to the Court, they hate no intrinsic intricacy which should perplex the understanding.
The remaining point is of adifferentcharacter. Belligere.nt rights and neutral privileges are set in array against each other. Their respective pretensions, if not actually intermixed, come into close contact, and thio line of partition is not so distinctiy marked as to be, clearly discernible. It is impossible to declare in favor of either, witbout hearing, from the other, objections which it is difficult to answer and arguments, %hiich it ir not easy to refute. The Court has given to this subject a patient investigation, and has endeavored to avail itself of all the aid which has been furnished by the bar. The result, if not completely satisfactory even to ourselves, is one from which it is helieved we should not depart were further time allowed for deliberation.
4. Has the conduct ot Manuel Pinto and of the lNereide been such as to impress the hostile character on that part of the cargo which was in fact neutral i

and made resistence. IHow claim?

do these facts affect tho

Had the vessel been armed by Pinto, that fact would certainly have constituted an important feature in the
case. But the Court can perceive no reason for believing she was armed by l'im. He chartered, it is true
the whole vessel, and that he might as rightfully do as contract for her partially ; but there is no reason to believe that he was instrumental in arming her. The owner stipulates that the Nereide " well manned, victus, ailed, equipped, pro'ided and furnished with all things 66 needful for such a vessel," shall be ready to taje on board a cargo to be provided for her. The Nereido,
then, was to be put, by the owner, in the condition in which she was to sail. In equipping her, whether with or without arms, Mr. Pinto was not concerned. It appears to have been entirely and exclusively the act of
the belligerent owner.

Whetherthe resistance, which was actually made$ is in any degree imputable to Mr. Pinto, is a question of still more importance.

It has been argued that lie had the whole ship, and that, therefore, the resistance was his resistance.

The whole evidence upon this point is to 'e found in the charter party, in the letter of instructions to the
master, and in the answer of -Pinto tor one of the iter'. rogatories in priparatoiio.

The charter party evinces throughout that the ship remained under the entire direction of the owner, and
that Pifito in no degree partio'pated in the command of her. The owner appoints the master and stinulates for
every act to be performed by the ship, froni the date of the charter party to the termination of the voyaqe. In
no one re.pect, except in lading the vessel, was Pinto to
have any direction of her.

The lQtter of instructions to the master contahms full directions i-or the regelation of his conduct, without any other reference to 'Mr. Pinto than has been already
stated. That reference shows a positive limitation of

*his power by the terms of the charter party. Conse- Tm qiiently he had no share in the government of the ship. NEREWE,
BENN'ETT,
But Pinto says in his answer to the 6th interrogatory .NUSTER. that lie had control of the said ship and cargo."

Nothing can be more obvious than that Pinto could understand himself as saying no more than that he had the control of the ship and cargo so far as resperted her lading. A part of the cargo did not belong to him, and was not consigned to him. His control over the ship began and ePidtd with putting the cargo on board. He does not appear ever to have exercised any authority in
the management, of the ship. So far from exercising any during the batth-, lie went into the cabin where he remained till the conflmct was over. It is, then, m.ast ap. parent that when Pinto said he had the control of the ship and cargo, lie us..d those terms in a limited sense. He us-d them in refer,-nce to the power of lading her, given him by the. charter party.

If, in this, the Court be correct, this cause is to be govwned hy the principles which would apply to it had the Nereide been a general ship.

The next point to be considered ist.he right of a neutral to place his goods on board an armed belligerent
merchantman.

That a neutral may lawfull put his goods on board a belligerent ship for conveyance (;n the ocean, is universally recognized as the original rule of the law of na-
tions. It is, as has already been stated, founded on 'le
plain and simple principle ihat the property %fa friend remains his property wherevcr it m .y Le found. cSSince it is not," says Vattel, 6.the plaue where a thing is which determines the natere of that thing, but the character of
the Perion to whom it belonis, things bel:mwging to neu-
tral persons which happen to be in an enem) s country o- on board an enemy's ships, are to be distinguished ?f'om those wh:ch hel-ng to the enemy."

Bynkershoek lays down the same principles in terms

equally explicit; and in terms entitled to the more con-

sideration, heause he enters into the enquiry whether a

VOL.lX,

BENrNETT, MASTER.

knowledge of the hostile character of the vessel can ef% feet the owner of the goods.
The same principle is laid down by other writers on the same subject, and is believed to be contradicted by none. It is true there were some old ordinances of France declaring that a hostile vessel or cargo should expose both to condemnation. But these ordinances have never constituted a rule of public law.

It is deemed ot much importance that the rule is uni-
versally laid down in terms which comprehend an
armed 'as well as an unarmed vessel; and that armed vessels have never been excepted from it. Bynkershoeka
in discussing a question suggesting an exception, with his mind directed to hostilities, does not hint that this privilege is confined to unarmed merchantmen.

In point of fact, it is belibved that a belligerent merchant vessel rarely sails unarmed, so that this oxcep-
tion from the rule would be greater than the rulo itself,
At all events, the number of those who are armed and who sail under convoy, is too great not to have attraq-,
ed the attention of writers on public law; and this exception to their broad general rule, if it existed, would
certainly be found in some of their works. It would be strange if a rule laid down, with a view to war, in such broad terms as to have univers*al application, should be so construed as to exclude from its operation almost every case for which it purports to provide, and yet thit not a dictum should be found in the books pointing to such construction.

The antiquity of the rule is certainly not unworthy of
consideration. It is to be traced back to the time when almost every merchantman was in a condition for selfdefence, and the implements of war were so light and so cheap that scarcely any would sail without them.

A belligerent has a perfect right to arm in his own defence; and a neutral has a perfect right to. transport
his goods in a belligerent vessel. These rights do not interfere with each other. The neutral has no control over the belligerent right to arm-ought he to be ac-
countable for the exercise of it

FEBRUARY TERM 1815.
By placing neutral property in a belligerent ship, THE ,that property, according to the positive rules of law, .nz RLE, does not cease to be neutral. Why should it be changed nN Tv.T, by the exercise of a belligerent right, universally ac- mAsTER. knowledged and in common use when the rule was laid dqwn, and over which the neutral had no,control?
The belligerent answeis, that by arming his rights are impaired. By placing his goods under the guns (f an enemy, the neutral has taken part with the enemy and assumed the hostile character.
Previous to that examination which the Court has been able to make of the reasoning by which this proposition is sustained, one remark will be made which applies to a great part of it. The argument which, taken in its fair sense, would prove that it is unlawful to deposit goods for transportation in the vessel of an enemy generally, however imposing its form, must be unsound, because it is in contradiction to acknowledged law.
It is said that by depositing goods on board an armed belligerent tile right of search may be impaired, perhlaps defeated.
What is this right of search? Is it a substantive and independent right wantonly, and in the pride of power, to vex and harrass neutral commerce, because there is a capacity to do so ? or to indulge the idle and mischievous curiosity of looking into neutral trade? or the assumption of a right to control it? If it be such a substamtive and independent right, it would be better that cargoes should be inspected in port before the sailing of the vessel, or that belligerent licenses should be procured. But this is not its character.
Belligerents have a full and perfect right to capture enemy goods and articles going to their enemy which are contraband of war. To the exercise of that right tme right of search is essential. It is a mean justified by the end. It has been truely denominated a right growing out of, and ancillary to the greater right of capture. Where this greater right may be legally ex.

SUPRME COURT U. G.
THE ercised withbut search, the right of search can nevoi 2q.REIDFE, arise or come into question. ISEWNEVTT,
MASTER. But it is siid that the exercise of this right may be prevented by the inability of the party claiming it to capture the belligerent carrier of neutral property.
And what injury results from this circumstance ? If the property be neutral, what mischief is done by its cs. caping a search. In so doing there is no sin even as against the. belligerent, if it can be effected by lawful means. The neutral cannot justify the use of force or fraud, but if by means, lawful in themselves, he canes. cape this vexatious procedure; he may certainly emplovr them.
To the argument that by placing his goods in the vessel of an armed enem ', he connects himself with that enemy and assumes the hostile character; it is answer, ed that no such connexion exists.
The object of the neutral is the transportation of his goods. HIs connexion with the vessel wbich transports them is the sime, whether that vessel be armed or unarmed. "nbe act of arming is not his-it is the act of a party who bas a right so to do. He meddles not with the armamenit noir with the war. Whether his goods were on bard or not, the vessel would be armed and would sail. His goods do not contribute to the arma. merit further than the freight lie pays, and freight lie would pay were the vessel unarmed.
It is difficult to peri'cive in this argument any thing which does not also apply to an unarmed vessel, In both instances it is the right and the duty of the carrier to.avoid capture and to prevent a search. There is no, difference except in the degree of capacity to carry this duty into effect. The argument would operate against the rule which permits the neutral merchant to employ a bellige''rent vesssel without imparting to hls goods the belligerent character.
The argument respecting resistance stands on the same ground with that which respects arming. Both are lawful. Neither of them is chargeable to the goods

BENNLTap

MASTER.

It is remarkable that no express authority on either side of this question car be found in the books. A few scanty materials, made up of inferences from cases dependibg on other principles, have been gleaned from the books and, employed by both parties. They arc cer-teinly not decisive for or against either.

The celebrated case of the Swedish convoy has been pressed into the service. But that case decided no more than this, that a neutral may arm, but cannot by force
resist a search. Tihe reasoning of the judge on that 'ccasion would seem to indicate that the resistance con-
demned the cargo, .because it was unlawful. It has been'inferred on the one side that the goods would be infected by the resistance of the ship, and on the other that a resistance which is lawful, and is not produced by the goods, will not change their character.

The case of the Catharine Elizabeth approaches more
nearly to that of the Nereide, because in that case as in
this there were neutral goods and a belligerent vessel. It was certainly a case, not of resistance, but of an at-
tempt by a part of the crew to seize the capturing v~ssel. Between such an attempt and an attempt to take the same vessel previous to capture, there does not seem to be a-total -dissimilitude. But it is the reasoning of the judge and not his decision, of which the Claimants
would avail themselves. He distinguishes between the effect which the employment of rorce by a bellige-
rent owner or by a neutral owner would have on netutral goods. The first is lawful, the last unlawful. The
belligerent owner violates no duty. He is held by force and may escape if he can. From the marginal note it appears that the reporter understood this case to decide in principle that resistance by a belligerent vessel would not confiscate the cargo. It is only in a case without
express authority-that suchinaterials can be relied on.

If the neutral cikaracter of the goods is forfeited by the resistance of the belligerent vessel, why is not the neutral character of the passengers forfeited by the same

THE cause ? The master ant crew are prisoners of -war, -fEflptinF, why are not those passengers. who diI not engage in the BENNETT, conflict also prisoners ? That they are not would seem MAsTER.. tO the Court to afford a strong argument in favor bf the
goods. The law would operate in the same manner on both.
It cannot scape observation, that in argument the neutral freighter has been continually represented as arming th6 Nereide and impelling her'to hostility. He is represented as drawing forth and guiding her warlike energies, The Court does not so understand the case. The Nereide was armed, governed, and conducted by belligerents. With her force, or her conduct the neutral 6hippers had no Concern. They deposited their goods on board the vessel, and stipulated for their direct trans portation"to Buenos Ayres. It is true that on her passage she had a rikht to defend herself, did defend herself, and might have captured an assailing'vessel; but to
search for the enemy would have been a violation of the charter party and of her duty.
With a pncil dipped in the most vivid colours, and guided by the hand of a master, a splendid portrait has been drawn exhibiting this vessel and her freighter as forming a single figure, composed of the, most, discordant materials, of peace and war. So exquisite was the skill of the artist, so dazzling the. garb in which the fig re was presented, that it required the exercise of that cold investigating faculty which ought always to belong to those who sit on this bench, to discover its only imperfection : its want of resemblance.
The Nereide has not that centaur-like appearance which has been ascribed to her. She does not rove over the ocean hurling the thunders of war while sheltered by the olive branch of peace. She is not composed in part of the neutral character of Mr. Pinto, and in part of the hostile character of her owner. She is an open and declared belligerent; claiming all the rights, and subject to all the dangers of the belligerent character. She conveys neutral property which does not engage in her warlike equipments, or in any employment she may make of them ; which is put on board solely for the purpose of transportation, and which encounters the hazard in-

In this it is the opinion of the majority of the Court there is nothing unlawful. *Thecharacters of the vessel and cargo remain as distinct in this as in any other case.
The sent,nc, therefore, of the Circuit Court must be reversed, and the property claimed by Manuel Pinto for himself and his partners, and for those other Spaniards for whom he has claimed, be restored, and the libel 'as to
that Property, be dismisped.

Jon,-soN, J. Circumstances, known to this Court, have imposed upon me, in a great measure, the responsibility of this decision. I approach the case with nil tho hesitation which respect for the opinion of othdrs and a convictio'n'of the novelty and importance of sonie of the
questions are calculated to inspire. The same respect imposes upon me an obligation briefly to state the course of reasoning by which I am led to my conclnsion.

On the minor points I feel no difliculty. There is nothing to support the charge of English domiciliation;
the-charges of prevarication are satisfactorily explained' and.on the question of nitional character, we must yet awhile reluctantly yield to the acknowledgement that Buenos Ayres is not free.

On the constrtiction of the Spanish treaty, I feel as little hesitation. That a stipulation calculated solely.to produce an extension of neutral rights, should involve in
itself a restriction of neutral rights ; that a mutual and gratuitoug concession of a belligerent right, should draw afteri it a necessary relinquishment of a neutral right, which hAs never yielded but to express and (generally) extorted stipulation; are conclusiops wholly irreconcilable"to any priciple of logical deduction.

Nor does the argument tounted on reciprocity stand on any better ground. There is a principle of recipro-
city known to Courts administering inter-national lawt; but I trust it is a reciprocity of benevolence, and that the angry passions which produce revenge and retaliation
will never exert their influence on the administration of

justice. Dismal would be the state of the worldi and melancholy the office of a judge, if all the evils which the perfidy and injustice of power inflict on individual
man, were to be reflected from the tribunals which profess peace and good will to all mankind. Nor is it easy
to see how this principle of reciprocity, on the broad scale by which it has been protracted in this case, can be reconciled to the distribution of power made in our constitution among the three great departments of government. To the legislative power alone it must be-
long to determine when the violence of other nations
is to be met by violence. To the judiciary, to administer law and justice as it is, not as it is made to be by the folly or caprice of other nationS.

The last question in the case is the only one on which I feel the slightest difficulty.

The general rule, the incontestible principle is, that
a neutral has a right to employ a belligerent carpier. He exposes himself thereby to capture and detention, 'but not to condemnation.

To support the condemnation in this case, it is neces. sary to establish an exception to this rule and if is itnportant to lay down the exceptions, contended for, with truth and precision. -
In the first place, it is contended that a neutral has not a iight to transport his goods on board of an armed belligerent.

Secondly, that if thirright be conceded, Pinto, in this case, has carried the exercise of it beyond Ihe duties of
fair neutrality;

1. By laying the vessel under the obligation of a coiltract to sail with convoy:

2. By chartering an entire armed vessel of the enemyp and thus expediting an armed hostile force :

3. By taking in enemy goods on freight, apd thereby laying himself under an implied contrAct that the ar.
mament of the vessel should be used in its defence :

5. That the correspondence, fbund on board, shews that the armament was immediately directed against

capture by Americans.

On the first and pfincipal ground much may be said, but nothing added to the ingenious discussion which it has received from counsel.

The question is, why may not a neutral transport his goods on board an armed belligerent? No writer on the law of nations has suggested this restriction on his rights ; and it can only be sustained 6n the ground of its obstructing the exercise of some belligerent right. What belligerent right does it interfere with ? Not the right of search, for that has relation to the converse case; it is a right resulting from the right of capturing enemy's goods in a neutral bott;,m. It must be then the right, which every nation asserts, of being the sole arbiter of its own conduct towards other natuons, and deciding for itself, whether property, claimed as neutral, be owned as claimed. The question is thus rairly stated between the neutral and belligerent. On the ona hand, the neutral claims Ole right of transporting his g'oods in the hostile bottom: On the other, the beliigerentubjects to his doing it under such circumstances as to impair his right of judging., between himse!f and the neutral, on the nenltrality of his property and conduct. The evidence of authority, the practice of the world, and the reason and nature of things must decide between them.

All these are, in my opinion, in favor of the neutral claim.
Every writer on inter-national law acknowledges the right of the neutral to transport his goods in a hostile bottom. No writer has restricted the exercise of that right to unarmed ships.

Every civilized nation (with the exception of Spain) has unequivocally acknowledged the existence of this right, unless it be relinquished by express stipulation

VOL. IX.

SUPREME COURT I. S.
T E andeven with regard to Spain, the evidence is wholly xBznRnnx, unsatisfactory to prove that she maintains a different BFNETT, doctrine. My present belief is, that she doe not; but. MASTER. admit that she ddes ; and surely the practice of one na-
tion; and that one not the most enlightened or commercial, ought not to be permitted to control the law of the world.
And what is the decision of reason on the merits of these coriflicting pretensions ?
Her first and favorite answer would be, that were the cales equally suspended between the parties, the decision ought to be given in favor of humanity;
Already is the aspect of the world sufficiently darkened by the horrors of war. It is time to listen to the desponding claims of man engaged in the peaceful pursuits of life.
But there are considerations in favor of the neutral to which the heart need not assent; they are addressed to the judgment alone.
Admit the. claim of the belligerent, and you fritter a~vay the right of the neutral until it is attenuated to a vision.
Admit the claim of the neutral and it is attended with a very immaterial change in therights and interests of the belligerent.
Where are we to draw the liie ? If a vessel is not to be armed, what is to amount to an exceptionable armament? It extends to an absolute and total privation of the right of arming a hostile ship. Resistance, and even capture, is lawful to any belligerent that is attacked.
On the other hand, what injury is done to the belligerent by recognizing the right of the neutral ? Tie car. go of a belligerent neither adds to nor diminishes his right to resit. If empty lie must be subdued before he can he possessed ; and. if laden, the" right or faculty, of resistsnce is in no wise increased. It is inherent ii her nktional character, and can be exercised by strict right, without any reference to 'the cargo that sh con-

FEBRUAR Y TERU181.
tains, Suppose the case of a vessel and cargo wholly T.UE neutral; even she possesses a natural right to resist NEnE1DE, seizure; but her resistance must be effectual, or inter- BENNiETTt national law pronounces her forfeited. What injury re- SIASTEIL suits to the belligerent cruizer ? If the cargb be really neutral, the exercise of his right of judging becomes inmaterial; and if it be contraband, or otlerwisr subject to condemnation, what reason in nature can be assigned why the-neutral owner should not throw himself upon the fortune of war, and rely upon the protection of your enemy ? You treat him as an enemy, if .captured, and why should not he regard you as an enemy, and provide for his defence against you ? I can very well conceive that a case may occur in which it may become the policy of this country to throw down the gauntlet to the world and-assert a different principle. But the policy of these States is submitted to the wisdom of the legistuare, and I shall fe7l myself bound by other reason,; until the constitutional power shall decide what modifications it will prescribe to the exercise of any acknowledged neutral right.
The second ground of exception resolves itself into several points, and presents to my mind the greatest difficulties in the.case.
1. There is a stipulation contained in the charter-
party that the vessel shall sail with convoy.
2. Pinto chartered the whole vesscl.
s. He took in sub-affreightment of hostile goods.
4. It is contended he had contributed to the arming and manning of the vessel after chartering her.
5. And that her equipment was pointedly againt American capture.
With regard to the two latter points I am of opinion that the evidence does not prove that Pinto contributed to the armament of the vessel; and if she was armed by the owners, that it was against American capture is immaterial. As to the passenger5, Pinto had no con. trol over the reception of them into the vessel. Re lad

MASTER.

With regard to the three other points, after the best conhidiration that I have been able to give the subject, I satisfy my mind by two considerations.

1. I will not now give an opinion upon the abstract ease of an -individual neutrad to all the world. It is known that'Pinto was liable to capture both by the
French and Carthagenians. This justified h;m in placing himself under British protection ; and if, in the exercise of this unquestionable right, ho 'has incidentally impaired the exercise of ou' right of seizure for adjudi-
cdtion;\we have nothing to complain of. The case occurs daily ; and nothing but candor and fairness can be exacted of a neutral under such circumstances.

2. There appears to prevail much misconception with regard to the control acquired by Pinto, in this vessel,
under the chatter parry. uis contva'at gave him the occupation of -the hold of the vessd and two births in the cabin ; but went no farlher. Over the conduct of the
rnaster and crew, in navigating or defending the vessel, it communicated to ti'm no power. It is true that by the condact of the master and the fate of the vessel, he might
be ;iicidenially affected as astzb-freighter, and so fAir he hmtd an iit6rest in her defence; still, however, it is redu:'iblo to the goneral interest which lie hAd in the pr'formauce
of the voyage, and it does not appear that he ever acted utder an idea of being authorized to control the, conduct of the captain, or took any part in the conflict which preceded the capture.

I am of opinion that the judgment shoult be reversed and the property restored.

STORY, J. My opinion will be confined to the point last argued because it definitively disposes of the cause
against the claim of Mr. Pinto.

The facts material to this point are that Mr. Pinto chartered the Nereide, an uncommissioned armed ship belonging to British subjects, for a voyagefrom London

FEBRUARY TERM 181.

437

to Buenos Ayres, and back to London at a stipulated THE frc,,ght. The ship was to be. navigated during the voy- h-EuP.Ir age at the expense of the. general owner, who expressly BnETTr9 covenafited, in the charter-party with Mr. Pinto, that '.AsTrE.R she. should sail on the voyage under BI.itisih convoy.
Mr. Pinto, havingthus hired the whole ship, took on board. sundry shipments, partly on his own or Spanish account,
and partly on account of British merchants from whom he was to receive, in lieu of freight, aportion of the profits and commissions. The M-.re'de sailed with her car-
go itndef British convoy. ahd with instructions from the owner to the master to govern himself, in relation to the
objects of the charter-party, according to the direction of Mr. Pinto who accompanied the ship in the voyage. During~ te'passage to Buenos Ayres, the NereidLe was accidentally separated from the convoy, and, while endeavoring to regain it, was, after a vigotous but unsuccessful resistance, captured by the l;rivateer Governor Tompkins, and brought into New York for adjudication.

It is expli.itly asserted, inthe testimony, that fr. Pinto took no part in the resistance at the time of the capture.

The question is, whether, upon these farts, Mr. Pinto, assuming him to be, a netltral, has so incorporated himself with the enemy interests as to fo feit that protection wuch the neutral character would otherwise aflbrd him.

The general doctrine, though formerly subject to many learned doubts, is now in:"ntrovertibly established,
that neutral goods may be lawfully Ipt on board of an enemy ship without being prize of war. A.s this doc-
trine'is asserted in the most broad And unqualified manner in publicists, it is thence attempted to be inferred,
by the counsel for theClaimant, that no distinction can exist whether the ship be armed or unarmed, or be cap-
tured with or without resistance-aramnents of this sorl are.liable to many objections, and are in general wholly -unsatisfactory. Elementary writers rar.-ly explain the principles of public law with the minute distinctions which legal precision requires. Many of the mst im-
portant doctrineq ofthe prize Courts w ill not be found to
be treat-d of, or even glanced at. in the elaborate treatises of Groties, or Puffendorr, or Vattel. A striking illustration is their total ilencC as to the illegality and pe-

THE nal consequences of a trade with the' public enemy. N'E1tMDin, Even Bynkershoek, who writes professedly on prize B.FNNETT, law, is deficient in many important doctriues which eveMASTER, ry day regulate the decrees of prize tribunals. *And the
complexity of modern commerce has added incalculably to the number as well as, the intricady'of questions of national law., In what publicist are to be found the doc-
trines as to the iltega.ty of'cirrying enemy dispatches, and of eiigaging in the coasting, fishing, or other privileged trade of the enemy? Where are transfers iu transitupronounced to be illegal ? Where are accurately
and systematically stated all the circumstances which impress upon the neutral a general, or a limited, hostile. character, either by reason of his domicil, his territorial
possessions, or his connexion in. a house of trade, in the enemy country ? The seafch would be nearly in vain in the celebi-ated Jurists whose authority has been quoted. to silence the present enquiry. Yit the argumentwouldbe no less forcible that these doctrines have not a legal existence because not founA!in systematic treatises on-the
law of nations, than that which has been so earnestlr pressed upon us by tli counsel for the Claimants. The
assumed inference is then utterly inadmissible. The question before the Court must be settled upon other
grounds; upon- a just application 'of the principles
which regulate neutrdl, as well as belligerent, rights and
duties. Let-us then proceed to consider thenm:-

It is a clear maxim.of'national law that a neutral is bound to a perfect impartiality as to all the belligerents.
If he.incorporate himself into the measures or policy of
either; if lie become auxiliary to the enterprizes or ,dts of either, he forfeits his neutral characer-nor is this all.
In relation to'his commerce le is bound to subr .t to the belligerent right of searchland lie cannot lawfully adbpt any measures whos6 dir.ct object is to withdraw ,that commerce from the most liberal and accurate search
without the applidation on-the part of the belligerent of superior force. If he resist this exercise of laviful right,
or if, with a view, toresist it, lie take theprotection of iu armed neutral convoy, he is ,4eated as an enemy, and his property is. confiscated. Nor is it at all material whether the resistance be direct or constructive. The xesistance of the convoy is the resistance of all the ships
associated under the common protection, without any

FE BRUARY TERAI I85.
distinction whether the convoy belong to the same or to TIM a foreign, neutral sovereign-for upon tlhe principles of stamina, natral justice, a neutral is justly chargeable with the UBNrF.T, acts oitlhe party:. which' he voluntarily adopts, or, of ,ST
which he seeks the shelter and protection. quz sentit . conintdum seattre debet ct onus-these prIhciples are recoguized in the memorable cases of th'Jfaria,I' Rob.
S19, awl the Elgebe, 5, Pob. 173; ant can never be shaken without delivering over to endless controversy and conflict the maritime rights bf the world.
It has however been supposed, by the counsel of the Claimants, that a distiiction exists between taking the protection of aneutral, and of abelligerent, convoy. That in the former case all armament for resistance is unlawful; but in the latter case it is not only lawful but'in tto highest degree commendable. That although an unawfut act, as resistance by a neutral convoy, may justly arfeet the whole associated ships; yet it is otherwise of a lawful act, as resistance of a belligerent ship, for no fore feiture .canreasonably grow out of such an act which is strictly justifiable.
The fallacy of the argument consists in assuming the very grohnd in controversy; aud in confounding things; in their own nature entirely distinct. An act perfectly lawful in a belligerent, may be flagrantly wrongful-it a neutral. A belligerdnt may lawfully resist search ; a neutral is hound to submit to it. A belligerent upay carry on his commerce by force; a neutral cannot A. belligerent may capture the property of his enemy on the ocean ; a neutral has no'autliority whatever to make captures. Tile same act, therefore, that, with reference to the rights and duties of the one, may be tortious, may, with reference to the'rights and duties of'the other,. be perfectly justifiable.. The act then, as.-to its character, is to be judged of, not merely by that of the parties, through whose immediate instrumentality it is done; but also by the character of those, who, having co-operated in, assented to, or sought protection from, it, would yet withdraw themselves from the penalties of the act. It -is-analogous to the case at common law where an act, justifiable in one party, does not, from that,'ract-alone, shelter his coadjutor. They must stand or fall upon

SUPREME COURT U. S,
VRE their own merits. It wguld be strange indeed, if, be·EREIDE, cause a belligerent may kill his enemy,, a neutral may IBENNETT, aid in the act; or because a belligerent may resist search, MASTER. a neutral may co-operate to make it elfectual. It is
therlefore an ssunmption, utterly inadmissible, that anutral can avail himself of the lawful act of an enemy to protect hiwseltf in an evasion of a clear belligerent right.
And what reason can there be for the distinction confended for? Why is the resistance of the. convoy deemed the resistance of the whole neutral associated ships. let them belong to whom they may ? It is not that there isa direct and immediate co-operation in the resistance, because the case supposes the contrary. It is not that the resistance of the convoy of the sovereign is deemed an act to which all his own subjects consent, because the ships of foreign subjects would then be exempted. 'itis because there is a constructive resistance resulting ilt law from the common association and voluntary protiex tion against search unler a furi knowledge of the intentions otthe convoy ? Then the pliJciple alphes as ,.ell to a belligerent 4s to a neutral convoy ? For it is nmtifest that the belligerent will at all evonts resist search; and it is quite as manitlest that the neutral seeks belligerent protectiunwith an intent to evade it. Is it that an evasion of search, by.the employment, protection or, terror of force, is inconsisteot with neutral duties? Then afortiorithe principle applies to a case of bellige. rent convoy, for the resistance mast be preshmed to be more obstinate and the search more perilous.
There can be but little doubt that it is upon the latter principles that the penalty of confiscation is applied to neiutrals. The law proceeds yet farther and deems the sailing tinder convoy as an act per se inconsisttent with neutrality, as a premeditated attempt to oppose, if practicable, the right of search, and thefrer attributes to such preliminary act, the full effect of actual rests. tane. In this respect it applies a rule analoqous to thatin cases of blockade, where the act of sailing w.'itli an intent to break a blockade is deemed a sufficient breach to authorize confiscation. And sir W. Scott nianif-stly recognizes the correctness of this doctrine in the Maria,

FEBRUARY TERM Ism1.

although the circumstances of that case did not require T/Th

its rilgorous application.

N PEImE,

33EYfl'ETT.
Indeed, in relation to a neutral convoy, th evidence of BU5E.R. an intent to resist, as well as of constructive resistance, is far more equivocal 'than in case of a belligerent convoy. In the latter case it is necessaily known to the

convoyed ships that the belligerent is bound to resist

and will resist until overcome by superior force. It is impossible therefore t(. join such convoy without an 'itention to receive the protection of belligerent foice in

such manner and uider such circumstances as the belligerent may choose to apply it. It is an adoption of

his acts, and an assistance of his interests during the as-

sumed voyage. To render the convoy an effectual protection, it is necessary to interchange signals and in-

structions, to communicate information, and to watch

the approach of every enemy. The neutral solicitously aids and co-operates in all these important transactions,

and thus far manifestly sides with the. belligerent and performs, as to him, a meritorious service-a service as

little reconcileable with neutral duties, as the agency of a spy, or the fraud of a bearer of hostile dispatches.

In respect to a neutral convoy the inference of constructive co-operation and hostility is far less certain and direct. To condemn, in such case, is pushing the doctrine to a great extent, .since it is acting upon the presumption, which is not prrmitted to be contradicted, that

all the convoyed ships distinctly understood and adopted the objects of the convoy, and intimately blended their own interests with hostile resistance.

There is not, then, the slightest reason for the favora-

ble distinction, as to the belligerent convoy, assumed by

counsel. On the contrary, every presumption of hos-

tility is, in such case, more violent, and every suspicion

of unneutral conduct more inflamed. And so in the ar-

gument of the Maria, i llob. 346, it was conceded by

the counsel for the Claimants, and recognized by the

Court. It was there, said by counsel that it seemed ad-

mitted by the Court on a former day that there was a

just distinction to be made between the two cases of con-

voy, viz: between the convoy of an enemy's force, anti

a neutral convoy; that the former (i. e. enemy convoy) would stamp a prinzari characterof hostility on all shi ps

sailing under its'protection, and it would rest on tile parties to take themselves out of the presumption raised against them ; but that, even in that case. itwould b.' nothingmoro than a presunlption, which had been determined by a late case before the Lords, the Sampson, Barne,
ani asserted American ship sailing with French cruizers at the time they engaged some English shils, and, ommunicating with the French ships by signal for battle.
That, in that case, although there had been a condemnation in the Court below, the Lords sent it to farther proof to ascertain whether there had' been an actual resistance. 'Sir Win. Scott emphatically observed, ,iI do , not admit the authority of that cise to the extent to
"which you push.it. Thatquestion :isstill reserved. ,although the Lords might Nish to know, as much of "the facts as possi6le." It isclear, from this language,
that the learned judge did not admit that the patuty could be legally permitted to coritradict the presumption of hostility attached to the sailing under an enemy convoy. On the contrary, he seemed to consider that the prima-
ry character of hostility, which, it was conceded on all sides, was stamped upon such conduct, could, hot be permitted to be rebutted, but was conclusive upon tie par.
ty. The case of the Sampson was originally heard be. fore the Court of vice admiralty, and the decree of con-
demnation was never disapproved of, if not 'ultimately afflimed, by the Lords of Appeal. I have been assured by very respectable authority that no proof of actual resistance ever was, or could have been, made on the final
hearing. ,The case, therefore, afrn'ds a steong inference of the law as understood and administered in the prize Courts of Great Britain.

And it may be added, in corroboration, that in Stuart V.Wo'; S T. R. 323, 332, sir W. Scott (then advocato general) asserted, without hesitation, that if the neutral
refused search, or sailed tinder convoy of the enemy's ships of war, or conveyed intelligence to the enemy, they are wavers of tile rights of neutrality. The. very
circumstance of his putting these three cais in connoxion to illustrate his general argument, affords the most cogent proof that he considered himself as statin.; a doctrine equally clear and well established as to all of themnd-

Since this opinion was delivered I find, by an account of all the appeals, -nd final deciions thereon before the lords of' appeal, published by order oV

FEBRUARY TERM MSig.
And this doctrine seems conformable-to the sense of TmE other European sovereigns. In the recent cases of the !rn.DE, American ships captured while under British convoy by EM,.RT.T the Danes, the right of coudemnation was not only as- MAsTEn. serted and enforced by the highest tribunal of prize, but expressly affirmed by the Danish sovereign after an earnest appeal made by the government of1he United Statets. On that occasion the Danish minister piessed the argument " that he who causes himself to be prod,tected by that act, (i. e. enemy convoy) ranges him6,self on the side of the protector, and thus puts himself ",in opposition to the enemy of the protector, and evi"cdently renounces the advantages attached to the cha-c racter of a friend to him against whom he seeks the "cprotection. If Denmark should abandon this princi" ple, the navigators of all nations would find their ac" count in carrying on the commerce of Great Bi-!tain. " under the protection of English ships of war without " any risk ;" and he further declared ., that none of the "cpowers in Europe have called in question the justice " of this principle." State papers, 1811, p. 597.
It cannot be denied that our own government have acquiesced in the truth ad correctness of this statement. And if to the general silence of the other European sovereigns we add the possitive examples of Great Britain and Denmark, (the latter of whom has not of late years been deficient in zeal for neutral rights) it seems difficult to avoid the conclusion that the doctrine is as well founded in national law, as it seems to me to be in justice and sound policy.
Another argument which has been urged in favor of the assumed distinction ought not, however, to be omitted. It is that a party, neutral as to one power, may be

TILE an enemy as to another power, and lie may lawfully .EREIDpEla,ce himself under belligerent convoy to escape from
NENnETT, his own enemy. In such a predicament it is, therefore, MASTER. always open to the neutral to explain his conduct in
taking convoy, and to show, by proofs, his innocent intentions as to all friendly belligerents. In my judgment this supposed state of thin.s would not remove a single difficulty.
it is not in relation to enemies that the question as to taking convoy can ever arise. It has reference only to the rights of friendly belligerents ; and these rights remain precisely the same whatever may be the peculiar situation of. he neutral as to third parties. Was it ever hard of that a neutral might lawfully resist the right of search of one power, because he was at war with another? And is not the evasion of this right just as injurious wh~ether thu neutral be atpeace with all the world, or with a part only ?
There would be extreite difficulty in establishing, by any disinterested testimony, the fact of any such special intentions as the ar.gumcnt supposes. Independent of this difficulty, it would. in effect, be an attempt tolrepol, by positive testimony, a conclusive inference of law flowing from the very act of taking convoy. The bellige. rent convoy is bound to resist all visitations by enemy ships, whelthcr neutral to the convoyed ships or not. This obligation is distinctly known to the party taking its protection. If, therefore, he, choose to continue under the convoy, he shows an intention to avail himseit of its protection tinder all the chances and hazards of -war. The abandonment of such intention cannot ,be otherwise evidentd than by the overt act of quitting convoy. And it is impossible to conceive that the mere
secret -wishes or private declarations of a party could prevail over his own deliberate act of continuing under convoy, unless Courts of prize would surrender themselves to the most stale excuses and imbecile artificps. It would be in vain to a ,minister justice in such Court, if mere statements of intention would outweigh the legal effects of the acts of the parties. Besides, the injury to the friendly belligerent is'equally great whatever might be the special objects of the neutral. The right of search is effectually prevented by the presence of an-

FEBRUARY TERM iSiM.
perior force, or exercised only after the perils and inja- THE ries of victorious warfare. And it is this very evasion NXfLEIDE of the right of search that constitutes the ground of con- BF-ETT, demnation in ordinary cases. The neutral, in effect, MASTE. declares that he will not submit to search until the ene- -my convoy is conquered,-and then only because he cannot avoid it. The special intention of the neutral then could not, if proved, upon principle prevail, and it has not a shadow of authority to sustain it. The argument upon this point.was urged in the Maria and Elsebe, and was instantly repelled by the Court.
On the whole, on this point my judgment is, that the act of sailing under belligerent or neutral convoy is of itself a violation of neutrality, and the ship and cargo if caught in delictoarejustly confi-cable; and further, that if resistance be necessary, as in my opinion it is not, to pgrfect the offence, still that the resistance of the convoy is to all purposes the resistance of the associated fleet. It might, with as much propriety, be maintained that neutral goods, guarded by a hostile army in their passage through a country, or. voluntarily lodged in a hostile fortress, for the avowed purpose of evading the municipal rights and regulations of that country, should not in case of capture he lawful plunder, (a pretension never yet asserted) as that neutral property on the ocean should enjoy the double protection of war and peace.
If these principles be correct, it remains to be considered how far the conduct of ir. Pinto brings !lin within the range of their influence. It is clear that in the original concoction of the voyage it was his intention to avail himself of British convoy. The covenant in the charter party demonstrates this intention; a covenant that, from its terms, being made by the ship owner, must have been inserted for the benefit and at the instance of the charterer. Under the faith of this stipulation Mr. Pinto put his own property on board and received shipment from persons of an acknowledged hostile character. The ship sailed on the voyage, under British convoy, with Mr. Pinto on board, and though captured after a separation from the convoy, she was in the very attempt to rejoin it. There is no pretence, therefore, of an abandonment of the convoy, and the

SUPREME COURT U. S.
THE. corfJts delicti, the chiarccter of hostility, impressed by ERFAnIDE, the sailing under convoy, if any attached, remained notBENNETT, withstanding the separation. It is like the sp.lllng for a MASTER. blockaded port, where the offence continues, although at
the moment of capture the ship be, by'stress of'wcather, driven in a direction fron the port of destination;' for the hostile intention stil remains unchanged.
And here to avoid the effiect of the general doctrine, we are met with another distinction founded upnn the ,-upposed difference between a belligerent and a neutral merchant ship as to the taking of convoy. It is argoted that the belligerent ship has an undoubted right to take the protection of the ?onvoy of the nation to which she belongs; and that this extends a perfect and lawful imIiunity to the neutral cargo on board.
It is certainly incumbent on the counsel for the Clhimant to support this exception to the general rule by precedent or analogy. Nothing has been offered which, in my judgme'nt, affords it the slightest support. It is not true that a neutral ran shelter his property from confiscation behind an act lawful in a belligerent. The law imputes to the neutral the consequences of the act if he might have foreseen and guarded against it, or if lie voluntarily adopts it. Was it ever supposed that a neutral cargo was protected from seizure by going in a belli.gerent ship to a blockaded port? or that contraband goods, belonging to a neutral, were exempted from confiscation because on board of such a shipbound on a .yoyage lawful to the belligerent, but not to the neutral? ,yet th6 pretensions in these cases seem scarcely more extravagant than that now urged. Why should a neutral be permitted to do that indirectly which he is prohiibited from doing directly? Why should lie aid th6 enemy by giving extraordinary freight for belligerent ships sailing under belligerent bonv6y vith the avowed p.urpose .. f escaping from search, arid often with the concealed inilention of aiding belligerent commerce, and yet claim the benefits of the most impartial conduct? Until some more solid ground can be laid for the"distinction than the ingenuity of counsel has yet suggested, it would seem fit to declar. ita lea non scripta est.
But even if the distinction existed, it could not apply

FEBRUARY TERM ism5.
to the case at bar. This is a case where the, Claimanf Tirz becomes the charterer of the whole vessel for the voy- KfnUmDm, age and stipulates for the express benefit, of convoy. JENSIT-i The ship, though navigated by a belligerent master and MASTER. crew, was necessarily under the -ontrol and manage- ment of the charterer. He was the real effective dux negotii. . Whatever may be the technical doctrine of the common or prize law as to the general property in the ship,, the charterer -was, to all purposes important in this enquiry, the owner for the voyage, and the master his agent. Can there"be a doubt that, as to the shipments of the enemy freighters, Mr. Pinto was responsible for th6 acts of the master? Was he not materially interested in the safety and protection of'these shipments" in respect to freight, commissions and profits ? If they had been, lost by capture, from the negligence of Mr. Pinto or of the master, when by ordinary diligence and resistance the loss might have been avoided, would not -Mr. Pinto have been rcspopsible? How then it can be consistently held that the ship was not essentially governed and managed by Mr. Pinto, and all hev conduct incorporated with his interests, I profess to be unable to comprehend. For what pprpose should he insist on a covenant for convoy, if lie never meant to derive aid and protection from it to the whole cargo on board, and to range himself and his interests on the side of resistance? His private conduct at the time of the capture, when resistance was almost hopeless, affords no 6vidence to repel the irresistible presumptions -fromhis deliberate acts.
And here again ?t has been argued that Mr. Pinto had no hostile intentions against the United States; but that the taking of convoy was simply to resist the French and Carthagenians, who are the encinies of his own couhtry. If such special intention could, in point of law,uphold his claim which, fur the reasons already stated, I am entirely satified it conld not, yet there is not, in the present case, within my recollection, any proof of such special intention. It rests upon tie mere suggestions of counsel. How, indeed, could Mr. Pinto show that he meant to yield his property to the search ot the cruizers of the United States, when the deliberate act of assuming British convoy precluded the possibility of its exercise, unless acquired by victory atLer resistance?

SUPREME COURT U, S.

TiN If this view of the case be correct, it must be proNEREIDJE, nounced that Mr. Pinto, by voluntarily sailing under BEqNNETT, convoy, forfeited his neutrality, and bound his property MASTERt. to an indissolubly hostile character.

This, however, is not the only ground upon which
the claim of Mr. Pinto ought to be repudiated. There was not merely the illegality of sailing under enemy convoy up to the very eve of capture, but the fact bf
actual resistance of the chartered ship, and submission to search only in c-nsequence of superior force.

An attempt,, however, is made to extract tile case at bar, from the penalty of confiscation attached to resistance of search, upon the ground that Mr. Pinto took no
part in this resistance. It is asserted, that a shipper In a general ship is not affected by the act of the enemy naster; that the charterer of the whole ship is entitled to as favorable a consideration ; and that there is no difference, in point of law, whether the ship have, or
have not a commission, or be, or be not armed. It will be necessary to give to these positions a full examina. tion.

In the first place, it is to be considered whether a neu. tral shipper has. a right to put his property on board of
an armed belligerent ship without violating his neutral duties. If the doctrine already advanced on the subject of convoy be correct, it is incontestible that he has no such right. If he. cannot take belligerent convoy, a for-
tiori he cannot put his property on board of such convoy; or, what is equivalent, on board of an armed and
commissioned ship of the belligerent. What would be the consequences if neutrals might lawfully carry on all
their commerce in the frigates and ships of war of another belligerent sovereign ? That there would be a perfeet identity of interests and of objects, of assistance and of immuiity,- between the parties. The most gross frauds and hostile enterprizes would be carried on under neutral disguises, and the right of search would become
as utterly insignificant in practice as if it were extinguished by the common consent of nations. The extravagant premiums and freights which neutrals could well afford to pay for this extraordinary protection would enable the belllgerent to keep up armaments of incalcu.

lable size, to the dismay and ruin of inferior maritime T'ZH powers. Such false and hollow neutrality would be hN-nfrlW, infinitely more injurious than the most active warrare. BE.N!ETT, It would strip from the conqueror all the fruits of vic- m~sATE~i. tory, and lay them at thc feet of those whose singular -merit would consist in evading his rights, if not in collusively aiding his enemy. It is not therefore to be ad-
mitted that a neutral may lawfully place his goods under armed protection, on board of an enemy ship. Nor can it be at all material whether such armed ship be
commissiomnd or not: that is an affair exclusively between a sovereign and his own subjects, but is utterly
unimportant to the neutral. For lether thearmnament be employed for offence, or for defence, in respect totlird
parties, the peril and the obstruction to the right ofsearch areequally com, plete. 1Noris ittrue, as has beenassertedin
argument, that a non-commissioned armed bltip has )3o right to capture an enemy ship, except in her own dofence. The act of capture without such pretext, so far
from being piracy, would be strictly justifiable upon the law of nations, however it might stand upon the mu-
nicipal law of the country of the capturing ship. Vattel has been quoted to the contrary; but on a careful ex-
amination, it will be found that his text does not warrant
the doctrine.

I have had Occasion to consider this point in another cause, in this Court, and to the opinion then delivered I refer for a more full discussion of it. If the sulbect capture without a commission, he can acquire no property to himself in the prize; and if the act be contrary to the regulations of his own so.vereign, lie may be liable
to municipal penalties for his conduct. But as to the enemy he violates no rights by the capture. Such, on an accurate consideration, will be found to be the doctsine of Puffendorf, and Grotius, and Bynkershoek, and they
stand confirmed by a memerable decision of the lords of appeal, in 1759. 2 Brown's civil 'and adin. app. 562-Grotiuslib. S, ch. 6, s. 8, 9, i0-andBarbegracs note on S. 8, Puffeudorf,lib. 8, ch. 6, s. 2i, 4c. Bynk. 2, P. J. ch. 3, ,, 16,17. 2 Woodes. lect. 432. Consol. de.?larecl. 287

missible) that a fieutral may lawfully ship his goods on board the armied ship of an enemy, it will be o' little avail, unless he. is exempted from the consequences of all the acts of such en'iy. If the shipment be innocent, it uxili he of Hide avail ill this case, if the resistence of
the enemy mn.ster will compromit the nfeutral character
of the dargo. To the eslablislLment, therefore, of such an exemption, the exertions of coiotscl have been stren'-
ously du'tected. It has been inferred from the silence of el.umentarv writers, from the authority of analagous cases, and fron the positive declmtrations of the Court, in the CathriaElizabtth, 5 Rob. .206.

The arqitraent drawn from the silence of Jurists ]IRs been already sufficiently answered. It remains to consider th-at which is urged upon the fooming of authority.
Tie reasoning from supposed analagous cases is quite as unatisfaotory. It is not true, as to neutrals, that the act of the master never binds the owner of the cargo unless
th master is proved to be the actual agent of the owner. The act of the master may be, and very often is, conclu-
sive upon the cargo, although no general agency is es-
tablishpd. Suppose he violate a blockade, 'suppress and fraudulently destroy ,he ship's papers, or mix up under the same cover enemy interests, will not the cargo share the fate of th- ship ? The cases cited are mere ex-
ceptions to the general rule. They, in general, turn upbn a settled distinction, that the act of the master shall not bind the cargo, where the act under the circumnstaies
could not have been within the scope or contemplation of the shipper at the time of shipment; or where llis ignorance of the voyage,, and of the intended acts of the
master, is placed beyond the possibility of doubt. See Vi'e qdons, 5 Rob. 256. The Very case of resistance is a strong illustration of the principle. The resistance of the neutral master, has been deliberately held to be conclusive on the neutral cargo. The Rizebe, 5 Rob. 173. The Catherina Elizabeth, 5 Rob. 206. What reason can there be for a different rule in respect to a belligerent master?

If must be admitted that the language of the Court in the case of the Catherina Elizabeth Would at first view, seem to support the.position of the Claimant's,counsel.
On a close examination, however, it will not be found to

FEBRUARY TERI 18iM.
assert so broad a doctrine. The. case was of a res t e ThE attempted by an enemy master having ,n board a nu NZRmEy tral cargo; and this rescue attempted, not of the captured. nuni.TT., but of the capturing,ship. It was arguen that this re- flASTEU. sistance of the master exposed the whole car.go. entrustdd to his management, to confiscation. The Court held that no such penalty was incurred. That the r-sistance could only be the hostile act of a hostile person who was a prisoner of -war, and who, unless under parole, liad a perfect right to emancipate himself by seizing his own vessel. That the case of a neutral master differed from. that of an enemy master. No duty was violared by such an act on the part of the latter ; tupzim aurbus teneo, and if he could withdraw himself he had a right sc, to do. #hd that a inateritdfact in the case was, that the master did not attempt to withdraw his property, but to rescue the ship of thp captorand not his own vessel. Such was the decision of the Court, upon which several observations arise. In the first place the resistance was not made previous to the capture ; and therefore whatever may be the extent of the language, it must be restrained to the circumstances of the case in judgment, otherwise it would be extra.-judicial. In the next place it would be impossible to conceive how the fact, as to what vessel was seized, could be itateria!,if the argument of the present Claimant be correct, for in all events the resistance as to the cargo would be without any legal effects. In the last place it is clear, that the case is put by the Court upon the ground, that the master at the time of the act had been dispossessed of his vessel by capture, and was a prisoner of war. He was, therefore, no longer acting as master of the ship, and had no further management of her. His rights and duties, as master, had entirely ceased by the capture, and there could be no pretence to affect the ship or cargo with his subsequent acts, any more than with the acts of any other steang-r. The case would have been entirely different with a neutral master, whose relationto his shipcontinues itwithstandinga cap. ture and carrying in for adjudication. The case therefore admits of sound distinctions from that at bar, and cannot be admitted to govern it.
There is another text, n9t cited in the argument, which may be thought to favor the doctrine of the Claimant's counsel. It is the only passage bearing on the subject in

SUPREME COURT U. S.
Tim controversy which has fallen under my.notice in any NEREIDE, elementary work. Casaregis, in his commercial, disBENNETT, CoUrses, (Disc. 24, n.22) has the following remarks :MASTER. ccerum tamen notandum est quod si nuais ininica one.
,,ratainercibusmercatorum amicorum aggresgafierit atc teram inimicant et mercatores aut domini mercium ope. s ram ac industriurm dedissent pro ea aggredienda tunc -merces dominorun. cadunt etiam sub preda, si navis ,,predicta.onerata 7nercibus"fuerit deproedata, 4-c. 6-c. et cc regulariter bona eorum qui auxilium inimices nostris cc prwstant .%eel confederati cur Us sunt, prwdari pOSc sunt." It is obvilms that Casaregis is here considering the case of an attack of an enemy merchant ship, laden with a neutral cargo, upon the ship of its enemy in which the former is unsuccestful and is captured. Under such circumstances he holds, that if the neutral shippers, or the persons having the management or the cargo (doinini wercium) have aided in the attack, the cargo is forfeited, upori the ground that all who assist or confederate with an enemy are liable to bc pludered by the law of war. He does not touch the case, where an enemy merchant ship simply makes resistance in her own defence, or resists the right of search; nor how far the master of such ship is the dominus merclurn, or can by his own acts bind the cargo. Much less has he discussed the question as to what acts amount to an incorporation into the objects and interest- of the enemy, so as to affix a hostile character. It does not seem to me that his text can be an authority beyond the terms in which it is expressed. It pronounces affirmatively that a co-operation'in an attack will induce confiscation of the cargo, (which cannot be doubted;) butit-does not pronounce negatively that the resistance of an enemy master will not draw after it the same penalty. And if it were otherwise, it would deserve consideration whether the opinion of a mere elementary writer, respectable as he may be, delivered at a time when the prize law was not as well settled as it has been in the present age, should be permitted to regulate the maritime rights of belligerent nations.
The argument then, on the footing of authority, fails., for none is produced which directly',points at circumstances like those in the case at bnWr. And upon principleit seems quite is difficult to support it. f am unable

FEBRUARY TERM i15.
to.perceive any-solid foundation on which to re. a diis- TU. tinction bettwccn the resistance of a neutral and cf an VaER111DE, enciy waster. The injury to the belligerent is in both ukN.ETT,9 pases equally great, for it equally withdraws the neutral m.ibTt. property from the right of search, unless acquire-! by siperior.firce. And until it is established that an enemy protection legally, suspends the right of search, it cannot be that xesistance to such right should not be equally penal in each party. I have, therefore, no difficulty in holding that the resistance of the ship is, in all cases, the resistance of the cargo', and that it makes no difference whether she he armed or una,'ned, coramissioned or unc.nnmi-sioned. He who puts his property on the issue of battle, must stand or fall by the event of the qontest. The law of neutrality is silent when arms are appealed to in order to decide rights ; and the captor 'is entitled to the whole prize won by his gallantry and valor. This opinion is not the mere inference, strong :as it seems to me to be, of general reasoning. It is fortified by the consideration that in the earliest rudiments of prize law, in the, great maiitime countries of Great Britain and France, confiscation is applied by wa%%ofy penalty .for resistance of scarch to all vessels withont any discrimination of the natimial character of the vessels or cargp,.'. The black bouk of the admiralty expressly articulates that any vessel nakin. esi-tMnce may be attacked andf seized as enemies ; nd this Iule is caforced in the nienorable prze instructions of Henry N 11. Clerk'sPraxis 6k, Rol). Collect. .1farit.p. 10, and'note, aiul
p. H1S. The ordinance of France of 158t, is equally broad; and declares all such vassels good prize ; and this has ever since remained a settled rule in the prize code of that nation.
. r-alin informs us Ihat it is also the rule of Spain ; atil that in France it is applied as well to French"cessels and cargoes Ls t,those of neutrals, and allies, Col .Aarit, 118, 1-din Traits des 'rizfs, ch. 5, § 8, p. 80. There is not to be found in the maritime code of any nation, or in any commentary.threon, the least glimmering of antiority that distinguishes, in cases of resistance,the fate of the cargo, from that of the ship. If such a ditinction could have been sustained, it is almost incradible that not a siugle ray of light should have beamed upon it during the long lapse of.ages, in which maritime. war-

SUPREME COURT U. S.
THE fare has engaged the world. And if any argument is NEREIDE, to be drawn from the silence of authority, I know not BENNETT, under what circumstances it can be more forcibly apMASTER. plied than against the exception now contended for.
But even if it were conceded that a neutral shipper in a general ship might be protected, the concession would not assist the present Claimant. ,His interests were so completely mixed tip and combined with thb interests of the enemy; the master was so entirely his agent under the charter party, that it is impracticable to extract the case from the rule that stamps Mr. Pinto with a hostile character. The whole commercial enterprizo was radically tainted with a hostile leaven. In its very essence it was a fraud upon belligerent rights. I, for a moment, it could be admitted that a neutral might lawfully ship goods in an armed ship of an enemy, or might charter such a ship, and navigate her with a neu, tral crew, these admissions would fall far short of succouring the Claimant. He must successfully contend for broader doctrines, for doctrines which, in my humble judgment, are of infinitely more dangerous tendency than any which Schlegel and Hnbner, the champions of neutrality, have yet advanced iptothe field of maritime controversy. I cannot bring my mind to believe tfiat a neutral can charter an armed enemy ship, amid-ictual and man her with an. enemy creW, (for though fuinished directly by the owner they arc-iri effect paid and supported by the chartereri with the avowed knowledge and necessary intent that she should resist every enemy; that he can take on board hostile shipments on freight, commissions and profits; th'., he can stipulate expressly for the benefit and use of enemy convoy, and iiavigate during the voyage under its guns and protection;. that he can be the entire projector and conductor" of the voyage, and co-olprate in all the plans of the owner to render resistance to search secure and effectual ; and that yet, notwithstanding all this conduct, by the law of nations he may shelter his property from confiscation and claim -the privileges of an inoffensive neutral. On the contrary, it seems to me that such conluct is utterly irreconcileable with the good faith of a iriend, and unites all the qualities of the most odious hostility. It wears the hibiliments of neutrality only when the sword and the armour, of an enemy become

FEBRUARY TERA i.i.
useless for defence. If it be, as it undoubtedly is, a vi- TnZ olation of neutrality to engage in the transport service NEhn.DE of the enemy, or to carry his dispatches even on a neu- D3ENN.r.TT, tral voyage, how much more so must it be to inlist, all MASTER. our own interests in his service, and hire his arms and his crew in order to prevent the exercise of those rights which, as neutrals, we are bound to submit to ? The doctrine is founded in most perfect justice, that those who adhere to an enemy connexion shall share the fate of the enemy.
On the whole, in every view which I have been able f:o take of this subject, [ hin satisfied that the claim of Mr. Pinto must be rejected, and that his property is good prize to the captors. And in this opinion I am authorized to state that I have the concurrence of one of my brethren. It is matter of regret that in this conclusion I have the misfortune to differ from a niqority of the Court, for whose superior learning and ability I entertain the most entire respect. But I hold it an indispensable duty not to surrender my own judgment, bbcause a great weight of opinion it against me, a weight which no one can feel more sensibly than myself. Had this been an ordinary case I should have contented myself with silence.; but believing that no more important or interesting question ever came before a prize tribuhial, and that the national rights, suspended on it, are of infinite moment to the maritime world, I have thought it not unfit tW pronounce my'own opinion, diffident indeed of is fullness and accuracy of illustration, but en. tirely satisfied of the.rectitude of its principles.

& oAmxBELL.

That Law, knowing the Complainant's interest in the
property, and with intent to injure the Complainhults. and to benefit the Defendant, Campbell, on, the 4th of September, and 5th of October, 1797, exceuted two deeds
releasing to Morris, Nicholson and Greenleaf, part of
the mortgaged property, which had been attaqhed by
Campbell; which releases were executed by Law with
a full knowledge of the interest of the Complainants in the mortgaged property; in defiance of their express prohibition; and with a fraudulent intent to vest the
legal estate in Morris and Nicholson so as to give effect to the attachment of Campbell. That Campbell had engaged to indemnify Law for that act. That the releases were executed without the knowledge or consent of Morris, Nicholson and Greenleaf, or either of them, and were never delivered to them or either of them, but
were put on record by Law. The Complainants pray that those deeds of release may be vacated and annulled. They state that they are ready, able, and willing, to
carry into effect the contracts between Law and Morris, Nicholson and Greenleaf, and to do every thing that in justice and equity ought to be done on their part; but that Law has refused and neglected to build the houses, and to make his selection within the time limited, and out of the squares prescribed ; has violated his contract in setting up a claim and keeping the property mortgaged as a collateral -security for making him titles to property, which titles he has prevented by refusing to select the property, &c.

The bill requires Campbell to state when, from whom,
and atwhat price lie obtained the notes of Morris and Nicholson, upon which his attachment was issued; and prays, for general relief.

The answer of Law admits that he had received conveyances for " about 2,000,000 of square feet of ground
under the contract, but not within the time stipulated 0"it
states the number and kind ofhouses which be had built; denies that he was bound to receive conveyances with a

It states, also, that Morris and Nibholson assigricd Law's building contract to the commissioners of the city, and that the present Complainants are not the assignees thereof, nor have any interest therein ; and that if they had, their remedy is at law and not in equity.

LAW
& CA31riFra .

With regard to the releases of Sej texpber and Octo-
her, 1797, he says that the mortgaged property Nps more than aample security ; that Morris and Nicholfon,
were in' 1797, generally deemed bankrupts, that their creditors were suing out attachments, and he thought it
unjust to keep covered, by his mortgage, from fair creditors, a property so much more than enough to secure
his demands, and thierefore executed those releases. He admits that Campbell gave him a bond of indemnity,
but denies that he received any compensation. He admits als6 that one of the Complainants desired him not to execute them; but he disregarded the rquest.

Exceptions -having been taken to this answer, Mr. Law fied an amended answer, in which lie insists that he was released from his building contract because he had not r6ceived titles for all the lots ho had purchased; or that, as he had originally'fotr years from the date of the contract, to complete his buildingd, and was to have had his titles in 90 days, he ought to be allowed four years from the time of receiving hi titles. He affirms
that he made his selection, within the time limited by his contract, and exhibits a copy thereof. He avers that by the contract of March l0th, i79, he had a right to select as 'vell from, the property which Greeideafhad contracted to purchase in his own name from D. Carroll, as fromthat Which .llorrs awl Grcenleaf had contracted to purchase from the commissioners ol the city. That on -the l4th of Marchi 1796, after much trouble and' vexation he received his first conycyance of a part of his lots, amounting to 773,[22 square feet; to obtain which he had to release to Morris, Nicholqon and Greenl~af a part of the mortgaged property, viz. squares No.465,468,469,170, 495, and498. e avers that any variation which may appear between his original selection and the squares afterwards conveyed to him,

"t by squares out of any that are within our selection, al" though not chosen by you already, except water pro"cperty, or where we have since your selection, or be".fore improved on, or contracted for the sale of that -vwhich you desire; and we wish you now to name the ,squares, as the selection and titles shall be completed "for you without delay."
That in consequence of that letter he made another selection including other squares, and on the 20th of July, 1797, received another conveyance of lots from the commissioners containing 1,1-12,0684 square feet., That lie also r~ceived a debd dated January 28th, 1797, 'lirectly from Moris and Nicholson, for 128,223 square feet, the title to which has since been decided by the chancellor of Marylknd, not to have been in them but the commissioners of the city.
He also states that after receiving these three conviyances "lie had selected to have the residue of what was "cdue conveyed to him 'out' of the half of square 713, "square 699, and square 696, containing 314,829 squiare efeet, which, if the deed of January 28th, 1797, had " remained good would have 'been near the quota to "cwhich hewas entitled ; but the said squares, or the ,,proper portion ther'eof never were copnveyed, though "cthe 4aid Morris and Nicholson frequently promised so ",to do. That the said Squares were a part of the pro-. ,,perty which they had contracted to purchase of ti ,,,.'saC-darroll accordiig to their contract of th 26th of cc September, 1793 ;' (a copy of which isexhibited and appears to be a contract by Greenleaf alone, with Carroll.) He refers to a letter from Morris and Nicholson to him of the i9th of March, 1797, in which they say ,,.we are equally anxious with you to get Mr. Carroll "v.paid on his (Mr. Carroll's) account, upon our account, "dand upon your own account; and yet with all this anx,,iety we do not agree to sign the articles, which were

Carroll,say-in six weeks, and on your part to covecc nant therein, that upon so doing you will release to us ,our mortgage when Or. Carroll makes the riles." )Ic refers also to a letteifrom Mr. Morris to bin of the 2ist of June, 1797f, in "which Mr.. Morris says, c I am in ",pursuit of money for .31r. Carroll and expect success, "c but I hope, when it comes, he wil not plague himself ",and embarrass us by a refusal of it. He otight to "chave had his money, a~nd I have piways lamented that ",we could not pay it when due? but certainly we will " pay as soon as we can."
The answer then avers that Morris and Nicholson nver'paid the purchase money due to Mr. 'Carroll, nor in any other respect complied with the contract vith him, whereby they forfeited all right to the purchase of the.troperty therein mentioned, and disabled themselves from conveying to thd Defendant, Law, the property he had so selected. That one oC the. purposes of the deed of assignment under which the Complainants claim title, was to pay Mr. Carroll IS,000 dollars due upon that contract, whereby it became their duty to pay that sum so as to obtain titles.for the Defendant, Law ; but they never did pay that sum to Mr. Carroll, and it is not now in their power to comply specifically with the contract between the Defendant, Law, and Morris, Nicholson and Greenleaf.
To this answer-exceptions were also taken,-and the Complinants, Pratt and others, filed an amended bill, in which they contend that the Defendant, Law, had not made his selection ip due time and manner according to the origpial contract; that, therefore, the Complmnants might now satisfy the balance of the contractb., a conveyance of such lots as they should deem proper; au4 under that 'itea had tendered to Mr. Law a conveyance for the quantity pf,lail which be. had a right to cldim.

V. leaf had contracted to purchase from the comnissioners; LAW for that was the only contract which gave them a right of & CAMP- selection.
BELL.o
The Complainants also contended that, if, upon Mr. Law's failure to select his lots within the time limited, the right of selection did not revert to Morris, Nicholson and Greenleaf, yet he was bound to close his selection in a reasonable time, and before Morris and Nicholson had completed their selection under'the contract of Xforris and Greendeaf with the commissioners; and that, after closing their selection, they were not bound to convey to Mr. Law, any lots not selected by them, or not before that time selected by him and notified to them. They admit that although Mr. Law bad forfeited his right of. selection, yet Morris and Nicholson, being desirous of gratifying him, and of stimulatin.; him to make the stipulated improvements, caused to be conveyed to him, by deeds dated the 11th of March, 1796; and the 20th of JTuly, 1797, 1,935,008 square feet of land, without annexing thereto the condition of building which they had a right to insist upon, including thereini sundry lots, not within his right of selection, whereby lie obtained more valuable lots, and on better terms than he was entitled to under his contracts.
They aver that they are the bona jhlc purchasers, for a valuable consideration, of Morris, Nicholson and Greenleaf's equity of redemption in the mortgaged property, without notice of any agreements or transactions between them and the said Law, other than those which appear on the face of the bond of the 3d of December, 179-,, the agreement of the Ith of December, 1794, that of Mardh 10th, 1795, and the niortgage of the lth of September, 1795; and are not in equity bound by any other agreement; if any such exist.
They further state that the legal estate of the mortgaged premises, never was in Morris and Nicholson, or either of them, but was in Greenleaf alone. That after Greenleaf had sold to Morris and Nicholson his interest .n the Washington lots, being largely their creditor, lie caused all their propefty in the city to be attached by

'which on the following day wan attached at the suit of LAw the Defendant, Campbell, which attachment, in favor & c& rPof Greenleaf, was continued until and after the 26th of BELL. June, 1797, when Morris and Nicholson assigned and
tfansferred to the Complainants for a valuable consi4eration all the attached property ; whereupon Green-
leaf's attachment was dismissed by consent of the parties, inasmuch as the Complainants had, by the assignment, obtained all the benefit which they could have obtained by prosecuting the attachmentto judgment of
condemnation. They aver,,therefore, that if the Defendant, Campbell, had any equitable claim to the property by virtue of his attachment, the Complainants have a prior equitable claim by virtue of their prior attach-
ment.

But they aver also that neither Morris nor Nicholson ever had such an estate in the mortgaged premises as could be the subject of an attachment at law,, or as could
be condemned at law, wr as could be seize&and sold un-
der a fier! facia.s; and that the Defendant, Campbell, had iotice of the Complainant's legal and equitable title when-he purchased the property,

That if Morris and NIcholson had any equitable in-

terest therein, it was subject to the duty of dbing'jus-

tice to Greenleaf, the legal proprietor, by paying all

they owed him, before the trust as to tiem would be de-

creed to be performed; and if they had an equity of re-

demption in the mortgaged lots, alid if any thing was

seized, condemned ind sold, under the said Campbell's

attachment, it could be only the right which Morris and

Nicholson had to redeem the said lots, by conveying to

Mr. Law the balance of property due to himf and by

satisl ying all equitable claims which Greenleaf had up-

on them. And that if the Complainants should be com-

pelled to convey to Mr. Law the balance of property

Nicholson, purchased upon speculation at market, and

at a price far below tieir nominal value; and they contend that Campbell could not, in equity, recover, even if lie had a prior lien upon the lots, more than the. bona file actual value wvhich he gave for the notes, with legal interest thereon. They call upon him to state what consideration he gave fbi the notes; an(d at what price lie purchased in the mortgaged lots at the sale under tho f.,fit. issued upou thejudgmen. on his attachments.

The answer of the Defendant, Campbell, disclaims all benefit and title under or by virtue of the releases executed by the Defendant, Law, at his request; but claims to hold entirely under the'judgment of the Cojirt of appeals of Maryland upon his attachments ; and refers to his bill of interpleader, (as he terms it)and the transcript of the record of the Court of appeals of Maryland exhibited therewith; by which transcript it appears that the attachments were issued mi the 21st of .April,1797, by virtue of the act of assembly of Mary-

On the 22d of April, 1797, the sheriff levied these at- LAw

tachments on part of the property included in the mort- & CtAMPmage to Law, and particularly set forth in the sheriff's BELL. return.

On the return of these attachments, Morris and Niih.olson appeared by attorney, and upon argument, the
general Court quashed the sheriff's return; whereupon Campbell took a bill of exceptions which .stated thht the Plaintiff, Campbell, offered in evidence the (Ieed or
the l3th of May, 1796, from Greenleaf to Morris and Nicholson ; whiereby Greenleaf conveyed to them all his
property in the city of Washington, excepting 3 squares, and excepting all such squares, lots, lands, and tene-
"ments, as were either conveyed or sold, or agreed to "be conveyed either by'all or either of them, the said
"Morris, Nicholson and Greenleaf, or any of their "agents prior to the 10th of July, 1795." That Camp-
bell prayed condemnation of one moiety of certain squares, particularly described, as the property of Mor-
ris, and the other moiety as the property of Mr. Nicholson. That Morris and Nicholson offered in evidence the mortgage to Mr. Law of the 4th of September, 1795,
which included those squares; and that Campbell offered in evidence one of the releases of Mr. Law, dated the 5th of October, 1797, to Morris, Nicholson and
Greenleaf, which are mentioned in the bill of Pratt -and others -P.Law and Campbell, Morris and Nicholson then offered in evidence the deed of trust from Morris, Nicholgon and Greenleat ,o the Complainants, Pratt and others, of the 26th"of June, 1797, conveying to them all the right and interest of .M.rris, Nicholson and Greenleaf ifi the city of Washington ; and proved that the aforesaid deed of release from Mr. Law, to Morris
Nicholson and Greenleaf, waq lodged by Mr. Law alone, in the proper office to be recorded ; and that it was executed by Mr. Law with a knowledge' of fie aforesaid deed oftrust to the Complainants, against their will and express prohibition, and without the knowledge or assent of Morris, Nicholson and Greenleaf, or eithiel of them; whereupon the general Court of Maryland was

of opinion that neither Morris and Nicholson, ior either of them, had ",such an estate in those .squares, ,,whereof the rIlaintiff could have judgment of con,,demnation."
Upon this bill of exceptions the cause was carried to
the Court of Appeals of Maryland, who reversed the
judgment of the General Court " as to the land contained
" in the return of the sheriff of Prince George's Coun"-ty ;" and adjudged "$that the lands and tencmnents so , as aforesaid attached, that is to say;" (&c. describing them) c be condemned towards satisfying unto the said se William Campbell, as well the said sum of," &c. - and that the said W. Campbell have thereof execution,"
&c; - Wheretp)6n execution issued f'oih the Court ofAp- peals, returlable to the General Court." This execution was a secial-fieri faeias, which after reciting the ttachuit, the sheriff's return, thejudgmeot of the GeAvral Court, the Writ of error,' and the judgment of the Court of Apieals, commands the sheriff of Prince George's County, that of the lands and tenements attached, (describing the .quarcsj, &c.) he cause to be nade the damages and co~ts, &c.

Upon this execution the sheriff sold the attached prop. erty to W. Campbell the Plaintiff, for a comparatively small sum.
Under these proceedings the Defendant, Campbell, in his answer contends that, by the laws and constitution or Maryland, his title and interest in the said lots is con. elusive upon all the world, and that the judgment of the Court of Appeals of Maryland cannot be opened. ,He admits, howeve', that lie acquired by those proceedings, no more interest or title than M1oriis and Nicholson had in the property at the time or the attachment, and that Mr. Law's mortgage was a prior incumbrance ; but denies that there is any other lien or incumbrance thei'con. He contends that he has a right to redeem tile lots from that mortgage on any terms which should be agreed upon between him and Mr. Law. le affirms that the Complainants knew of his attachment when they took their deed of assignment of the property.

To this answer the Coin.. plainants excepted, because the Defendant. Campbell, did not answer that part of the bill to which he demurred.
The bill of Lazv against Prattand others, stated tie bond of Morris, Nicholson and Greenleaf of the 3d December, 1791, to convey to him 2,100,000 square feet of ground in the City of Washington ; the agreement of the 10th of March, 1795; and the mortgage of the 4th of September, 1,95. That he had received conveyances for 7.73,12i square feet on the i-4th of March, 1796 ; for 1,112,'J681 square feet on the 20th July 1.797 ; and for 128;223 square feet by a subsequent conveyance, the title of which last mentioued quantity was defective. That Morri- and Nicholson, having obtained all the right, title, and interest of a/lthe joint property ATM. N. & G. in the city of Washington, in the year 1797 became insolvent, and conveyed the same to the Defendants, Prattandothers. That neither bl. N. & G. nor the Defendait.q, i 'att and others, did procurefrom the Camissionersof the City of Washington, a good, clear, and sufficient title to the property, out of which ithe Complainant, Law, had the the right of selection ; so that although'ho made his selecfion, and requested a conveyance of the remaining 4.00,000 square feet, the Defendants refused to .convey the same, and are unable to comply with the en-

the Complainant, Law, had received good titles to L,9l5,l89& square feet in part compliance with tie condition of the bond ; and that the title to the 128,223 square feet was defective. They admit that M. N. & G. became insolvent and conveyed all their interest to these Defendants as trustees for certain creditors.
They do not'admit that either they, or M. N. & G. were ever bound to procure a'good title to all the propertylout of which the Complainant had a riglitto select; nor that he made his selection within the time limited by the contract of the loth of Mareh, 1.795 ; nor thal they, or.M. N. & G. ever refused to convey to him any jiroperty which he had a right to demand under those agreements.
They say that they have been inforined and beligive that the Complainant, Law, never made a deflnite and final selection of lots to satisfy the condition of the bond; but,' without authority or limitation of time, assumed the right of varying hi choice from time to time according as circumstafices indicated a prospect of increasing value, and did not confine himself to the property, nor to the terms contained in the contract of the l0th of March, 1795. They admit, however, that Morris and Nicholson, as a matter of indulgence, acquiesced in the selections thus made, as far as they had the ability to convey the lots so selected.
They contend that upon the Complainants having failed to make his seleetion within the limited time, the right to select reverted to M. N. & G. and that the Corn plainants, as their assignees, had a right to select and tender a conveyance for the balance remaining unconveyed ; and that they had done so, but the Complainant refused-to accept the same.
They contend also that the Complainant is not entitled to relief in equity, until lie !hall have complied with

They deny, iii general terms, that the mortgage is rorfeited or the condition thereof broken.

After replication to this answer, the Complainant, Law, filed an amended bill stating in substance the same matters which are contained in his answers to the bill of Pratt and others against him.

To this amended bill, the Defendants, Pratt and others, filed their answer referring to the proceedings in all the causes before mentioned, and praying that the whole may be considered as one cause. They aver that the building contract constituted a material part of the consideration in the sale of lots to the Complainant; that the assignment of that contract to the conln'ssioners of the city, by Morris and Nicholson, was not valid,. and did not exonerate the Complainant from his obligation in equity to perform it. They proceed to state %ith more minuteness the facts and transactions stated in their original and amended bills against Law and Campbell.

They deny that Morris and Ntciolsou could authorize the Complainant to make a new selection so as to embarrass the mortgaged property, or to disable themselves from complying with the term.; of the mortgang-e whereby subsequehit incumbrancers, whose rights accrued before such new selection, could be defeated.

Thewdeny also, that they are bound by any agreements between the Complainant and M. & X. of which they had not notice at the time of tile assignment to these Defendants.

The Complainant having in his amended bill stated that he had solicited to have the residue of what was duo to him conveyed out of half of square 743, square 699j, square 696, square 730, and the square north of 697, the Defendants in their answer deny his right to select either of those sjuares.. As to the square 743 which is the only one in which Morris and Greenleaf ever held any
definite interest, they aver that all their interest therein, consisting of one moiety thereof has been conveyed to him. That as to the square 696 and 730, the Complainant was express.y prohibited from selecting them by the contract of the 10th of March, 1795 ; and that neither of the squares 699, 730, 696, and north of 697 are mentioned in the Complainant's selection of December $th, 1795, nor in any former selection pretended to have been made by him ; that neither of those squares ever belofi6. ed to M. N. & G. or either of them, nor are included in the .6000 lots bought by Morris and Greenleaf of the Commissioners, or have been apportioned to them or either of them, or can of right be claimed by them, or either of them, under any contract.

To this answer there was a general replication.

The bill of Pratt and others, against Duncanson and Ward, was originally filed to obtaif an injunction to prevent Duncanson from selling certain quares which he had advertised for sale under a mortgage dated the 12th of Seiptember, 1795, given to him by Morris, Nicholson, and Gieenleaf to indemnify him'against the return of certain bills of exchange which he had drawn for their accommodation for 12,0001. sterling, 7,6001. sterling# of which had been taken up by the Defendant, Ward, with the funds of Greenleaf, and the residue by Greenleaf himself; ind to obtain a conveyance of those squares to the Complainants! who were the assignees of Morris, Nicholson andGreenleaf's equity of redemption. Those squares were all included in the prior mndrtgago to t ihouias Law.

After Duncanson and Ward had filed their aiswers. and testimony had been taken in the cause, by which it appeared that the facts stated in the bill were true, WILLII CA.kSIrELL filed a bill against all'the parties to the cause, viz : Prdtt and other's, assignees of Morris.

tor of Morris and Nicholson, 'caused attachments in his name, but for.the use of these Defendants, to be laid on the same property ; which attachments remained in full force (if the property was liable to ateachment for the debts of Morris and Nicholson) until and after their as-
si-nment of their interest therein to these Defendants, when -they, having by the assignment obtained all the benefit which they could have obtained by prosecuting the attachments to judgment of condemnation and sale, caised the attachments to be dismissed. And therefore that if Campbell could claim any title in equity under his attachiuents,' these Defendants have a prior claim in cqtuity by virtue of their prior attachments, and the assignment from Norris, Nicholson & Greenleaf. They deny that the legal title was ever in dorris and Nicholson, or either of them, but was in Greenleaf alone, until convey.ed to Thomas Law by the nortgage of the Ith of September, i795, in whom it remained until his releases of the 4th of Septembe'r, and 5th 'of October, 1797, which releases, if valid, enured to the benefit of these Defendants.

As to certain squares contained in the mortgage to Duncanson, viz..the square ca-it of 51-6, the square cast 6f 5-i,7, the squares 5!9 and 596, the sqtrare east of 596, and the square 597, they aver that long bieforo
Campbell's pretended attachment, viz. on the -10th of

They aver that the Complainant, had notice of all these facts at the time of his purchase at the sheriff's sale under his attachment.

They coutend also that if the Complainant could, by any process at law, attach the tquity of redemption, yet
lie can have no remedy in equity, unless he has o~re4l

That th y did'come back*protested; that Morris and Nicholson wholly failed to take up any part the o1r but the whole %as paid by Greenleaf with his own separate funds. and that Morris and Nicholson are still indebted to him -for two thirds of the amount of the U2,000 sterling, with interest, charges, damages and
costs of protest, and were also otherw;su largely indebted to him at the time of tle attachment. That upon taking up the bills, Greenleaf informed Duncanson -thereof and forbade him to release the mortgage, on his intimating a design so to do, and requested him to retairr the same as a security to him, (Greenleaf) for the two thirds of the amount of the said bills, which Duncanson agreed to do; and thereby became in equity a trustee of the mortgage for the benefit of Greenle-f; and this Defendant as his assignee claims a right to
stand on the same equitable ground as Duncanson would have stood upon if the bills had not been taken up, so far as respects two thirds of the amount of the. bills, with damages, &c.; and therefore to have a prior equity to that of the Complainant, if any lie has.

to.him about 2,000,000 of square feet; and that it was
pt'obable they would have conveyed the relnaining4100,000 square feet, also at the same time, ifMr. Law would ha%e taken them out of the squares contained in his first selection. No tenderhowever was madetohim of thebalauce out of those squares, and there was evidence that Mlor-
ris, Nicholson and Greenleaf, had acquiesced in Mr. Law's claim to have part of thib property which Green-
leaf had contracted to purchase of Mlr. Carroll, although neither Greeileaf nor Mforris and Grecnleaf,,over had any any right of selectiou in that property. There was also evidence that it was the universal practice of the commissioners, in selling lots, to charge each lot with its proportion of the alley laid out for the genexal bene-
fit of the lots in the squares; and that such practice
bad been uniVersally acquiesced in.

With regard to the opinion of the Court of Appeals of Maryland, 6pon the subject of Campbell's attachinent, there was evidence that the counsel for Morris and Nicholson had written a letter to judge Runivy, the ihiefjudge of the Court of Appeals of larylanud, requesting to know the extent and ground of the opinion
of the Court upon which the.ludgment was rendered
and received from him the following answer:

P.B. KByfor the .4ppellaWts,contended,

1. As to the first point, that nothing was condemned under those attachments, but the legal estate of Morris and Nicholson, if they had any.

An equitable estate is not liable to attachment or execution under the laws of Marylaid.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals of Maryland, jn this case, does not lurport to condemn tihe equity of redemption, nor to designate what interest in the land
Morris and Nicholson had.

It appears, by the letter from Judge Rumsey, the Chief Judge of that Court, that the majority of the Court was of opinion that the covenant in the mortgage to Mr. Law, that Morris, Nicholson and Greenleaf should quietly enjoy the land until default made, gave them a legal estate, ii the nature of an estate for years, which was liable to condemnation ; and that the Court
intended to condemn nothing r'ore than the le.gal estate, whatever it might be, which Morris and Nicholson had
in the land -at the time of the attachment. That it was the ego, and rot the"equitable estate, which they considered liable to condemnation, appears from the language of the judge, ,,But oi& this" says lie, (meaning, on the question whether an attachnent ought t0 be agaixst a mortgagor's interest) - tl.eJudes gave oopi,nion. Sufficient to them was it, that, in their opinion, "any interest was attachable, and upow- ejectinent, this , -wouldhave been.diso.sed." Now no interest could, in Maryland, have been maintained upon ejectmeut, but a

SUPREME COURT U. S.
PRATT legal estate; which sho'is that the Court of Appeals & oTHErS9 contemplated the condemnation of.a legal interest only.
-0. 'This is sufficient to show that the judgment "ofthe Court LA&w of Appeals is not conclusive evidence that the equity of &IbAMr- redemption of Morris and Nicholson was affected by the ELE. attachment.
By the construction which 'the Courts of Maryland have uniformly given to the British. Statute of 5 G. 2, making lands in the colonies liable for debts, nothing but the legal estate is liable to execution at law. The rule is the same in England, 2 .Lk. 292, Plunket v. 1enson. 3 .ttk. 200, Shirley v. Watts. 3 .4lk. 739, Burdcu ,. IKennedy. Thie act of assembly of Maryland, 179!, ch. 60, sec. 10, is'founded upon this known ant acknowledged rule of law. It recites that, " whereas it often " occurs that persons against whom judgments or decrees " are obtained, hold and possess,or claim lands,tenements, " or hereditaments, by equitable title only, and the bredi69 tor or creditors ofsuch persons are often without reme4c dy, either at law, or ii equity;" and then goes on, to give the chanellor power to decree a sale of the equitable title ; and togive the purchaser all the remedies which the person had whose equitible title is thus sold.
That act of Maryland in I810, (4. 60) which, for the first time subjected equitable 'estates to legal process, wvas passed ten'years after tle judgment of the Court of Appeals in"this case, and is strong, if not conclusive evidence, that such'estates were not b'efore that time liable to such process.
But if an equity of redemption be liable to attachment, yet the Complainant's equity is prior to that of Campbell, for they had a prior attachment, in the name of Greenleaf, against Morris and Nicholson,' which wa.s continued until they obtaified an assignment of that equity of redemption which was the object of their suit. If I attach the personal property of a man, and before coidemnation he sell it to. me in satisfaction of my clahi,"I am under no obligation to proceed with my suit tojttdg. ment. I have already obtained the fruit of my action. If he does voluntarily wbat the law would compel him to &QIi,t is sufficient.

-That conveyance was expressly made subject to this mortgage to Duncanson. All the rightq df Greenleaf, growing out of those exceptions, resTvations and con-

The bills secured by the mortgage to Duncanson were sol, and the proceeds quaily divided between Morris, Nicholson and Greenleaf, each of whom.agreed to take up -ne third of the-amouit thereof'if they should return protested. They returned protested, and Green-
leaf was obliged to take up the whole. Upon doing this, he requested Duncauson not to release the mortgage, but to retain it as his security. This Duncanson agreed to do; and thereby became a: trustee, in equity, of the mortgage for the benefit of Greenleaf.

Ten of these squares, mortgaged to Duncanson, had been conveyed by MoTis and Nit holson to Greenleaf, in June, 1796, subject to Law's and Duncanson's mort-
gage-Morris and Nicholson, therergre, at the time of the attachment, had no equity'of redem'ition in trose ten

F. S. Izy, for Campbell, relinquished the claim as to the ten squares, conveyed to Greenleaf, and the four squares assignedto Ashley.
As to Miller's claim to a lien in consequence of Green. leaf's payment of.the bills, he contended that no such lien was thereby created, or could be created, without an actual assignment of the mortgage. The condition of the nmortgage was. that Morris, Nicholsrn and Greenleaf, or one of them, should take up the bills. One of them did take up the. bills and thereby the mortgage was discharged. The lien no longer existed, and the property reverted to Morris and Nicholson.
As to the claim that Campbell should b6 compelled to take only what hggave for the notes, he contended that -the judgment of the Court of Appeals had ascertained the amount of this debt, and that the judgment could not now be opened.
As to the question whetheran equitable interest could be attached, he relied upon the judgment of the Court of Appeals as conclusive.

As to the prior attachment by Greenleaf, for the use of Pratt and other's, lie contended that it created no lien in as much as it was not prosecuted to.judgment. That the 4ttachment and the Qdeed of assignmen could not be connected together so as to preserve the inchoate lien which was commenced by the attachment.

FEBRUARY TERM 181.
Upon the great principles of justice, real property is as PnuA much liable for a man's debts, as personal. L.ses were & OTUEUS never extended in Ei ngland until' the statute of 1r 8. V. And the Courts always refused to extend trust until the rAyw statute of frauds authorized them so to do. Nor could & CAMPau equity of redefiiption -be affected at !loa.r=v1.
But this question hern turns wholly upon the local law of Maryland, and the construction of the statute-under which these attachments were issued. It is the act of 1795, eh. 56, which auth6rizes a justice of peace, &c. to issue his warrant to the clerk of the Court requiring him to issue an attachment - aainstthe lauls, tenements, goods, chattels and credits" of the debtor.
The single questinn is, whether these were the lands of Morris'and NUibholson at the time of the attachthent.
From the time of the colonization of Maryland, its jurisprudence has been divided between Courts of Law, and. Courtsof Chancery. If the statute speaks the langAiage of the Courts of Chancery, as well as of law, the case is clear. In Chancery, the mortgagor, and not thm mortgagee, is owner of the land. The equity ofredemption descends, to th. heir; the testator may devise it; his wife is entitled to dower; the husband is tenent by courtesy; in.short, the mortgagor is owner of the land, as'against all the world except the mortgagee. The legislature, by its acts, speaks to the "wltol jurisprudence of the state, not to one branch only.
A trust estate tvas*liable to executiop and attachment long before. Why should not an equity of redemption be equally liable? The act expressly makes credils, liable to attachment, which was as contrary to the course of the common law as to subiect equitable interests in land to condemnation.
Lord Mansfield, in a case in Douglass's reports (Doug. 610,_) says, it is an affront to common sense to say that the mortgagor is not the real owner. The equity of redemption is tho substantial ownership in the view of all the world.
The act of Maryland in ISO, applies to executions

SUPREME COURT U. S,

PRiTT only, and riot to attachments, upon equitable interests in

& OTHERS lands. The legislature supposed the case of 'attach-

v.

ineizts already provided for.

LAW

& CAAP- The act of1794, only shows thatthelegislature thought

3ELL. eanitablo interest in lands ought to bd as, much liable

for debt. as legil interests.

They alsp thought it expedient to give the purchaser of an equitable interest under the decree of the Court. all tlid remedies legal as well as eqluitable which the
debtor formerly had.

The case of Waters v,Stewvart, (i. Caine'sCases in Er. v'or, 47) is precisely analagous to this. The statute of
N w York, upon which that .case arose, subjected to execution, c iahds, tenements and real estate ;"' undep
which expressions, it was decided that an equity of redemption, of a mortgage in fee, was liable to be sold by.
virtue of aJlerifacias.

It is said however that the Court of Appeals in Maryland was of opinion that the covenant for quietenjoy. mqnt was equivalent to a lease for years, which is a lc-. -gal estate, and that they did not mean to condemn any thing more than that legal interest. But that covenant created no legal estate. No specific term was mentioned during which Morris and Nichblson should hold it. It was not an estate for years If "ny thiig was con-
dcmnedl by the judgment of the Court of Appeals, it must have been the equity of redemption ; for that was the only interest in Morrisand Nicholson at the time of the attachment. T",that .!eqlity of redemption, Campbell acquired a legalright.

But it is said that Campbell purchased the notes of
Ma'ris and Nicho1son at a discount, and ought to be permitted to enforce is lien only to the extent of his
purchase money and interest. There is no evidence of the fact; but if there wag, yet if h was guilty of no fraud, he became the creditor of Morris and Nicholson,
to the full amount of the notes , he was-pan gira with the other creditors, and he who got ilia first attachment was in the be3t situktion. Campbell obtained the first cifectivelien. That of Grecnlvrf was only incipiwnt.

purport to be a continuation of the lien; nor could it

transfer what Morris and Nicholson did not possess,

.Xdn dat qui non habet.

But it has been objected that the-judgment cannot be
executed by afieri facias, which is applicable only to legal estates in possession. But if'the condemnation of an equity of redemption is sanctioned by the act, the sale .of that equity under a fier facias is equally sanctioned. The one is a necessary consequence of the oth-
er. An execution is as natural to a decree in equity as to a judgment at law. In both cases the thing is to be taken to satisfy the debt.

This is no longer a mere equitable lien. It is a right of property, derived from the attachment, the judgment the execution, the sale, and the purcllase, which it may be necessary for a Court of equity to effectuate; but
the right is a legal right.

This was a proceeding in reem, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals of Marylai-:d, is cmclusive against all the world.

As to the rule cited from, .Maxims in.Equity,.p. 9, ahd found also in I Vern. 179, that " a stranger who buys
" in a prior incumbrant.e shall ho alliwed only what he "really paid, as against othr incumbrancers ;" its authority is doubtful. It is'questioned by two cases; pne in S/ kzcld, cited in the margin; and the other in 2 Alk. 51, MIullet -. Park. And the doctrine applies only to
ageqts, trastets, heirs. at law, or executors.

Campbell's indumbrance was a legal one. He had a atute title.

P. B. 'EY, zn meptj.

There cannot be a legal title to an equitablIe thing. It

general rule is that equitable rights.must be enforced by equitable means, and. legal rights by legal means.

The case in New York wasaecided upon the statute
of that state, and a long previous practice under the statute of 5 C. 2, c. 7.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals of Maryland;

does not-purport to decide- what sort of a title M orris

and Nicholson had in the property attached. It was sufficient for them that Morris and Nicholson were in possession. They considered that possession under a

covenant for quiet enjoyiment, as a legal estate; and that, gave judgment of condemnation in order that Campbell

ight make out his title in ejectanent. So says the Chief

Judge of that Court in his letter, and that opinion is

peefectly consistent with the tbrms of the judgment. No

inference can be drawn, from the judgment, that tile

Court was of opinion that an'equity of redemption was

subject to attachment; and tile judge afflirms' that on

that pointthe Court gove no opinion. The point ig

therefore entirely 6pen for discussion. No case has

been produced from Maryland in which an equity of re-

demption has been sold tinder afierifaeiasor altachrienf. The want of such a case is strong evidence Qf thme ,ml-

In order to present at distinct view of time numerous

FEBRUARY TERM -18I0.

Itis well known that at the founding of this city, the PI.Tm'

propfietors of the soil gratuituously relifiquished a pro- & oin-m a

portion of their property to commissioners appointed to v.

receive it.

A.W

& CAriTMorris, Nicholson and Greenleaf purchased city sLL..
lands to the amount of fifty millions of square feet, to which quantitj they were entitled on the 3d of Decem-

ber, 79. Of this quantity, 6,000 lots were purhased from the commissioners; 2260 lots of Daniel .Carroll, and the residue of other persons nutnecessary to be specified
in this case.

In the agreement with the commissioners they stipulate to chuse the lots by squares; to build twenty houses
per anum for seven years; and until the year 1796,
not to sell without the building stipulation.

In the agreement with Carroll, the divisim was to take place by lots ; not by seectimi, but alternakly in order; and a variety of builditig and other stipulations were entered-into, which not being complid. Yith. Carrol re-ehtered on his land, and the contract was finally
abandoned.

On the 3d of December, 1.79-1 Lw entered into a contract with M'frris, Nicholson and Grenleaf for the purchase of 2,400,000 square feet of city land al the rate of five pence, Pennsylvania currency, per foot, for
which Law paid them 1.50.000, and took their bona to convey him that quantity of tand, in the penalty of 1.100,000.

To securethis bond the mortgage was given which is the principal subject of these suits.

On the ±3th of May, 1796, Greenleaf conveyed all his estate and interest in the Washington lands to Morris and Nicholson, who on the 26th of June, 1797, executed an assignment of all their interest to these Complainants,

ings executed.between the parties appear fair, unimpeaclied and reconcilable, we shall wholly reject the consideration"of that subject, and dispose of the case upon the unequivocal i-leaning of the contracts of the parties, nd their various acts whici have relation to the exectttion of those contracts.

Bythe bond to make titles, dated Dec. 3, 79-b, Mor-
ris, Nicholson hnd Greenleaf, are simply bound to make titles to Law, for the specified quantity of land in the city of Washington, leaving the situation of it, and the mode of selection entirely undefined, and of course retaining it to themselves.

On the day following, the same parties entered into articles of agreement, having relation to objects which appear not to have entered into their contemplation
originally,, And which'ou the face of them, bear the appearahice of perfect reciprocity. An option is given to Law to decline his purchase ii eighteen months, and
Law stipulates that if lie should not then d6cline it, ho shall be bound to improve every third lot pursuant to the original contract of Morris and Greenleaf with the
commissioners, in a specified time

On the 1oth of March, 1795, Law purchases other
concessions. By relinquishinj his right of declining the purchase, lie is allowed the right of selecting the property to be conveyed to him "excepting water property, "and excepting such squares as are now appropriated, c, or.respecting which the said Morris, Nicholson and
"Greenleaf have made arrangements." A list of the
excepted squares is subjoined, numerically distinguished.

Morris, Nicholson and Greenleaf also stipulate to secure Law in the discharge of their contract by a mortgage of other lands in the city " which are now in their " possession, until they can give -ood and sulficient titles - to the said Law, of such property as he may select cc and of which the titles are not already vested in them.''

contract with thetommissioners.

It was evidently incumbent on Law to makehis seltc-. tionin ifinety days, or shew some adequate cause, to ex-
cuse him from the discharge of that part of his agreemont. The evidence that he did make. his selection in the prescribed time is contained in his amended answer,
drawn from him by express allegations in the bill, and an exception to his answer, in which he swears that his selection was made in due time, and that a copy of his se-
lection, thus madej, was, in due time, communicated to the other parties. This fact, therefore, being uncontradicted by any evidenee, and confirmed by the solicitude expressed by Law, in all his coriespondence, to obtain his titles, must be considered is established, and throws upon the opposite party an obligation to shew either, that-he complied with the selection so made, or some
sufficient reason why it w.is not complied with. For these purposes they contend that it was in part complied with, and that it was the fault of Law himself that it was not wholly complied with.

It appears that on the t4th of March, 1796, there were conveyed to LaWV, 792,939 square feet of ground and on the 20th of July, :.797, 1,155,857 squpwe feet.

In these conveyances Law acquiesce5j with two exceptions;

1. That i2S,223 square feet contained in squares t'27, 789, and 729 have since been recovered bf him by
due course of law:

2. That in the computation of square feet supposed to be conveyed to him, are included the superficies of the
alleys passing through those squares in which the entire
squares were not conveyed.

To understand this objection it is necessary to remark

that, in the division between the commissioners and the

proprietors, it frequently happened that several lois in

a sqtare were assigled to the proprietor. In the selec-

tions made by 1E rris and Nicholson, and in those made

& c, p- To the first exception, the assignces reply that Law

E L. was conusant of the defect of'title in the squares allud-

-

- ed to; that lie took them with his eyes open, and there-

fore cannot now claim indemnity.

But we do not subscribe to this opinion. There is no evidence, iii the casei that. lie did agree to take these
sqnares unt onere. The letter of the ist of September,
1799, proves n othiig of the kind. The condition of the
obligation is not complied with by a conveyance of a defectivetitle.

The obligation to convey a good and sufficient title witi a general warranty will carry with it the obligation to refund in case of eviction. Law's knowledge of
the incumbered state of the t*itl,,. is of .no consequence whilst the opposite party was under an obligation to make that title good and suflicivnt. The assignees are. in~this respect, in no better situation than the original
parties. Their rights and interests are altogether subordinate to those of Law. They take the property in every respect incumbered with the obligation to make good ,the contracts of Morris, Nicholson and Greenleaf
with him, not only on general principles, but by txpress exception in favor of existing liens and incumbrances.

With regard to the allowance for the superficies of the alleys, we remark, that if the alleys be comprized under the denomination of streets, the conveyance of the ground which- they cover would, be void, and unquestionably
will not amount to a gratification of the contract. But from the president's instructions of the 17th oF October, 1791, there is reason to think that they were rights of wiy appurtenant t6 the lots of each, square respectively. If this claim of-Law's extended to the alleys in those squares of which the whole was conveyed to him, theri would be, some ground for disputing it. But as it is
confined to those squares only in which the right could not bo merged, because some one ormore of the lots were
the property of another. we think the allowance ought to be made; f~r I.aw certainly has not acquired a titlo
in fee simple in those alleys.

1; His frequent varying of his selections.

B]lEL.

On this subject there is a great variety of evidence and many contradictory allegations. But upon the whole, it appears that atter acquiescing in a number of changes, the selections about the last of the year 1796, set-
tled down to 699, 696, and half of 743, and the deficiency, if any, to -be supplied out of squares 730, and north
of 697.

But Law's inclination to vary his selections furnishes no sufficient excuse; for a tender of a conveyance confor .:ably to any one of those selections would have been a performance.

On the 5th of December, 1796, it appears a deed was tendered and this is asserted to have bten a legal per-
formance of their part of the agreement. Law contends that it was not because it contained the building stipulation, a distinct; independeu, contract. and which ought not to have been made a part of this conveyance. This question appears at that time to have beerA submitted to counsel and decided in favor of Law. Whether correctly or not, it i&now too late to enquire; 'for it appears to have been acquiesced in, and conveyances executed for niearly the whole of the same land which was contained in the tendered deed. 'The conveyance tendered cannot,
even ir In unexceptionable form, be now considered as a performaTice for the balance unconveyed, since the land contained in it canstitutes a great part, of that for which
cfedit'is given upon the agreement ; and after receiving conveyances in a different form it is surely too late now to contend for .the sufficiency of those tendered.

3. It is contended that the selection of.squares 69S 699, and 743 was Aut sanctioned by the contract of Maroh, 1795, and therefore Morris and .Nicholsoi were
under no obligation to convey.

It appears that these squares were situated in Carroll's

land, and, in the division' between Carroll and the Carm. missioners, were assigned to the former. They thus became a part of that land out of wheh, ltorris and
Nicholson were tq be-entitled to have cobveyed to them' their 220 lots, and it is contended that Law's right of selection could not extend to these lots because they were to be assigned alternately ; whereas Law's right of
selection was to be made by sqilares out of those in which Morris and-Greenleaf, had the right of selection. It appears however, that Morris and Nicholson acquiesced in Law's right tO select, from Carroll's land, and in a letter of March 1Sth, i797, explicitly acknowledges it.

The solution Pf this apparent inconsisteny is to be found in an observation previously made on another point in this case. A selection by squares was in practice considered by these parties as complied with when made of all those lots contained in, any given square which were owned by the party bound to convey. There could then he no reason for excluding Law from enjoyin.g his right of selection from among the squares con-
tained in Carroll's land. The objection certainly come& too late at this day. In Morris's letter to Mr. Cranch,
of February 22dj 1796p is contained an express recognitioki of the correctness of that selection, or at least of his accepiance of it in lieu of one more correctly made.

This act with its attendant consequences must be con' sidered by this court as givin'g legitimacy to the selec-
tion though it had- becni otherwise inderensible. Had Law been then informed that this selection was not authorised by con'ract he would have been thrown on his right to amend his selection, at a time when lie might
have done it with little prejudice to his interest. Blut at this timn it is surely too late to retract hn assent given nearly twenty yeer.? ago.

With regard to the two other squares selected, as it was only provisional, to make up any deficienry that might exist after conveying the three positively selected ; until the throe absolutely chosen were conveyed, nothing final could be done with these.

The last of)Jection is founded-on Law's failure to com. ply with his building contract.

FEBRUARY TERM Ami5&
But to this we answer : Law was not restricted as to PnA, the specific lots on which the buildings were to be erect- & oTrunMa ed. This choice, therefore, extended over the whole, 10. aud the obligation was* not complete until the whole zLw land was conveyed to him. We are of opinion that the & cAa selection was sufficiently proved ; and that Morris, Brx Nicholson and Greenleaf were in default with regard to the deficiency of land. On them, therefore, must ffil the consequences, of a state of things produced by their own default.
But ihere are other reas.ons, furnishpd by the case, in support of this opinion.
Law had advanced very considerably in the discharge of his building contract. He asserts (and it is hardly possible to believe otherwise) that hW" was originally in, duced to enter into that stipulation in consideration of similar stipulations entered into by Morris, Nicholson, and Greenleaf with the Commissioners and Carroll, and urges their failure as his excuse in part for desisting from building. But be this as it may, it is impossible for the ingenuity of man to devise any expedient by which a mean of comparison can be resorted to that would enable this Court, or a Jury to ascertain the injury resulting from this cause, or the sum in damages by which it may be compensated. We therefore put the building contract entirely out of the case.
It then only remains to decide what remedy Law is entitled to.
It is contended in behalf- of Morris, Nicholson and Greenleaf that it should be by specific performance or by an issue quitntum danificatus; that, at-any rate, it should not b.e by a decree to refund the purchase money with interest, as the value of the residue was necessarily diminished by the grafification of so larg6 a proporotion of his right to select.
To obtain a specific performance is no object of Law's bill; it is incumbent on the opposite party therefore to shew some ground of right to force such a .decree upon him. But considering, as wo do, that Law is not in default, there can be no reason to decree a specific perfor-

mance when every thing shews hat it would be produc. tire of nothing but loss. Bpsides. a specific performance, such as would answer the ends of jutice belwcen these
parties, has now become impossible; Carroll's property is resumed ; a large proportion of the land, purchased of the Commissioners, sold under legal process, and thus the benefit of selection so diminished that if performance were to take place, it must take place stripped of this its
most valuable appendage; whilst the diminution of the value of property, and the change of circumstances, produced by a lapse of twenty years, would render it mockery to call any execution specific.

An issue quantum damnifleatts it is certainly compe-
tent to this Court to order in this case ; but it is not consistent with the equity-practice to order it in any case in which the court~can lay hold of a simple, equitable, ,and precise rule to ascertain the amount which it ought
to decree.

In this case, the failure on the part of Morris, Nichol-
son and Greenleaf, certainly was as early as December, -1796, at a time when there Is no reasot) to suppose that any diminution in the value of property had taken place.

And as to the argument that the value of the right of selection diininished in proportion tothe exercise of it; that each subsequent choice was of less value than the preceding, we think it i? a sufficient answer that Law
never appears to have enjoyed the full bepefit oft his rigfit of selection in consequence of the difficulties which appear at all times to have obstructed his getting titles from the Commissioners or others. And finally when his choice settled- down upon the squares 727 789 and 729, and on Carroll's snuares 696, 699, and half of IMS,
he was evicted from the three former, and never could get the titles to the three latter. Now these squares
nearly make up his deficiency and there is reason. to believe they are among the most valuable of his choice. At
anrrate they appear to have been the favorite objects ofhis choice. We are therefore of opinion that the rule of equity in this case is that adopted by the Court below ; to wit, refunding at tbhirate of-purchase according to the quailtity actually deficient; but that interest is to be calculated only from the time when the selections were finallly
nmde, which we fix at 1st of January, 1797.

With regard to the actual deficiency it is understood that* there -vill he no difficulty in .adjusting it as the measurement and calculations of Mr. King will be acqu-iesced in.
.'We must next determine in what manner the money to be decreed to Law, in pursuance of the foregoitig principles, is to be raised from the mortgaged premises; and this leads us to the connexion between the interett of Law, and those of Campbells and Duncanson.

Campbell was holder of the negotiable paper of Morris and Nicholson to a considerable amount.

Greenleaf had conveyed to Morris and Nicholson all his interest in the mortgaged premises, so that each of them was entitled to an undivided half part of the equity of redemption. Campbhll sued out an attachment against M,orrisand Nicholson severally, under the laws of MarV-
land, (as this part of the District was then under the jurisdiction of Maryland) and h',d it levied on qundry of these mortgaged squares, specifically designtitiu
thenj. by their numbers. An issue was made up, and at the trial before the Court to which the writ was returadle, the question wis distinctly made whether the equitabh, hcrest of the Defendants in these squares was the subject of atthebmcnt. That Court decided that they were not; and the Plaintiff appealed to the Court of Ap'peals to. have their judgment reversed.

On the hearing before the Court of Appeals the deci-
slon of that Court is reversed and the squares attached are specifically and numerically condemned to satisfy
the debt due to Campbell. And finally, process issues out of that Court, to the sheriff of the county, reciting the attachment and condemnation of these squareso describing them with equal precision, and commanding
the sheriff to make, from the said lands, the money ne-
cessary to satisfy the judgment. Under .his writ, the squares, syo-.mndemned, were sold ; Campbell becomes the purchaser; and Law, at the instance of Campbell, andL without the privity of the assignees, executes a release, to MOrris and Nicholson, which is put on record ; at the same time taking a bond of indemnity, from Campbell, against. all,consequences that might result
from this act.

SUPREME COURT.Ui S.

PRATT Much ability has been exhibited in argument on the
& oTHRs question whether an equitable interest in lands and ten-0. ements be the subject of attaclment unde' the laws of
zAw Maryland. But we are of opinion that we ire not now & cAMP- at liberty to enter into the consideration of that question.
n3.ir. The decision of the Court of Appeals is final and contlurive on this point. The question was fully brought be-
fore them ; and althoug4i it had not fixed the law, wotld
have fixed the fate of these lands beyond reversal.

Some doutt is entertained, by one member )f the Court, whether the laws of Maryland go farther than to authorise the condemnation of this interest to satisfy the judgment so a to leave'the Plaintiff still under the necessity of applying to an equitable tribunal to effect a sale. .
But the majority ard of opinion thattho attachment-act, in making this interest tangible, makes it subject to the ordinary process of the Law-Courts, aild that in vesling. in the courts in %hich the condemnation takes place, the power to issue execution as in case of other judgmentsv it has'left it with those Courts so to fashion its process as to meet the exigency of each case. In thi.4j case, the very special nature of the execution shews that it las been fashioned with -great care and Itarning. We therefoe hold the sale, under this execution, to be valid.
Some conclusions were attehpted to be drawn, in fit-vor of the assignees, from the inadequacy of the price at which the"-property sold, and from the following state of facts : Greenleaf had issued an attachment, to the use of the assignees, against this property of Morris and Nicholson, a day prior to, that of Campbell. Subsequent to that of Campb'ell, MJorris and Nicholson asassign all their interest in this property to these assignees. Greenleaf's attachment was never prosecuted to judgment.
.It is contended that this union between the prior lien and.the interest attached, defeats the immc'diate lien.
But.we Wnnot admit this conclusion.

FEBRUARY TERM iSis

49Y

Levying an attachment has the double effect of creat- MAT lg a lien and instituting an action. But the lien is on- & o, ty inchoate ; it awaits thejudgment of the Court for its consummation, and must fall with the suit. To decide yAM otherwise would be to pernit the Defendant, by colu- & CA3Wsion,'or his own act, to nullify the lien ofthe subsequent BEL. Attachment.

As to the inadquacy of price, the evidence is full to show that it was produced altogether by the steps takes by the agents of tle assignees to embarrass or prevent the sale, and by thesupposed weight of the incumbrances resting upon the land. In this respect, therefore, tlere is no imputation to be cast upon Campbell.

'With regard to the release, it is very evident that, as it was never accepted by tile assignees, it ought in no wise to operate to their prejudice; nor ought Campbell to derive any benefit from it, as it was gratuitously proposed by him under an arrangement with Law. Give efficacy to this release, and consider how it will operate. Campbell purchases at a reduced price, subject to aa incumbrance ; but give effect to this release and he holds an absolute fee absolved from all'incumbrance.

Again, the property, mortgaged to Law, is liable for the whole amount to be raised for his indemnity ; but give efficacy to this 'release, and whilst Campbell acquires an unincumberd estate, on the one hand ; on the other, the residue of the mortgaged property, (that of which the assignees have not been deprived by sale of the sheriff,) must be sacrificed to raise the money due to Law. From this it will follow, either that a rateable abatement should be made, by Lav, proportionate to the squares by him released to Campbell, or that those squares should contribute their due proportion towards paying Law.

Before we proceed to apply these principles to the fi. nal disposal of the case, H is necessary to shew in what manner the interests of Duncanson and Ward become involved with those of these other parties.

aigainst the return of these bills. They were eighteen of the squares previously mortgaged to Law.

Of these bills about 7,6001. were returned under protest as the property of Ward ; and that sum, together with the damages, was paid, on the 26th of D ember, 1796, to Ward by Greenleaf. No satisfaction was entered on the mortgage, nor any assignment demanded until a day long subsequent. The residue of the bills were also returned and paid by Greenleat.
Thus circumstanced, whilst the mortgage appeared on record in full life, when in fact defunct, as the purpose, for which it was created, had been answered, the attachment of Campbell was levied on thirteen of these squares, and they were finally condemned, sold, and purchased by him. After the sale, notice was given to Duncanson, not to release, and that'an assignment to Miller, the as. signee of Greenleaf, would be demanded of hiim. The demand of GI'ecleaf, on Morris and Nicholson, arising from taking tip these bills, was contained ihi his assignment to Miller; and this payment is amoig the items making up the debit side of the account stated between Greenleaf and Morris and Nicholson.
Miller, the assignee, contends that he is entitled to such an assignment from Duncanson, and therefore to be considered in this Court as entitled to all the advantages which he would have derived from such an assignment if actually made.
On the one hand, Campbell had, at the sale, all the benefit of this sum as an existing incumbrance upon the land. It was, in fact, so much credited on the purchase money for which it sold ; but on the other, it is contended that it was a fraud upon the Public to keep up the appearance of an existing mortgaix on this property when it was in fact satisfied; that the agents of the assignees alone knew this fact, and good fiith demanded ofthem that they should have avowed it.

FEBRUARY TERM 18I.

699

We, are of opinion that the answer to this argument
is complete. The assignees did not conceive it to be a satisfied mortgage; they then supposed, and now con.
tend, that an equitable interest in the security, given for the payment of the bills, resulted to Greenleaf for two thirds of the sum paid by him on the bills and passed to them on the assignment. This reply, whether correct in point of law or not, certainly removes all imputation of fraud. But if it did not, what reason can be assigned why Campbell should take to himself a benefit from it? Had it been productive, in any mode, of injury or loss to him, it might have been urged -withsome plausibility;
but there is no reason to suppose. that any such effect has resulted from it. It could only operate to reduce the sales of the squares; and in this respect all the effects
produced by it resulted to his benefit altogether.

PRATT

_____.

One thing is indisputable; that i*f this mortgage be decreed satisfied, Campbell has acquired an interest
which he never purchased, and acquired that interest in property which ought otherwise to belong to the assign-
ees. It might perhaps be made a question whether the whole amount, apparently secured by the mortgage ought not to be made the measure of compensation to the assignees ; for to that amount it may reasonably be supposed the price of the property was reduced at the sale; to that amount were they damnified, and to that amount the purchaser was benefited. But it would not be consistent with the nature of these purchases to apply that rule to them with strictness. The uncertainty under
which a purchase is made, when made subject to an unliquidated incumbrance, gives such a purchase somewhat the nature of a speculation which the purchaser ought, to a reasonable extent, to have the benefit of, if
itprove lucrative. It is, therefore, only on the ground of an equitable existing lien upon the mortgaged premises, or equitable claim upoii Campbell, that the Court can decree in favour of the assignees. And as Campbell has filed his bill of interpleader, in the nature of a hill to redeem, we think the Court at liberty, when dezreeing in his favour, to impose on him such equitable terms as the nature of the case suggests.

The foregoing reas.nning proves that Campbell ought in cgnsc~ence, to make compensation to the niortga-

SUPREME COURT U. S.

V. did not purchase it, and therefore, although strict right LAW may secure to him the whole, he ought to be charged & CAMP- with a sum *in compensation for the interest so acquired BELL. above what was proposed to be sold.
Again, had these bills not been taken up, and the holder prosecuted all the drawers and indorsers to iusolvency, there can be no doubt* that the holder would have been ehtitled, to charge the mortgaged premises, in equity, with the payment of the bills. But what difference is there, in equity, between the case of any other holder ef these bills, and that of Greenleaf, who, when liable., equitably, only for one third, was compelled to take up the whole, 'and did it with his own funds ? It consists. only in this ; that the one becomes creditor for the whole; the other only for two thirds.
Upon the whole, we are of opinion that tie thirteen squares purchased by Campbell should be rateably charged with the payment of the debt resulting, under these transactions, from*Morris an'd Nicholson to Greenleaf.
