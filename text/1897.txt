LEVIS v. KENGLA.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

MR. JUSTICE GRA&Y delivered the opinion of the court.
This was a bill in equity, filed by the mortgagor of land in the District of Columbia, more than fifteen years after the sale and conveyance of the land under a power in the mortgage, to redeem the land and to enforce a trust therein.
The Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, after a hearing upon pleadings and proofs, dismissed the bill; and its decree was affirmed by the Court of Appeals. 8 App. D. C. 230. The plaintiff appealed to this court.
The following facts were either admitted or clearly proved: Philip Levis, being the owner of the land, on October 29, 1875, made a first mortgage thereof to trustees to secure the payment of his note to one Clokey for $2000, payable in three years with interest at the annual rate of ten per cent; and on May 13, 1876, made a second mortgage to one Weaver, as trustee, to secure the payment of a promissory note to Charles R. Kengla and George M. Kengla for $300, payable in one year, with like interest. Under this second mortgage, default having been made in the payment of the $300 note, the land was advertised for sale "subject to a prior trust of $2000;" and on October 29, 1877, was accordingly sold by auction, and was bought by the two Kenglas for the sum of $1000,

LEVIS v. KENGLA.
Opinion of the Court.
subject to the first mortgage for $2000. The plaintiff remained in possession of the land for about a year after the sale, and then removed upon notice from the Kenglas to quit, and they have ever since remained in possession. On January 17, 1878, Weaver, as trustee under the second mortgage, conveyed the land to the Kenglas, in accordance with the terms of the sale, and received from them the price of $1000. On May 26, 1879, the Kenglas, with the knowledge of Levis, sold and conveyed part of the land to one Htume for the sum of $2756.89. Levis never claimed any interest in the land, after the conveyance to the Kenglas on January 11, 1878, until he filed the original bill in this case against them on March 29, 1893.
In the bill, the plaintiff alleged that, when the land was put up for sale by auction on October 29, 1877, there being present no bidders nor any.persons interested in the purchase of the property except the defendants, the threatened sale was objected to by the plaintiff, and was only permitted to be made, without protest, upon an oral statement by the defendants that they only desired to obtain out of the property the amount of the incumbrances thereon, and that, if he would permit them to go through the form of a sale, they would take and hold the property for his benefit, and would reconvey it to him, or so much thereof as was left after sufficient had been sold to satisfy their claim, together with the costs of the sale; whereupon, relying upon their promise, he suffered an informal sale of the property to be made to them by the trustee.
The defendants, answering under oath, denied that, at any time before the sale to them, there was any understanding, agreement or suggestion, of any kind whatsoever, between them and the plaintiff, to impeach or qualify the absolute purchase of the property by them for their own use and benefit; and alleged that, after that sale, the plaintiff informed them that he believed he could obtain a purchaser for the property at a greater price; that, wishing the plaintiff to obtain as much as possible out of the property, they informed him that if he could obtain such purchaser within two weeks

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.
from the day of sale, they would convey the property to such purchaser, and turn over to the plaintiff the increased price obtained; that the plaintiff endeavored to obtain such purchaser, but finally came to them and informed them that he had failed to find a purchaser; whereupon they obtained a deed from the trustee.
Upon a careful consideration of the conflicting testimony introduced at the hearing, this court fully concurs in one of the positions taken by the Court of Appeals, and-stated in its opinion as follows: "The complainant has not established his case by any such preponderance of testimony as is required by the rules of law to overthrow the title of the defendants. On the contrary, the preponderance of testimony is wholly against him. It is unreasonable to suppose that the defendants, having a good security as it stood, would have converted themselves into permanent trustees for an indefinite period for the sole and exclusive benefit of the complainant, the latter never at any time concerning himself with the payment of interest or taxes, or the care of the property in any way, for fifteen years. To establish such an arrangement as this, very positive and satisfactory evidence would be required; and without going into any examination of the testimony, it is sufficient for us here to say that, in our opinion, the testimony wholly fails to establish any such arrangement, or any arrangement whatever upon which a court of equity would be justified in acting. It would seem to be a conclusive answer to the complainant's pretensions, that when, within a year after the sale, and when they deemed their indulgence to him to have reached its legitimate limit, they gave him notice to quit the premises, and thereby plainly intimated to him that they regarded any interest which he might have had in the premises as at an end, he submitted to the notice, without protest, and acquiesced in his exclusion from the property. This conduct, coupled with his utter disregard thereafter of any liability, either in regard to the property or in regard to the indebtedness, is wholly inconsistent with the existence of any such trust arrangement as that which he claims to have been made between him and the defendants." 8 App. D. 0. 237.

Statement of the Case.

This view being decisive of the case, it becomes unnecessary

to consider the defence of laches, or that of the statute of

frauds; and a discussion of the testimony in detail could be

of no value as a precedent, and would serve no useful pur-

WETZEL v. MINTESOTA RAILWAY TRANSFER COMPANY.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT.
No. 94. Argued January 25, 1898. -Decided February 21, 1898.
The decree of the Circuit Court, affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, dismissing the bill in this case on the ground of laches was correct, and that decree is affirmed.
THIS was a bill in equity filed in the United States Circuit Court for the District of Minfiesota, by the widow (since remarried) and heirs at law of George W. Remsen against the, Minnesota Railway Transfer Company, and over two hundred other defendants, to establish title to one hundred and- sixty acres of land situate within the corporate limits of the city of St. Paul, which the complainants contended was held in trust for them by the defendants. The land was estimated to be of the value of over one million dollars.
The facts of the case are substantially as follows: George W. Remsen was a private in Company K, Third Regiment, United States Infantry, and served in the Mexican war. By virtue of his enlistment as a soldier he became entitled, under section 9 of the act of Congress of February 11, 18417, c. 8, 9 Stat. 123, to locate a quarter section of government land, subject to private entry, under the regulations and restrictions established by the Commissioner of the General Land Office. This section further provided that in case of the death of

PEREA v. HARRISON.
APPEALS FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF THE TERRITORY OF FEW MEXICO.
No. 118, 497. Argued November 10, 11, 1891. -Decided November 29,1891.
When the defendant's answer in a chancery suit sets up matters which are impertinent, and he also files a cross bill making allegations of the same nature, a demurrer to the cross bill on that ground should be sustained.
The findings of fact in an appeal from the Supreme Court of a Territory are conclusive upon this court, whose jurisdiction on such appeal, apart from exceptions duly taken to rulings on the admission or rejection of evidence, is limited-to deterihining whether the findings of fact support the judgment.
It being found that the defendant converted the entire assets which are the subject of this controversy, there vas no error in charging him 'with interest on the amount so converted, without regard to whether he did or did not make profits.
The solicitor was properly allowed a fee from the fund. An item in the decree below which was not appealed from by the complain-
ant is not before this court for consideration. A clerical error in the decree of the court below caused by the omission
of the name of one of the distributees, can be corrected, on application, by the court below after the case is sent down. The costs in this court must be paid by Harrison personally.
THE bill in the first above entitled suit was filed in a District Court of the Territory of New Mexico, in chancery, by Pedro Perea, as sole surviving administrator of the estate of Jos6 L. Perea, Second, deceased, and as one of his heirs-at-law, against the defendant, George W. Harrisoi, individually and as administrator of' the estate of his wife, Guadalupe Perea de Harrison, and also against the other heirs-at-law of Jos6 L. Perea, Second. It was brought to compel an accounting by the defendant George W. Harrison, individually and as administrator of the estate of his wife, for the property and assets of the estate of Jos6 L. Perea, Second, which had come into his hands.
The bill in substance alleged the following facts: Jos6

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Statement of the Case.
Perea, Second, a resident of New Mexico, died in that Territory on the 27th of August, 1887, being about the age of eight years. He left him surviving his mother, Guadalupe Perea, who was then a widow, and. his half brothers and sisters as his heirs-at-laW. On the 23d of July, 1884, his mother had been appointed his guardian and had taken possession of his property. In September, 1885, she married the defendant George W. Harrison. She continued guardian of her son up to his death, in August, 1887. In September, 1887, the complainant was appointed administrator and the mother was appointed administratrix of the estate of the minor. They both gave bonds and took the requisite oaths. On the 6th of March, 1888, the mother made what she termed a final report of her guardianship to the probate court, which showed a balance of over seventeen thousand dollars in her hands belonging to the estate of the minor. Under the influence of her husband she claimed, from the time of her son's death down to her own decease, to hold the property as guardian and not as administratrix, and while acting under that influence she refused to permit the complainant, after his appointment as administrator, to assist in the administration of the estate, or to have possession or control over any of its assets. Objections were made by the complainant to the report filed by the mother in March, 1888, called the guardian's final account, and these objections were sustained by the probate court. An appeal from that order was taken by the mother, but no further proceedings were had therein, and the same was practically abandoned. The mother died October 20; 1889. Her husband then unlawfully took possession of the property of the minor in her hands at the time of her death, and subsequently and on the 6th of January, 1890, he took out letters of administration on her estate, she dying intestate. He then claimed to hold the estate of the minor by reason of being administrator of his wife's estate. He took possession of the minor's estate individually, with full knowledge of its trust character, placed it to his own credit in bank, mingled it with his own funds, and claimed the right to retain possession and control thereof, and refused the demand to pay over the estate to him, which

HARRISON v. PEREA.
Statement of the Case.
the complainant made in his capacity as sole surviving administrator of the estate of the minor. It was also alleged that the mother of the deceased minor, acting under the influence and by the direction of her husband, and the defendant Harrison himself, individually, did by their actions cause great damage to the estate of the minor, and relief was demanded against the defendant Harrison as administrator of his wife's estate, and individually for an accounting in relation to the estate of the minor, of which he was in possession, and for a recovery of the amount found to be in his possession.
The defendant Harrison demurred to the bill, his demurrer was overruled, and he then answered both individually and as administrator of the estate of his deceased wife. In that answer the defendant denied many of the material allegations contained in the bill. He alleged that he and the defendant Grover William Harrison, who was minor child of himself and his deceased wife, Guadalupe Perea de Harrison, had succeeded to alr the interest and rights of his said wife in and to the property of the estate of Jos6 L. Perea, Second, and for that reason the complainant was not entitled to a decree for anything upon the accounting. The answer also alleged that the complainant was a son and also one of three administrators of the estate of the late Jos6 L. Perea, Senior, (two of complainant's brothers being the -other administrators,) and that those administrators had failed to account for a large sum of money which was due from the estate of Joss L. Perea, the .elder, to Jos6 L. Perea, Second, in his lifetime, and afterwards to his estate; and it was alleged that large amounts of property had come into the hands of such administrators of the estate of the deceased father, Jos6 L. Perea, Senior, of which no account had been made, and that the _ro rata share of the minor, JosA L. Perea, Second, in these assets so unaccounted for would amoufnt to thirty thousand dollars.
The complainant excepted to so much of the answer as contained the above allegations relating to the estate of the elder Perea and the action of the administrators with regard thereto, upon the ground of impertinence.
The defendant, by leave of court, also filed a cross bill, in

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Statemdnt of the Case.
which in very great detail he set forth the condition of the estate of the elder Perea and the action of the administrators thereof. Among other things it was alleged that the elder Perea in 1842 married his first wife and they.lived together until 1877, when she died; that he had by her six daughters and six sons, and that he brought into the marriage community a large amount of property, real and personal, amounting to a hundred thousand dollars, acquired by him by inheritance, bequest arid other means, and in addition personal property of the value of'about three hundred thousand dollars, and that at the time of his marriage his wife owned in her own right and brought into the marriage community real property situate in the Territory of New Mexico of the value of thirty thousand dollars and personal property of the value of thirty thousand dollars; that this property of the husband and wife became upon their marriage property of the marriage community, and so continued to remain the property of the -parties, to which large accretions and additions were made by the industry and labor of the husband and wife, so that at the time of the death of the wife in 1877 the full value of the united property was three hundred thousand dollars of realty and five hundred thousand dollars of personalty, and that all of this property, except the amount brought into the marriage community, was gain and increase of that property and belonged in equal parts to the husband and wife.
It was further alleged that in 1883 the elder Perea died, and that his estate had not'been properly administered'; that property belonging to the estate had not been inventoried as such; that the conduct of the administrators had been wasteful, the estate had not been properly taken care of, and that the administrators had expended large amounts -6fthe community property in the purchase of real property, so that such property had been unlawfully converted into worthless real property. It was also alleged that a pretended settlement had been made before the probate judge in New Mexico, and the administrators had made an accounting before the court, and had obtained their discharge and t'he cancellation of their bonds by that court; that this settlement before and discharge

Statement of the Case.
by the probate court was a fraudulent. one and fraudulently obtained, and that the decree should be set aside. It was also alleged that the defendant Harrison and his wife had before her death commenced a suit against the complainant and the other defendants who were administrators of the estate of the elder Perea,. asking for an accounting in regard to the identical matters and things set up in this cross bill; and that such suit was still pending and undetermined at the time of the commencement of this suit by the complainant herein.
Various other matters in relation to the management of the estate of the elder Perea were set forth in th6 cross bill at very great length, and relief was demanded .in accordande with what was alleged to be his rights by such complainant. This relief was of .all varieties, including ani investigation into accounts and matters relating to community property arising out of the marriage of the elder Perea in 1842, and an inquiry as to what was such property and its proper increase; also injunctions, accountings, decrees for conveyance, for distribution, for removal of the administrators; for the annulling of the pretended and fraudulent decree discharging the administrators and finally settling their accounts, and for-the appointment of a receiver of the estate of the elder Perea.
To this cross bill the complainant herein demurred upon several grounds, the substance" being that it was multifarious in that it was brought in regard to matters having no connection with the subject-matter of the original bill, and not. proper to be investigated in this suit.
The exceptions to the answer and the demurrer to the cross bill were argued at the same time, and, after hearing counsel, the court allowed the exceptions and struck out the matter excepted to, and it also sustained comnplainant's demurrer to the cross bill.
The case then being at issue was duly referred to a master, before whom both parties appeared and introduced their proofs, after which the master made his report. Upon that report and the evidence taken before the master, the case was brought to a hearing, and the court found in substance that the allegations set forth in complainant's bill were true. The

court also found that Jos6 L. Perea, Senior, died about the 21st day of April, 1883, and left his widow, Guadalupe Perea, (who afterwards married the defendant George W. Harrison,) and the other defendants in this suit, with the exception of George W. and Grover William Harrison, his heirs-at-law. Jos6 Perea, Second, was the son of the elder Perea by his second wife, Guadalupe Perea. After the death of the elder Perea, his widow married, as heretofore stated, the defendant George W. Harrison, and by him she had issue, Grover William Harrison, one of the defendants herein. With these exceptions all of the defendants were children of the elder Perea by a former wife. Pedro, Mariano and Jesus M. Perea were appointed administrators of the estate of their deceased father.
The court also found that the defendant George W. Harrison, not only upon the death of his wife had control, but that immediately after their marriage he took control and charge of the assets of the deceased ninor, and at the time of the entry of the decree herein he still retained and had possession of all the moneys belonging to that estate, and that they were subject to his individual control.
At the time of the death of the minor he owed no debts and there were no charges against his estate except his funeral expenses and the expenses of his last illness an& certain claims for his maintenance by his guardian. The defendant George W. Harrison, in the name of his wife-and in her lifetime, made sundry reports to the probate court as to the condition of the estate, some of which contained false entries to her advantage, and together they obstructed the distribution of the estate among the heirs.
The court also found that George W. Harrison, the defendant, wilfully obstructed the distribution of the assets of the estate of the minor, and by his misconduct rendered it necessary that the complainant should obtain possession of the assets by the institution of this suit, and that the necessity for this suit arose entirely out of the wrongful conduct of the defendant Harrison.
The amount found due from the defendant to the com-

HARISON v. PEREA.
Statement of the Case.
plainant was stated in the decree to be, with interest up to the date of the entry of the decree, June 19, 1893, the sum of $31,545.32, of which the defendant Harrison was entitled as administrator of the estate of his late wife, Guadalupe Perea de Harrison, to thirteen twenty-sixths, and to three twentysixths in addition by reason of the purchase of the interests of some of the heirs of the estate of Jos6 L. Perea, Second, and to one twenty-sixth more, as guardian of Grover William Harrison, one of the defendants, being a total of seventeen twenty-sixths; and the other heirs were each decreed entitled to one twenty-sixth of such balance; and it was provided in the decree that the defendant Harrison might, instead of turning over to the complainant, the administrator of Jos6 Perea, Second, the full sum found due, retain the amount found due him from the estate, which was stated to be the sum of $16,227.19. The defendant George W. Harrison was also charged with the payment of the costs of the suit individually, including the sum of one thousand dollars allowed the special master.
From the final decree thus entered the defendant George W. Harrison appealed to the Supremb Court of the Territory of New Mexico, which court, with some modifications, affirmed the judgment of the court below. Those modifications consisted in charging interest upbn the full amount of the sum found due by the decree of the court below, from the time of the entry of that d*ecree up to the 26th of August, 1895, which amounted to the sum of $4321.45, and the defendant was charged in the decree 6f the last named -date -with the full sum of $35,869.77. The fee for the solicitor of complainant was reduced from $5000 to $3586.97, being ten per cent upon'the amount found in the hands of the defe-dant Harrison. The complainant, as administrator, was decreed to be entitled to the statutory commission upon the last named sum found by the court to be due from the defendant Harrison, which commission amounted to $1943.48. The court also reduced the compensation of the special master from $1000 to $500. The court also 'modified the decree against Harrison for the payment of costs individually, by directing "that the

said solicitor's fee, the said commission for said administrator, the said special master's fee, and all of the costs of this case in this court and in the court below, should be paid out of said fund, and that of the remainder the said defendant George W. Harrison may retain in his possession seventeen twenty-six.th parts thereof, and that he shall pay over to said Pedro Perea, as administrator of Jos6 L. Perea, deceased, the remaining nine twenty-sixths, to be distributed to the heirs at law of said Jos6 Leandro Perea5 Second," as directed by the court. From the judgment of affirmance as modified the defendant George W. Harrison has appealed to this court. The complainant also took a cross appeal from the judgment.

MnR. JusTicE P bKEHAM, after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the court.
The question first arising in this case is in regard to the correctness of the decisions of the courts below in allowiig complainant's exceptions to portions of the answer of the defendant Harrison and in sustaining the demurrer to defendant's cross bill. The decision of the two matters rests in this case upon essentially the same foundation. If the allegations of the defendant's answer to the original bill are impertinent, it would follow that in this .case the cross bill would be multifarious, and that the demurrer on that ground should be sustained. The allegations in the two pleadings are of the same nature, only in the cross bill they are very greatly extended and set forth in almost infinite detail.
Impertinence is described by Lord Chief Baron Gilbert to be: "Where the records of the court are stuffed with long recitals, or with long digressions of matter of fact, which are altogether unnecessary and totally immaterial to the matter in question." 1 DanielPs Chancery P1. & Pr., (5th Am. ed.) marginal paging, 349. It is also said that impertinence is the introduction of any matters in a bill, answer or other pleading

Opinion of the Court.

in the suit which are not properly before the court for decision at any particular stage of the suit. Wood v. Mann, 1 -Sumner,. 578. "The best test to ascertain whether'matter be impertinent is to try whether the subject of the allegation be put in issue in the matter in dispute between the parties." All matter not material to the suit is regarded as impertinent. Woods v. .MorreZl, 1 Johns. Ch. 103; .1 Daniell, s8ura, 349, note.
As to multifariousness, it was said in Shields v. Thomas, 18 How. 253, 259: "There is, perhaps, no rule established for the conducting of equity pleadings, with reference to which (whilst as a rule it is universally admitted) there has existed less of certainty and uniformity in application, than has attended this relating to multifariousness. This effect, flowing, perhaps inevitably, from the variety of modes and degrees of right and interest entering into the transactions of life, seems to have led to a conclusion rendering the rule almost as much an exception as a rule, and that conclusion is, that each case must be determined by its peculiar features. Thus Daniell, in his work on Chancery Practice, vol. 1, p. 384, quoting from
Lord Cottenham, says: IIt is impossible, upon the authorities, to lay down any rule or abstract proposition, as to what con-
stitutes multifariousness, which can be made universally applicable. The cases upon the subject are extremely various, and the court, in deciding upon them, seems to have considered what was convenient in particular cases, rather than to have attempted to lay down an absolute rule." Continuing his opinion, the learned justice in the above case said: "Justice Story, in his compilation upon equity pleading, defines multifariousness in a bill to mean ' the improperly joining in one bill distinct and independent matters, and thereby confounding them.' . . Justice Story closes his review of the authorities upon this defect in a bill with the following remark: 'The conclusion to which a close survey of the authorities will conduct us, seems to be, that there is not any positive inflexible rule as to what, in the sense of a court of equity, constitutes multifariousness, which is fatal to a suit on demurrer.'"
Upon consideration of the various cases, we think that in.

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.
allowing the exceptions to the answer and in sustaining the demurrer to the cross bill, the courts below committed no error. The facts which the defendant Harrison endeavored to set up in his answer and cross bill were not relevant to the matters properly in issue in this suit. 'Neither the convenience of the parties nor their rights in regard to the matters set forth in the original bill would be aided by entering upon an inquiry relating to the matters set up in the answier and cross bill. It is clear that an investigation and accounting, such as is asked for in the cross bill, would take a long time, probably many years, to finish, involving as it would an inquiry into the amount of the community property of the elder Perea and his wife in 1842, and what should be found to be the actual increase springing from the same; also an inquiry into the transactions of the administrators of the estate of the elder Perea and into their liability on account of the -same, together with the taking of evidence upon the subject of the fraudulent chaiacter of the decree of the probate court discharging the administrators of that estate. It would in addition include an inquiry into the question whether the administrators, if the decree were set aside, had been guilty of such conduct in the care and management of the estate coming into their hands as would make them liable for any loss sustained by the estate in consequence of such action. In fine, it is seen that the character of the investigation demanded by the cross bill and of the relief sought thereby is extensive enough to call for an almost interminable amount of research and labor.. These considerations .are not"of the slightest moment when weighed against the legal rights of the parties interested in the question; and their right to have such investigation made and adequate and proper relief granted is not'a matter of discretion or of favor. If they have not slept upon their rights and if they come into court at the proper .time and in a prbper action, the court will enter upon the necessary investigation and grant such relief as they may be entitled to. On the other hand, these considerations are "most material and vital upon the question of the necessity or propriety of such an investigation in this suit which was

HARRISON v. PEREA.
Opinion of the Court.
brought for a different purpose, and which would be necessarily greatly delayed in its termination if such an inquiry. should be now entered upon.
Let us look for a moment at the simple character of this suit. It is brought to recover as administrator the assets of the estate of the minor already mentioned, the possession of which the defendant Harrison does not deny. He shows no right to them as against the complainant, because the facts he sets up in his answer form no defence. Nor do the same facts when set forth in the cross bill constitute a cause of action against this complainant, proper to be proved and defended against in this suit, as 'against the demand of the complainant herein. It is plain that the complainant, as the surviving administrator of the estate of the deceased minor, was entitled to the immediate possession of all the assets of such estate. Upon the death of the niinor the guardianship of the mother ceased, and as she was thereupon appointed administratrix, her continuing to hold the assets of the estate from the time of such appointment was as administratrix and not as guardian. The counsel for Harrison says in his brief that he is disposed to concede this proposition. It is plainly true. Her right or duty to account, as guardian, did not affect the title to the property upon the death of the ward. That title became vested in the administrator and administratrix upon their appointment. 1 Williams on Executors, (6th Am. ed.) 696. The plaintiff herein, as coadministrator, had the same legal title to the assets that she had. The advantage of possession was with her. But on the death of the administratrix the complainant remained the sole surviving administrator, and in him was vested the exclusive title and the right to the immediate possession of the assets of the estate of the deceased minor. Instead of obtaining that possession he finds all the assets in the hands of the defendant Harrison, who refuses to give them up. Their amount is not really in controversy. The defendant shows no right or title whatever to them. It is no answer to the demand that the defendant should pay over the sum which is in substance acknowledged to be in his possession, to say that -the
VOL. CLxvI-21

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.

minor's estate may be increased after an accounting shall be had and judgment obtained and the money paid over in the matter of the estate of the elder Perea. -The claim upon that estate, so far as the defendant' Harrison is concerned, either individually or as administrator of his deceased iife, is altogether too remote and too disconnected from the issues properly joined in the original suit herein to make it necessary; on his demand, to turn aside from their decision until that claim shall be hereafter and in this suit determined. It would be entering upon an investigation into inatters connected with a different estate, an inquiry into which would involve innumerable questions which would have no bearing upon the decision as to the right of defendant to retain these particular'funds now in his individual possession and treated by him as his own.
It must also be borne in mind that the defendant Harrison has an action pending against the complainant herein and the other and surviving administrator of the estate of the elder Perea, together with his other heirs-at-law, in regard to these very matters which are set up in his cross bill herein. Indeed, this cross bill contains nothing material beyond the allegations which arecontained in the complaint in his first suit. The allegations in that suit are reintroduced in the cross bill word for word, and the relief prayed for in the cross bill is the same. From all the facts thus appearing in complainant's original bill, in the answer and the cross bill of the defendant Harrison, it is plain that the matters set up in the answer and in the cross bill in regard to which the defendant seeks investigation in this suit are not proper subjects of inquiry herein, because not connected with the issues sought to be decided in the original bill, and it would result in great. and unnecessary delay in the decision of this suit to reverse this judgment and direct an investigation into matters which are foreign to its merits. We are of opinion the court below committed no error in allowing complainant's exceptions to the answer and in sustaining his demurrer to the cross bill.
The decision thus arrived at includes the main question in the case. There are some few other matters to be reviewed.

HARRISO'F v. PEREA.
Opinion of the Court.
Our further examination must proceed upon the finding of facts as made by the court below, for this being an appeal from the Supreme Court of a Territory those findings are conclusive upon this court. The jurisdiction of this court on such an appeal, apart from exceptions duly taken to rulings on the admission or rejection of evidence, is limited to determining whether the findings of fact support the judgment. Strinfelow v. Cain., 99 U. S. 610; Ne8Zin v. Well, 101 U. S. 428; Eilers v. Boatman, 111 U. S. 356; Idaho and Oregon Land Company v. Bradbury,132 U. S.509; Mfammoth Xining Company v. Salt Lake Machine Company; 151 U. S.447, 450 ; .Uaw8 v. TFictoria Copper Mining Comjany, 160 U. S. 303; Gikderleeve v. N9ew Mexico Xining Company, 161 U. S. 573; Bear Lake. and River Water Works and Irrigation Company v. Garland, 164: U. S. 1, 18.
Objection is made to that portion of the decree which holds the defendant Harrison liable as an individual for the repayment of the amount of the assets of the estate found in his possession. The findings of fact amply justify this action of the court. It is found that immediately upon the intermarriage of the defendant Harrison with the widowed mother of the minor he took entire charge and control of her affairs, including the assets of the minor's estate; that he reduced them to money, mingled the same with his own funds, deposited them in bank to his individual credit and at the time of the final decree he retained the same subject to his individual control. The court also found that he made reports in the lifetime of his wife, and in her name to the probate court, which contained false entries to the advantage of his wife, and that together they obstructed the distribution of the estate among the heirs; that upon the death of his wife on the 20th of October, 1889, he was in possession of these assets with full knowledge of their trust character, and*after her death he refused to pay over on demand, to the complainant as the sole surviving administrator of the estate of the minor, the assets pertaining to that estate. These facts show a persistent, deliberate and successful attempt'to secure and retain the assets of this estate and to convert them to his own use

individually. The facts found show that he was guilty of such conversion. Cases are cited by defendant's counsel where payments wrongfully made by an administrator to a third person could not be recovered directly from such third person at the suit of a creditor of the estate, the estate itself not being insolvent. Those cases and the one at bar have no resemblance to each other. This is a case where the whole assets of the estate have been .wrongfully and knowingly taken and converted to the individual use of this defendant, and the action is brought to recover the same by the sole surviving administrator of the estate. Nor is it a question of following the specific property which was taken by the defendant. The finding is that he reduced the assets and property of the estate to money and mingled the same with his own funds,, and has kept control of them ever since. The question of identification has nothing to do with the case. It is a bald case of the conversion of the whole estate of the minor, and his liability to pay it back is plain and clear.
Nor did the court below err to tlie prejudice of the defendant in the matter of charging him with interest at six per cent on the amount of the assets converted by him. The interest is charged by reason of his conversion of the whole assets of the estate. "It is not a mere mingling of the funds with his own, while recognizing his liability to repay them and having them at the same time ready to respond when demanded. It is a wholesale conversion of the entire assets. The facts found make the inference perfectly clear that such conversion was intended from the time of his marriage with the mother of the minor. His false entries in the reports are very strong evidence in that direction.
Neither is it a question of what profits (if any) have been made by an individual who has mingled trust fund with his own and used them for his personal benefit, although never denying his liability to account. In such cases it is sometimes proper to inquire what profits have been made in order' to charge the trustee with their amount, if greater than the usual rate of interest. This is not such a question. The defendant has, without the least right or title, taken moneys

Opinion of the Court.
belonging to the estate of a deceased minor, and converted them substantially to his own use, while denying the right of the administrator of such estate to the possession thereof. He is properly charged, at least, with the usual interest without investigation -into the question of what profits he may have made.
That portion of the decree which authorizes the complainafit as administrator to retain.his statutory commissions upon the full fund found due from the defendant is objected to, and the claim is made that he is not entitled to commission on any other sum than that which he actually receives "andpays out. The decree determines the amount due from the defendant to the complainant as administrator. Strictly speaking, the complainant was entitled to a decree for the paymert of that fall sum by the defendant, after which he would be paid the distributive share legally coming -to him. If that course had been followed and such a decree given, the complainant would have been entitled to his statutory fees, as administrator, upon the amount thus paid in - but by the favor of the court, the defendant Harrison was permitted, instead of making this formal payment, to retain in his possession the seventeen twenty-sixths of the estate which the court decided he would be entitled to ieceive from the administrator, upon his making distribution of such estate to the parties entitled to it. The court in pursuance of this course did not relieve the estate from the payment of the full afhount of the commissions of complainant as administrator which he would have been entitled to, had the amount which the defendant retained been actually and physically paid over into his hands. As to this, the defendant has no good ground of complaint.
The defendant also objects to the allowance of the solicitor's fee which is charged against the fund. We think no error arises from this action of the court below. By the exertions of the solicitor the fund was recovered, and it was properly made to bear some portion of the expense of its administration. The amount was within the judicial discretion of the court, and in fixing that amount the trial court could proceed upon its own knowledge of the value of the solicitor's services.

Opinion of the Court.

Trustees v. Greenough, 105 U. S. 527; .Fowl r v. Equitab e Trust Co., 141 U. S. 411, 415.
These are substantially all the questions which arise upon the appeal of the defendant" Harrison.
Upon the cross appeal of the complainant he seeks to modify the judgment of the Supreme C6urt in regard to the parties to the distribution, as he claims that the fund should be distributed, one half.to.the administrator of the deceased mother of the minor and the other half among his twelve half brothers and sisters, (children of. the minor's father,) to the exclusion of the minor's half brother, Grover William Harrison, (the son of his mother by her husband Harrison,) who by the judgment of the court is permitted to share in such distribution. As the trial court made that decree and the complainant did not appeal from it, and the Supreme- Court has simply affirmed that provision,, the complainant's appeal from the latter decree does not, in our opinion, bring up this question for review. All that the complainant could claim in the Supreme Court was the affirmance of the judgment as given in the court below, because, as he had not appealed from it, he could not be heard to ask for its modification or reversal. When the Supreme Court affirmed that provision of the decree the complainant's appeal from that court would not bring the propriety of the provisiofi for distribution before us.
Upon his cross appeal the complainant also asks for. a modification of the deciee with regard to the rate of interest charged against defendant, claiming it ought to be 12 instead of 6 per cent. We cannot interfere with the rate charged in the original decree, because the complainant has not appealed therefrom, and we do not think we ought to interfere with the rate of 6 per cent charged by the Supreme Court upon the total amount of the original decree froni the time it was entered. It was to a certain extent discretionary with the latter court, and we think we are riot called upon to alter and increase the rate charged by that court.
Although the complainant herein did not appeal from the
original decree entered by the trial court, yet upon defendant Harrison's appeal therefrom the Supreme Court modified the

HARISON v. PEREA.
Opinion of the Cort.
decree in some particulars, and specially in regard to costs. charging them upon the fund instead of against the defendant Harrison individually, as was the decree below. This was a modification of the judgment against the interest of and unfavorable to the complainant herein, as it reduced the amount of the fund for distribution. This question can be reviewed upon the complainant's cross appeal. Weare of opinion that there was no proper ground for the modification of the decree as to costs made by the trial court.
The defendant Harrison, by the finding of the court, has wilfully obstructed the distribution of the assets of this estate, and by his misconduct has rendered it necessary that the complainant should obtain possession of them by the institution of this suit, and the necessity for commencing it arose entirely out of his wrongful conduct. This is the finding as' approved by the Supreme Coirt of the Territory. The otJher findings, showing the false accounts, the wrongful conversion of these moneys, and the wrongful and persistent refusal to pay them over, on demand made b the administrator, altogether make out a gross case against the defendant, and leave no reasonable foundation for permitting him, as the Supreme Court does, to defend this action entirely at the expense of the fund and with no personal, responsibility for costs. We see no plausible ground for this privilege.
A clerical error seems to have been made in the distribution by the Supreme Court. One twenty-sixth part of the estate is. undisposed of by the judgment. It provides for the payment of seventeen twenty-sixths to defendant Harrison, and distributes the remaining nine twenty-sixths, one ninth to each of eight named distributees. One name has been accidentally omitted. This can be corrected on application by the court below.
The provision making all the costs payable out of the fund cannot stand, and the decree should charge defendant Harrison with costs personally as in the original decree entered by the trial court, with the exception that the amount of the fee of the special master is retained at .5500. All the costs in this court must be paid by the defendant Harri-

KARRICK v. HANNAMAIT.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF THE TERRITORY OF UTAH.
Wo. 12. Argued October 27, 28, 1896.- Decided November 29, 1897.
A partner who, within the term stipulated in the articles of partnership for its -continuance, undertakes, of his own will, and without the consent of his copartner, to dissolve the partnership, takes exclusive possession of its property and business, profitably carries on the business with the property for his own benefit, and excludes his copartner from any participation in the business or the profits, is liable (whether the partnership should or should not be considered as having been dissolved by his acts) to account to the copartner for his share of the property and of the profits of the partnership, according to the partnership agreement.
Tmis was a suit broiight April 17, 1890, in the third judicial district court of the Territory of Utah, by Hannaman against Karrick for the dissolution of a partnership, formed February -3, 1886, by an agreement in writing, by which they agreed to become partners in a mercantile and laundry business for the term of five years from that date, with a capital stock of $25,000, of which the plaintiff was to furnish $5000, and the defendant $20,000; the.defendant lent the plaintiff the sum of $5000 for five years, for which the plaintiff gave a promissory note, payable at the end of that time, and secured *by mortgage upon his interest in the partnership property; the plaintiff was to give his entire time and attention to the partnership business, and the defendant was to devote to it only such time as he should see fit; the plaintiff to have the control and management of the business generally and entirely, except as the defendant might designate, and such matters to be subject to mutual agreement; one half of the

WETZEL v. MINTESOTA RAILWAY TRANSFER COMPANY.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT.
No. 94. Argued January 25, 1898. -Decided February 21, 1898.
The decree of the Circuit Court, affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, dismissing the bill in this case on the ground of laches was correct, and that decree is affirmed.
THIS was a bill in equity filed in the United States Circuit Court for the District of Minfiesota, by the widow (since remarried) and heirs at law of George W. Remsen against the, Minnesota Railway Transfer Company, and over two hundred other defendants, to establish title to one hundred and- sixty acres of land situate within the corporate limits of the city of St. Paul, which the complainants contended was held in trust for them by the defendants. The land was estimated to be of the value of over one million dollars.
The facts of the case are substantially as follows: George W. Remsen was a private in Company K, Third Regiment, United States Infantry, and served in the Mexican war. By virtue of his enlistment as a soldier he became entitled, under section 9 of the act of Congress of February 11, 18417, c. 8, 9 Stat. 123, to locate a quarter section of government land, subject to private entry, under the regulations and restrictions established by the Commissioner of the General Land Office. This section further provided that in case of the death of

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Statement of the Case.
the soldier his right under the act should descend to his widow and minor children ; and, further, that in the event of the issuance of a land warrant to the minor children of a deceased soldier "thou the legally constituted guardian of such minor children shall, in conjunction with such of the children, if any, as may be of full age, upon being duly authorized by the orphans' or other court having probate jurisdiction, have power to sell and dispose of such certificate or warrant for the benefit of those interested."
Remsen died in the military service in October, 184:7, and thereafter a land warrant was issued on September 30, 1848, to "Elizabeth Remsen, widow, Harriet A. Remsen, Mary Ann Remsen, John W. Remsen, Elizabeth Remsen and George W. A. :Remsen, children, heirs at law, of George W. IRemsen, deceased." On October 6, 1848, Mrs. Remsen qualified as guardian of all the minor children of :Remsen, (except Harriet A., who was then seventeen years of age,) before the orphans' court for the county of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
The land warrant issued to the widow and minor children of IRemsen was never located by any or either of them, but was sold and assigned on October 11, 184:8, to one Nathan C. D. Taylor, of St. Croix County, Territory of Minnesota, who subsequently located it upon the land in controversy and to whom a patent was issued by the Government on March 20, 1850, and from whom all the defendants in this case, directly or indirectly, claim title.
The sale and assignment of the warrant were made without an order authorizing or confirming it, so far as appears, of the orphans' court appointing Mrs. Remsen as guardian, and were consummated by Mrs. Remsen, acting in her own right and as the guardian of the minor children, with whom was joined Harriet A. Remsen.
It was contended by the complainants in the Circuit Court, as well as in the Circuit Court of Appeals, that the sale and assignment of the land warrant to Taylor were utterly void as to the interests of all the minor children of George W. Remsen, other than Harriet A., who joined in the assignment, because the sale and assignment made by the mother as guar-

dian was not authorized by any order or decree of the orphans' court of the county of Philadelphia.
The Circuit Court dismissed the bill on the ground lof laches. 56 Fed. Rep. 919. Upon appeal that decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. 27 U. S. App. 594. Whereupon the complainants appealed to this court.
-Mr. Ernest Howard Hunter and -Mr.John IF. Hinsdale for appellants.
-Mr. Cushman Z. Davis for appellees. Mr. Frank B. Eellogg and fr. C. A. Severance were on his brief.
MR. JusTicE BnowN, after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the court.
The Circuit Court dismissed this bill on the ground of laches, and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed its action. There can be no doubt whatever of the correctness of this conclusion. Indeed, a stronger case for the application of the doctrine of laches can scarcely be imagined. The warrant, which was issued in 1848, entitled the widow and minor children of Remsen to a grant of one hundred and sixty acres of public hands. This warrant was never located by the persons to whom it was issued, who appeared to have lived in Philadelphia, and to have been in straitened circumstances.
The warrant was sold by them in 1848 to Nathan C. D. Taylor, and there is nothing to show that it did not realize for the widow and heirs its market value. Indeed, the Court of Appeals found that it was sold for its full value, and the widow testified that the proceeds were applied to the support of her,self and the minor children of the deceased soldier. No fraud in the transaction was alleged or proved. Nothing appears to impeach the validity of the sale, except the fact that the widow, who had been appointed guardian of all the minor children, except the eldest, did not procure the consent of the orphans' court in Philadelphia to make the sale, as required by the

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.
statute. This was doubtless a technical defect; but it did not show that the warrant was not actually transferred by the widow, acting for herself and her children, (except one who consented in her own behalf,) or that they did not receive full consideration for such transfer.
It is true that the locator and his grantees in possession may have been in law chargeable with the knowledge that an order of the orphans' court was never obtained; but in view of the fact that the widow and heirs of Remsen lived in Philadelphia, a thousand miles from St. Paul, it is scarcely a matter of surprise that they did not investigate this subject with that care which they probably would have exercised had that court been more accessible. Particularly is this so, when it is considered that the officers of the land department, subsequently and after a full review of the facts, decided the warrqnt to have been properly transferred to Taylor, and issued a patent to him.
It was not the foresight of the widow or heirs of IRemsen which caused this warrant to be located upon lands so near to the thriving city of St. Paul, but that of Taylor, who appears to have been a resident of Minnesota; and this suit is a manifest attempt. of the complainants to take to themselves the benefit of his action, in which they did not participate and of which they were entirely ignorant for over thirty years after the location had been made.
Conceding that the minors were not affected by laches until they became of age, it appears that the youngest of them reached his majority in 1863, at which time the lands were worth about 81500. Then, if not before, the exercise of diligence became incumbent upon them. It was their duty to have informed theniselves and to have acted. It is scarcely possible that they should not have known that their father was a soldier in the Mexican war, and they were chargeable by law with knowledge of the fact that he was entitled to a land warrant. If they did not know this as a matter of fact it was because their mother and eldest sister had failed to inform them of it; and it is inequitable to charge upon the defendants the entire consequences of this ignorance.

WETZEL v. =1 ESOTA R AILWAY COMIPANY. 24:1
Opinion of the Court.
Knowledge of the transfer seems to have *finally come to them, not through any exertion of their own to inform themselves of the facts, but by an accidental meeting with a lawyer from Minnesota, who had in some way, probably by an examination of the title, become cognizant of the defect in the transfer. It was a mere matter of chance when they would be informed of the defect in the defendants' title, or whether it would ever come to their knowledge at all. To permit them now, after a lapse of forty-four years from the time the warrant was issued, and of thirty years from the time the youngest child became of age, to impeach the transaction, would be an act of the most flagrant injustice to the present holders of the property. This property, which was probably not worth more than one or two hundred dollars at the time of the location of the land warrant, is now estimated to be worth at least a million, and is covered, or partly covered, by houses and business blocks. In the forty-four years that have elapsed since the warrant was issued these lands have been platted and sold in lots to purchasers, who were probably ignorant in fact, if not in law, of any defect in the title, and relied upon the validity of the transfer from the widow and heirs of Remsen and upon the patent from the 'United States, which appears to have been regularly issued after an examination of all the facts attending the granting, transfer and location of the land warrant by the officers of the land department. While the fact that the complainants were ignorant of the defect in the title and were without means to prosecute an investigation into the facts may properly be considered by the court, it does not mitigate the hardship to the defendants of unsettling these titles. If the complainant may put forward these excuses for delay after thirty years, there is no reason why they may not allege the same as an excuse after a lapse of sixty. The truth is, there must be some limit of time within which these excuses shall be available, or titles might forever be insecure. The interests of public order and tranquillity demand that parties shall acquaint themselves with their rights within a reasonable time, and although this time may be extended by their actual ignorance, or want of means, it is by no means illimitable.

OCTOBER TERTIf, 189L.
Opinion of the Court.
If any authority were needed for the action of the courts below in dismissing the bill upon the ground of laches, it would be found in Felix v. Patrick, 145 U. S. 317. In that case a half-breed woman, belonging to the Sioux nation, received in 1857 a certificate of land scrip, issued under the then existing law, which provided that no "transfer or conveyance of any of said certificates shall be valid." Notwithstanding this provision the woman sold the scrip and executed a blank power of attorney, also a quitclaim deed in blank, in which the name of the attorney, the description of the land and the name of the grantee were afterwards filled in by the grantee, who had caused the papers to be executed. The grantee thereafter located a tract of land, and subsequently Congress confirmed his title to the same. The half-breed was ignorant of all these facts until 1887. In 1888, she having died in the meantime, her representatives filed a bill in equity against the grantee, charging him with having fraudulently obtained the power of attorney and the quitclaim deed, but failing to state when and how the frauds were discovered. It was held that as the bill did not state the time when the frauds were discovered, so that the court might clearly see whether they could have been discovered before, the bill was fatally defective; and, that under the circumstances, it would be inequitable to disturb the title of the defendants, who held adversely as against the halfbreed woman, and not by virtue of the power of attorney or quitclaim deed, which passed no title, or by the confirmatory act of Congress which granted no additional rights.
Upon the facts disclosed in this record, it is entirely clear that the decree of the court below was correct, and it is therefore

LEYSON v. DAVIS.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF MONTANA.
No. 517. Submitted March 14, 198.-Decided April 11, 1598.
In a suit commenced in a court of the State of Montana by the administrator of the donor of national bank stock, no written assignment having been made, against the donee to compel the delivery of the certificates to the plaintiff, and against the bank to require it to make a transfer of the stock to the plaintiff, the donee set up that the gift was voluntarily made to him by his father in his lifetime, causa mortis, and on trial it was decided that he was the owner of such stockand of the certificates, and was entitled to have new certificates therefor issued to him by the bank; and a decree having been entered accordingly, it was sustained by the Supreme Court of the State upon appeal. Held, that these matters raised no Federal question; that no title, right, privilege or immunity was specially set up or clhimed by the administrator under a law of the United States, and denied by the highest tribunal of the States; and that the controversy was merely as to which of the claimants had the superior equity to those shares of stock, and the national banking act was only collaterally involved.

TLEYSON v. DAVIS.
Statement of the Case.
Tnis was an action commenced by the special administrator of the estate of Andrew J. Davis, deceased, and continued in the name of his successor, Leyson, administrator with the will annexed, against Andrew J. Davis, Jr., and the First National Bank of Butte, in the District Court of the State of -AMontana for the.county of Silver Bow, to recover nine hundred and fifty shares of the capital stock of the defendant bank, alleged by the administrat jr to belong to the estate of the deceased, and claimed by the defendant Davis, Jr., under a donatio causamortis. The prayer of the complaint was that the claim of defendant Davis, Jr., to the stock be declared void; that he be compelled to deliver up the certificates; and that the bank be required to transfer the same on its books and issue new certificates to plaintiff as administrator.
The answer of Davis, Jr.,-in addition to his defence, set up affirmative matter, and prayed that he be adjudged the owner of the stock; that plaintiff as administrator and.the estate be decreed to have no right or interest therein; and that the bank be required to make the proper transfers upon its books to him. The bank answered that it was ready and willing to transfer the shares of stock to the party determined by the court
entitled to the same. The trial court found as facts, in substance, that in the lat-
ter part of December, 1889, Andrew J. Davis was, and had been for some months, seriously and dangerously ill, suffering from an ailment of which he died in the month of March following; that being so ill, and in view and expectation of death, but being of sound and disposing mind, he gave to defendant Andrew J. Davis, as a gift, the shares of stock and certificates thereof described in the complaint, afid at the same time de'livered the certificates to said Andrew J., who then and there received and accepted the same, and who has ever since said gift and delivery retained and held the shares of stock and certificates in his possession, and claimed them as his own; that the deceased had great affection for and confidence in defendant Andrew J., .and at the time of the gift of the stock and certificates, and for several years prior thereto, it was and -had been the intention of the deceased to give the stock and

certificates to said Andrew J.; that there was no written assignment of the stock or certificates, or power of attorney executed by deceased in connection with the gift, nor any written authority empowering Andrew J., or any other person for him, to transfer the stock and certificates on the books of the bank during the lifetime of the donor, and that there was no transfer made on the books of the bank to Andrew J.; that no other gift than the gift of the stock was made, or attempted to be made, by the deceased to Andrew J.; that the gift of the stock was an absolute gift, and was a valid gift mortis cdiusa; and that defendant Andrew J. had ever since held possession and exercised control and dominion over the stock, with the knowledge of the donor to the time of his death, arising and resulting only from the fact of the gift and the donee's possession. It was, therefore, concluded that defendant Andrew J. Davis was the owner of the stock and certificates described in the complaint, and entitled to have the shares transferred to him on the books of the bank, and to have new certificates issued to him therefor; that the donor was divested of his possession, dominion and controi of said shares of stock by the gift; that the plaintiff, as administrator, had not, nor had the estate of the deceased, any right, title or claim in or to the shares of stock or certificates, and that defendant Andrew J. was entitled to a decree in accordance with the prayer of his answer.
The decree was accordingly so entered. On appeal the Supreme Court of Montana reviewed the facts and the law at length, and elaborately discussed the authorities both in England and in this country; sustained the claim of -defendant Davis to the stock; and affirmed the decree. 17 Montana, 220.

LEYSON v. DAVIS.
Opinion of the Court.
Mi. CHIEi JUSTICE FULLER delivered the opinion of the court.
The Supreme Court of Montana held that as between donor and donee a valid gift of the stock was made by the delivery thereof, without a transfer of the shares on the books of the bank or ipdorsement on the back of the certificates themselves, which carried the equitable title and entitled the donee to call for the legal title as against the representative of the donor's estate. This conclusion was arrived at solely on principles of general law-, and in itself involved the disposition of no Federal question.
It is true that by section 5139 of the Revised Statutes shares of the capital stock of national 'banks are declared to be personal property, "transferable on the books of the association in such manner as may be prescribed in the by-laws or articles of association;" and it is conceded by defendant in error that by one of the by-laws of defendant bank it was prescribed that its stock should be "assignable and transferable only on the books of this bank, subject to the restrictions and provisions of the banking laws, and transfer books shall be provided, in which all assignments and transfers of stock shall be made. No transfer of stock shall be made without the consent of the board of directors by any stockholder who shall be liable, either as principal debtor or otherwise ;" and that the certificates in question contained the provision: "Transferable only by him or his attorney on the books of this bank on the' surrender of this certificate." -
But these matters raised no Federal question. The rights of third parties,' or of creditors, or of the bank, were not in issue or determined here, but simply the equities as between the particular parties. The representative of the donor was manifestly bound by the donor's' valid acts, and could assert no right superior to his. His right to make the gift was the right to dispose of his own property, and whether as between him-and his donee the equitable title passed was a question of general or local law. The administrator's claim that he was entitled t& receive the stock as representing the estate or for

the benefit of the next of kin rested on that law as administered by the courts of the State.
So far as the act of Congress is concerned, we understand the doctrine to be, as stated in Johnston v. Laftin, 103 U. S. 800, 804, that.: ." The transferability of shares in the national banks is not governed by different rules from those which are ordinarily applied to the transfer of shares in other corporate bodies."
,In Black v. Zacharie,3 How. 483, 513, it was said: "It is true that the charters of the Carrollton Bank and of the Gaslight and Banking Company provide that no transfer of the stock of these corporations shall be valid or effectual until such transfers shall be entered or registered in a book or books to be kept for that purpose by the corporation. But this is manifestly a regulation designed for the security of the bank itself, and of third persons taking transfers of the stock without notice of any prior equitable transfer. It relates to the transfer of the lefgal title, and not of any equitable interest in the stock subordinate to that title. In the case of the Union Bank of- Georgetown v. Laird, 2 Wheat. 390, this court took notice of the-distindtion between the- legal and equitable title in 'cases of bank stock, where the charter of the bank had provided for the mode of transfer. The general construction which has been put upon the charters of other banks containing similar provisions as to the transfer of their stock, is, thatthe provisions are designed solely for the safety and security of the bank itself, and of purchasers without notice; and that as between vendor and vendee a transfer, not in conformity to such provisions, is good to pass the equitable title and divest the vendor of all interest in the stock. Such are the decisions in the cases of the Bank of Utica v. Smalley, 2 Cowen, 770, 777, 778; Gilbertv. .ManchesterIron Co., A1 Wend. 628; Coifmercial Ban.k of Buffalo v.

It is sufficient to say of them, that they have no application to cases where the legislature had adjudged that a limitation is necessary for the preservation of the health of employ~s, and there are reasonable grounds for believing that such determination is supported by the facts. The question in each case is whether the legislature has adopted the statute in exercise of a reasonable discretion, or whether its action be a mere excuse for an unjust discrimination, or the oppression, or spoliation of a particular class. The distinction between these two different classes of enactments cannot be better stated than by a comparison of the views of this court found in the opinions in Barbierv. Connolly, 113 U.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION v. MEECH.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
No. 191. Argued January12, 1898. -Decided February29, 1598.
In the District of Columbia it is the rule that when, upon a purchase of real estate the conveyance of the legal title is to one person while the consideration is paid by another, an implied or resulting trust arises, which may be shown by parol proof; and the grantee in the conveyance will be held, on such evidence, as trustee for the party from whom the consideration proceeds, whose rights will be enforced as against those claiming under the record title.

SIITHSONIAN INSTITUTION v. ATEECH.
Statement of the Case.
This case comes within that rule, the evidence being clear and satisfactory that the oral agreement made between Mr. and Mrs. Avery, at the time when the property was conveyed to the latter, was made as asserted by the Smithsonian Institution.
Such being established as the fact, it is the duty of a court of equity to recognize that agreement as against the legal effect of the conveyance to Mrs. Avery.
The presumption that when the consideration for a deed is paid by a husband, and the conveyance is made to his wife, the conveyance is intended for her benefit, is one of fact which can be overthrown by proof of the real intent of the parties.
When a testator declares in his will that his several bequests are made upon the condition that the legatees acquiesce in the provisions of his will, no legatee can, without compliance with that condition, receive his bounty, or be put in a position to use it in an effort to thwart his expressed purposes.
ON June 4, 1895, the appellant, as plaintiff, filed its bill in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia to enforce certain rights claimed under a will made by Robert S. Avery, on July 22, 1893. In this will, after sundry bequests to his own relatives, is the following:
"I bequeath to the sister and brothers of my late wife one thousand dollars (1000) to be equally divided between them. I have already given these last over a thousand dollars which my wife inherited from her father, also clothing and other gifts, thus equalizing substantially my gifts to her family and to mine. These bequests are all made upon the condition that the legatees acquiesce in this will and I hereby bequeath the share or shares of any disputing this will to the residuary legatee hereinafter named.
"All the rest and residue of my estate, of whatsoever nature, real, personal or mixed and wheresoever situate, I hereby give, devise and bequeath unto the Smithsonian Institute, a body corporate by virtue of the laws of the United States, of which institution Samuel P. Langley is now secretary, having its legal residence in the District of Columbia, unto it and its successors forever.
"Kaving always had a love for the sciences, and having acquired most of my property while toiling in humble capacities to extend and diffuse knowledge, I have concluded that

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Statement of the Case.
the residuary gift above made to the Smithsonian Institution will best express my interest in science. As my labors have been directed to the invention and use of phonetic type, I desire, but do not require, that the income derived by the Smithsonian Institution from this gift may be applied, so far as it may determine, to promoting publications in such type of scientific publication, especially of such publications as may relate to phonetic type and printing. I also desire, but by no means require, that such part of said income as the said institution shall determine shall be applied to -the publication of lectures and treatises upon and concerning those mechanical laws governing an ethereal medium which are treated of in atomic chemistry, and which are supposed to govern phenomena of electricity, magnetism, light and heat. Prizes might be given for essays on these subjects and upon such other kindred subjects as may meet the approval of the institution. I would like, however, to have published first the multiplying table and also PV-plate logarithms, publication of the table of squares, cubes, square roots, cube roots, reciprocals, prime numbers and factors, some of which I have written out. If the institution shall approve, the fund derived from the residuary bequest shall be called 'the Avery fund' or 'the fund contributed by Robert S. Avery and his wife Lydia T. Avery, for the extension of the sciences,' and all publications made from the fund shall bear this inscription.
"The property known as part of lot 2 (two) in square 787 in the city of Washington, D.C., being premises No. 326 A street S.E., is my property, although the title stands in my wife's name. I include it in the residuary bequest to the 
Smithsonian Institution." The testator died childless on September 12, 1894. The
will was probated February 2, 1895. He and his wife had lived for many years in Washington, he being in the employ of the Government in the Coast Survey Office. During these years he lived a quiet and retired life, devoting himself to scientific research, and experimenting chiefly in the matter of phonetic type. His wife was younger than he, and was, until shortly before her death, on November 18, 1890, in apparently

Opinion of the Court.
good health. While they were both living, and on April 20, 1885, the real estate described in the last paragraph quoted from the will was purchased, the title being conveyed to Mrs. Avery.
The bill alleged that the lot was paid for with the money of Robert Avery; that the title was taken in the name of Mrs. Avery because it was supposed that she would outlive .her husband and upon an understanding and agreement that the property should, after their deaths, pass to the Smithsonian Institution in pursuance of a mutual desire to make their gift to this institution as large as possible; that notwithstanding these facts the defendants, other than the executrix, claimed title to the property as the heirs of Mrs. Avery, and had demanded possession. The prayer was for a finding and decree that the equitable title was in Robert Avery, and passed to the plaintiff by his last will; that the defendants be enjoined from claiming any title thereto, and that the executrix be directed to treat the thousand dollars bequeathed to the sister and brothers as forfeited for breach of condition annexed to said legacy, and as having fallen into the residuum. After answer, testimony was taken and the case was heard before Justice Hagner of the Supreme Court, who rendered a decree in accordance with the prayer of the bill, so far as respects the lot, but denying the relief sought as to the legacy on condition of the defendants executing a release of all claims to the realty. On appeal by all of the defendants, except the executrix, the Court of Appeals reversed the decree of the Supreme Court and remanded the case with directions to dismiss the bill. 8 App. D. C. 490.

in 1885 to Mrs. Avery. She died without will. Prima facie, therefore, the title then passed to her heirs, the appellees. The plaintiff insists that in fact the purchase price was paid by Mr. Avery and paid under an oral agreement, whereby a resulting trust was created which changed the course of the title, and the first questions are, whose money paid for the lot, and was there such an agreement, and, if so, what were its terms?
That the money which was used in making payment for the lot was the money of Mr. Avery, is not seriously questioned. Both Mr. and Mrs. Avery lived very economically, and this money was accumulated out of savings from the salary he received from the Government. At the time of their marriage Mrs. Avery had a small amount of money on deposit in a savings bank in Connecticut, and the books of the bank showed that no part of that amount was drawn out at or near the time of this conveyance. Her repeated declarations were to the same effect, and that Mr. Avery's money had paid for the property.
The trial court also found that there was an oral agreement - an agreement made at the time the property was conveyed to Mrs. Avery, that she should hold the property during her lifetime, and that she should make a will by which it should pass at her death to the Smithsonian Institution. The Court of Appeals held that the testimony did not establish the alleged agreement so clearly as to justify a court of equity in recognizing it as against the legal effect of the conveyance. We are constrained to differ with the Court of Appeals and to agree with the justice of the Supreme Court. In a careful and exhaustive opinion Justice Hagner reviewed the evidence, and his conclusions therefrom commend themselves"to our judgment. In view of this opinion it seems unnecessary to recapitulate all the testimony, and we shall content ourselves with stating the salient features thereof.
Mr. Avery was for some thirty-two years in the employ of the Government, and was an enthusiast in the scientific studies which he was pursuing in connection with such service. Prior to the purchase of the lot in controversy, and on Sep-

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION v. MEECH.
Opinion of the Court.
tember 13, 1882, he had made a will, in which, after giving to his "wife Lydia T. Avery, if she outlives me, in trust while she lives, all my real estate and personal property to hold and to use for her support as long as she lives, and to keep in good condition for its final disposition," he declared:
"Having always had a love for the sciences, and having acquired most of my property while toiling in humble capacities to extend and diffuse knowledge, I have concluded to give all my real and personal property, with such exceptions as I may make hereafter in this will or in codicils annexed thereto, to the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution to provide for its safekeeping and to use the income from it in extending the sciences by publishing," etc.
And again: "This fund may be called 'the Avery fund' or 'the fund contributed by Robert S. Avery and his wife Lydia T. Avery for the extension of the sciences,' and all publications made with this fund must have a note thereon stating that they have been thus published. "After the death of my wife, the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution will be expected to select an executor of this will and provide for making the fund as useful as possible, limiting its use as much as they can to the objects specified." His wife was fifteen or twenty years younger than he, and the expectation of both was that she would outlive him, though in fact she died some four years before he did, he living to be 86 years of age. After her death, on December 20, 1892, he prepared a codicil to the will of 1882, in which he recited that the conveyance of the property in question was made to his wife with his consent and upon the express understanding and condition that she should make a will in his favor, and that he had as evidence of this filed several affidavits of her statements in respect to the matter. Subsequently he executed the will of July 22, 1893, under which this suit was brought. The wills and codicil above referred to furnish indisputable evidence that prior to the purchase of

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.
the real estate in controversy Mr. Avery intended that all his property, after certain legacies were paid, should go to the Smithsonian Institution, and that he understood that when the deed of this property was made to his wife it was upon the agreement described. That the agreement was made is clearly and positively testified to by one witness, Leland P. Shidy, who was associated in the government service with Mr. Avery, was the intimate friend of both Mr. and Mrs. Avery, living in the house with them from time to time during the years from 1873 to her death. We quote from his testimony:
"Q. Do you recollect the circumstance of the purchase by Mr. Avery of the property No. 326 A street southeast, in this city?
"A. Yes; I do. I was at their house at the time when they began talking about making the purchase, and they discussed it, in the first place, as to the advisability of getting the property at all, and after that was decided they discussed as to how the deed had better be made out, and Mrs. Avery thought it would be best to put the deed in her name, although her husband's money was paying for it exclusively, and he thought best to do so and had the deed made out in her name.
"Q. Did Mrs. Avery state any reason why the deed should be made out in her name?
"A. Yes. She wanted it in her name, in the first place, because she wanted to have the control of that property, as it was immediately contiguous to her own home, and then she thought she would be pretty certain to outlive her husband, and that it would be better in case of his death to have the title iii her name than in his name.
"Q. State what final disposition, if any, was agreed upon by these two persons in your presence.
"A. It was agreed that she should have the property during her lifetime, and that she should make a will transferring it at her death to the Smithsonian Institute.
"Q. I understand that this conversation which you are now testifying to took place at or about the time of the actual pur-

SMITHISONIAN INSTITUTION v. MEECH.
Opinion of the Court.
chase and the making of the deed. Was any reference made to the ownership of this property that you can now recollect subsequent to the date when it was bought?
"A. After that they referred to it in a number of interviews while I was present, and every time they alluded to it with the same understanding -that is, that the property was to be hers during her lifetime and was to be disposed of at her death, in accordance with the will of Mr. Avery, with the rest of his property."
In addition there was the testimony of several witnesses of repeated conversations with Mrs. Avery, in which she made statements to the same effect. In a lease of the property made in 1887 Mr. Avery was named as the lessor. The receipts for rent given monthly for several years were signed by him alone, and so signed in her presence. There is nothing to contradict or discredit this evidence. While it may be true that no witness but the one was present at the time the agreement was entered into between Mr. and Mrs. Avery, yet his testimony is corroborated in the various ways to which we have referred. There is no arbitrary rule requiring the direct testimony of any particular number of witnesses to the ultimate fact. It is enough that there be a certainty in respect to it, and that certainty may result from an accumulation of direct and indirect evidences. The law is content if from a perusal of the entire record the mind is sure that there was a distinct agreement as claimed. That Mr. Avery understood that the agreement was made as stated the documentary evidence places beyond doubt; that it was in fact made, Mr. Shidy's testimony attests; and that Mrs. Avery understood that it was so made is evident not merely from Mr. Shidy's testimony but from her statements to many others. The will executed in 1882, and before the purchase of this lot, discloses his intent that all his property, save a few specific bequests, should go to the Smithsonian, and that the fund created thereby should bear his wife's as well as his own name, and the evidence makes it clear that she shared in his desire to make this fund as large as possible. While we agree to the proposition that parol testimony to overthrow the legal effect

OCTOBER TERM, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.
of conveyances must be clear and satisfactory, yet we think this case comes within the scope of that rule, and that it is certain that just such an agreement was made between husband and wife as the appellant asserts. Even if it were a criminal case, we should not hesitate to hold that the evidence was sufficient to establish the fact beyond a reasonable doubt. It is true Mr. Avery in the codicil speaks of the agreement on the part of Mrs. Avery as one to make a will in his favor, while Mr. Shidy says that the agreement was that she should make a will transferring the property after her death to the Smithsonian, but this slight difference is immaterial and does ndt discredit the testimony. The Smithsonian was to be the ultimate beneficiary, and the manner in which this should be accomplished was merely a matter of detail, in respect to which the memory of the witnesses might differ. Indeed, Mr. Shidy does not purport to give the exact language used, but merely states the substance of the agreement.
We pass, therefore, to the further question: If it is true that the purchase price was paid by Mr. Avery, and the title conveyed to Mrs. Avery under an oral agreement, such as is described, will equity enforce this as against those claiming the record title?
The Court of Appeals was of the .opinion that the agreement on the part of Mrs. Avery created an express trust, which, resting only in parol was invalid under the statute of frauds. It recognized the doctrine that an implied or resulting trust arises by operation of law, whenever one person buying and paying for an estate has the title placed in the name of another; but held that where the title is conveyed to a wife or bhild, or other person for whom the one paying the purchase money is under an obligation, legal or moral, to provide, no presumption of a trust arises, and that it is incumbent on one who claims the existence of such a trust to establish it by clear, positive and unequivocal proof, and that this had not been done in the present case. It did not substantially disagree with Mr. Justice Hagner on the propositions of law laid down by him, but differed mainly as to the strength and effect of the evidence.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION v. MEECH.
Opinion of the Court.
The general proposition is unquestioned that, where upon a purchase of property the conveyance of the legal title is to one person while the consideration is paid by another, an implied or resulting trust immediately arises, and the grantee in the conveyance will be held as trustee for the party from whom the consideration proceeds.
"This rule has its foundation in the natural presumption, in the absence of all rebutting circumstances, that he who supplies the purchase money intends the purchase to be for his own benefit, and not for another, and that the conveyance in the name of another is a matter of convenience and arrangement between the parties for collateral purposes, and this rule is vindicated by the experience of mankind." 1 Perry on
Trusts, (4th ed.)  126.
The nature of this trust may be shown by parol evidence. This is in express accord with the, provisions of the statute of
frauds. Comp. Stat. D. 0. 231,  8, 9. The first of these
sections requires that all declarations or creations of trust or confidence in respect to real estate shall be manifested and proved by some writing. Section 9 reads:
".Pmovided, always, That where any conveyance shall be made of any lands or tenements by which a trust or confidence shall or may arise or result by the implication or construction of law, or be transferred or extinguished by an act or operation of law, then and in every such case, such trust or confidence shall be of the like force and effect as the same would have been if this statute had not been made; anything hereinbefore contained to the contrary notwithstanding."
There is no statute in force in this District, such as is found in some States, putting an end to implied and resulting trusts. It is true that when the consideration is paid by a hdsband and the conveyance made to his wife there is a presumption that such a conveyance was intended for her benefit; .but. this is not a presumption of law but of fact, and can be overthrown by proof of the real intent of the parties.
"1Whethera purchase in the name of a wife or child is an advancement or not, is a question of pure intention, though presumed in the first instance to be a provision and settle-

ment; therefore, any antecedent or contemporaneous acts or facts may be received, either to rebut or support the presumption, and any acts or facts so immediately after the purchase as to be fairly considered a part of the transaction may be received for the same purpose. And so the declarations of the real purchaser, either before or at the time of the purchase, may be received to show whether he intended it as an advancement or a trust. Such declarations are received, not as declarations of a trust by parol or otherwise, but as evidence to show what the intention was at the time." 1 Perry on Trusts, (4th ed.)  147; see also 2 Pomeroy's Eq. Juris.
1041, and cases cited in notes. This is in accord with the general proposition so often enunciated, that the statute of frauds was designed to prevent frauds, and that courts of equity will not permit it to be used to accomplish that which it was designed to prevent. As said in Wood v. Babe, 96 N. Y. 414, 425 "There are two principles upon which a court of equity acts in exercising its remedial jurisdiction. . . . One is that it will not permit the statute of frauds to be used as an insfrument of fraud, and the other, that when a person through the influence of a confidential relation acquires title to property, or obtains an advantage which he cannot conscientiously retain, the court, to prevent the abuse of confidence, will grant relief." And in JHaighv. Eaye, L. R. 7 Ch. App. 469, 474: "The words of Lord Justice Turner, in the case of Lincol& v. T right, 4 De G. & J. 16, where he said, ' The principle of this court is that the statute of frauds was not made to cover fraud,' express a principle upon which this court has acted in numerous instances, where the court has refused to allow a man to take advantage of the statute of frauds to keep another man's property which he has obtained through fraud." If Mrs. Avery had during her lifetime conveyed this property to her sister and brothers it would have been a fraudulent breach of trust, and the like result follows if, now that she has died without executing a will, her heirs are permitted to take the property which was conveyed to her, not

SMITHSONIANL INSTITUTION v. ALEECH.
Opinion of the Court.
as an advancement, but on an agreement that it should subsequently pass to this plaintiff.
The existence of an express agreement does not destroy the resulting trust. It was not an agreement made by one owning and having the legal title to real estate by which an express trust was attempted to be created, but it was an agreement prior to the vesting of title -an agreement which became a part of and controlled the conveyance; and evidence of its terms is offered, not for the purpose of establishing an express trust, but of nullifying the presumption of an advancement and to indicate the disposition which the real owner intended should be made of the property.
In Robinson v. Leftore, 59 Mississippi, 148, 151, it was said: "If the facts make out a case of resulting trust independently of the agreement, relief will not be denied because of the agreement; it being well settled that an invalid agreement cannot destroy an otherwise good cause of action, and this is no less true of resulting trusts than of other legal rights." feller v. .Yunkel, 46 Maryland, 565.
It may not be amiss to notice a few of the authorities. Slerman v. Shernan, 20 D. 0. Rep. 330, is in point. In that case the husband made an agreement with his wife to buy real estate in her name, and that she should execute a will devising it to him. He bought one piece of real estate in her name, and she made a will so devising it. Subsequently he, in like manner, bought another piece, and, under the supposition that the will covered this after-acquired property, she made no new will, but died intestate as to that property, and it was ruled that a minor daughter, who inherited the title, held it in trust for him. In Livingston v. Livingston, 2 Johns. Oh. 537, it appeared that husband and wife agreed orally that he should purchase -a lot in her name and build a house thereon, and that he should be reimbursed the cost thereof out of the proceeds of another house and lot of which she was seized, which should be sold for that purpose. The husband having executed the agreement upon his part, the contract failed by the sudden death of the wife, who left infant children, to whom the legal estate in both lots descended; and

OCTOBER TER-M, 1897.
Opinion of the Court.
it was held that the agreement should be carried into effect, and the lot which originally belonged to the wife was ordered to be sold and the husband reimbursed out of the proceeds. In his opinion the Chancellor said (p. 539) :
"The presumption would undoubtedly be, in the first instance, that the conveyance to the wife was intended as an advancement and provision for her. This presumption was admitted in the case of Kingdon v. Bridges, 2 Vern. 67, but I do not see why it may not be rebutted, as has been done in this case, by parol proof. In Finch v. Finch, 15 Vesey, 43, it was held, that though when a purchase is made in the name of a person who does not pay the purchase money, the party paying it is considered in equity as entitled, yet if the person whose name is used be a child of the purchaser, it is,yrima facie, an advancement, but that it was competent for the father to show, by proof, that he did not intend advancement, but used the name of his child only as a trustee."
Cotton v. Wood, 25 Iowa, 43. Here the facts were that the husband purchased a lot and had the same conveyed to his wife under an agreement that she would convey it to hihh, or to whomsoever he might assign his interest therein, upon his request. The wife died without making any conveyance, and it was held that the husband might maintain a suit to compel a conveyance to him by her heirs, the court saying:
"Where, upon the purchase of property, the consideration is paid by one, and the legal title conveyed to another, a resulting trust is thereby raised, and the person named in the deed will hold the property as trustee of the party paying the coiisideration. See Hill on Trustees, 91, and authorities cited in notes; 2 Story's Eq. Juris.  1201. But if the person to whom the conveyance is made be one for whom the party paying the consideration is under obligation, natural or moral, to provide, the transaction will be regarded prima facie as an advancement, and the burden will rest on the one who seeks to establish the trust for the benefit of the payee of the consideration, to overcome the presumption in favor of the legal title by sufficient evidence.
"This presumption, though strong, is not conclusive. Hill

Somewhat analogous is In re -Duke of .farlborough, L. R. 2 Oh. Div. 1894, 133, in which it appeared that the Duchess of Marlborough conveyed certain property to her husband, that he mortgaged the property for the purpose of raising money with which to pay his debts, she joining in the mortgage. Upon his death the Duchess claimed to be entitled to the property, subject to the mortgage, on the ground that it was part of the arrangement between them that he should reconvey to her, and it was held that she was entitled to such reconveyance.
We think it clear from these authorities, and many others that might be cited, (see White. and Tudor's Leading Cases in Equity, (4th ed.) vol. 1, part 1, p. 314 and following, where the authorities are collated and the question discussed at length,) that the doctrine of an implied and resulting trust applies to a case in which the husband advances the purchase price for property which is conveyed to his wife, and that though it be true there is a presumption that the conveyance was intended as an advancement for her benefit, yet such presumption is subject to overthrow by proof of an agreement that such was not the purpose of the conveyance. And so the case comes back to the question of fact in respect to which we have already expressed our conclusions, whether there was sufficiently clear and positive evidence that this conveyance to Mrs. Avery was not intended as an advancement, but was made simply for the purposes of convenience and upon the agreement that this lot, together with other property belonging to Mr. Avery, should pass after both were dead to the Smithsonian Institution.
The remaining question .arises upon the condition named in'

That these legatees did not acquiesce in the will is clear, not alone from the fact that prior to any suit they made demand for the possession of the realty, but also from the further fact that after the decree in the trial court, which, while denying any right to the real estate, at the same time provided for their receipt of the legacy upon filing a written relinquishment of all claims to the real estate, they persisted in carrying on the litigation by appeal to the Court of Appeals, insisting there as here upon their right to the property. It is obvious that in inserting this condition the testator had in mind the specific property hereinbefore considered. In the first will, made prior to the purchase of the property, no such provision is found. He was under no apprehension of any dispute as to the proposed disposition of his entire estate. But in a second codicil thereto executed after the death of his wife, and when, by her failing to execute a will as agreed upon, it became apparent that some question might be made concerning the ownership of this property, he did incorporate a somewhat similar provision. There is, however, a marked difference between the language there used and that here found. That ]anguage was, "these gifts are made on the condition that no attempt be made to break this will, and that if such an attempt be made, those who engage in it are to lose their claims to the gifts here made to them." That might be construed to forbid, under the penalty of losing the bequests, a contest of the will, any "disputing of the will," in the ordinary and natural meaning of those words, by denying that it was a lawful will, duly executed and attested by a testator of sound mind and not acting under undue influence. The language here used is that "these bequests are all made upon the condition that the legatees acquiesce in this will, and I hereby bequeath the share or shares of any disputing this will to the residuary legatee hereinafter named." In other words, acquiescence in the will as a will, and in all its provisions, is the condition upon which the legatees can take their bequests. It is not confined to mere acquiescence in his.selection of the residuary

legatee, but in his declaration as to the title to any named property and his devise of that property. No legatee is to receive a bequest who shall controvert that which he has stated to be a fact, or attempt to prevent that specific disposition of any property which he has made. And in case of a failure to comply with this condition the bequest is given over to the residuary legatee. The authorities fully warrant this conclusion.
"When legacies are given to persons upon conditions not to dispute the validity of, or the dispositions in wills or testaments, the conditions are not in general obligatory, but only in termorem. If, therefore, there exist probabilid causa litigandi, the non-observance of the conditions will not be forfeitures. Powell v. -Morgan, 2 Vern. 90; .Morris v. Burroughs, 1 Atk. 404; loyd v. Spillet, 3 P. Wins. 344. The reason seems to be this: A court of equity does not consider that the testator'meant such a clause to determine his bounty, if the legatee resorted to such a tribunal to ascertain doubtful rights under the will, or how far his other interests might be affected by it; but merely to guard against vexatious litigation.
"But when the acquiescence of the legatee appears to be a material ingredient in the gift, which is made to determine upon his controverting the will or any of its provisions, and in either of those events the legacy is given over to another person, the restriction no longer continues a condition in terrorem, but assumes the character of a conditional limitation. The bequest is only quousque, the legatee shall refrain fi'om disturbing the will; and, if he controvert it, his interest will cease and pass to the other legatee." 1 Roper on Legacies, 2d Am. Ed. 795; 4th Lond. Ed.
In Cooke v. Turner, 14: Sim. 493, the testator after giving to his daughter certain benefits out of his real estate revoked them and gave the estates over in case his daughter should dispute his will, or his competency to make it, or should refuse to confirm it when required by his executors. The daughter refused to confirm the will, and a suit having been instituted to establish it the daughter" disputed its validity and the compe-

tency of her father to make it. It was held that the clause of revocation was valid; that the gift over took effect, and that the benefits given by the will to the daughter were for-
feited by that which had taken place. It is said in 2 Redfield on Wills, p. 298, in treating of the
rule as to conditions against disputing the will, that "acceptance of the legacy renders the condition binding upon the legatee, upon the well-known doctrine of election." Election is thus defined by Sir William Grant, Master of the Rolls, in And'ew v. Trinity 1all, 9 Ves. 525, 533: "Where one legatee under a will insists upon something, by which he would deprive another legatee under the same will of the benefit, to which he would be entitled, if the first legatee
permitted the whole will to operate." This thought finds apt illustration in the case at bar.
These legatees insist that the devise of this particular real estate to the plaintiff shall not stand; that it was not the property of the testator, and could not lawfully be devised by him, and therefore that the plaintiff shall not take the property which the testator proposed to give it. If, however, they had accepted this legacy burdened with the condition named, might it not fairly be said that they elected to acquiesce in the will and in the disposition specifically made by the testator of this property? Redfield in the same volume on page 370, after citing .Aorrisonv. Bowman, 29 California, 337, in which this subject was considerably discussed, states as one of the propositions therein established:'
"Although the testator has no legal power to dispose of the property of another, yet if he assumes to do so by his will, -and such person accepts a devise or bequest under the will, it will be a confirmation of such disposition of his own property by the testator."
In Beall v. Schley, 2 Gill, 181, 200, the court said: 4"It is only carrying out a plain intent of the testator, and giving to the residuary devisee that which the testator -intended, and forbidding the heir from taking property not designed for him. From the earliest case on the subject, the rule is, that a man shall not take a benefit under a will, and

at the same time defeat the provisions of the instrument. If he claims an interest under an instrument., he must give full effect to it, so far as he is able to do so. He cannot take what is devised to him, and, at the same time, what is devised to another; although, but for the will, it would be his; hence he is driven to his election to say, which he will take." See also 1 Jarman on Wills, 415 ; 2 Story's Eq. Juris.  1076.
The propositions thus laid down fully commend themselves to our approval. They are good law and good morals. Experience has shown that often after the death of a testator unexpected difficulties arise, technical rules of law are found to have been trespassed upon, contests are commenced wherein not infrequently are brought to light matters of private life that ought never to be made public, and in respect to which the voice of the testator cannot be heard either in explanation or denial, and as a result the manifest intention of the testator is thwarted. It is not strange, in view of this, that testators have desired to secure compliance with their dispositions of property and have sought to incorporate provisions which should operate most powerfully to accomplish that result. And when a testator declares in his will that his several bequests are made upon the condition that the legatees acquiesce in the provisions of his will, the courts wisely hold that no legatee shall without compliance with that condition receive his bounty, or be put in a position to use it in the effort to thwart his expressed purposes.
The decree of the Court of A4peals will be reversed, and the case remanded to that court with instructions to enter a decree in conformity with this opinion.
The CmEF JusTioE did not sit in this case, and took no part in its consideration and judgment.
