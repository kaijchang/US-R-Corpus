Syllabus.

such as that of patents issued by our Land Department is sufficient to overthrow the tradition, fortified as it is by
logic and good sense. Of course, the later decree establishing the will does
not affect the case. That determined only that Kaniu left all her property to Kalakaua, but not that any partic-
ular property belonged to the inheritance. The decree overruling the demurrer of the defendant to the bill of the Kapiolani Estate also is relied upon. But as that case has not passed to a final decree, and the appellant bought the land in controversy pendente lite, it can stand no better than its vendor the party to the suit. Mellen v. Moline Iron Works, 131 U. S. 352, 370 If that case instead of this had been prosecuted to final decree there was nothing in its former action to hinder the Supreme Court from adopting tho principle now laid down, even though it thereby should overrule an interlocutory decision previously reached. King v. West Virginia,216 U. S.92, 100, 101. Other details were mentioned in targument, but nothing more seems to us to need remark.
Decree affirmed.

No. 77. Argued December 5, 1911.-Decided December 18, 1911.
Equitable titles are subject to devise and if not specifically bequeathed, form part of the residuary estate.
One of the objects of a residuary clause is to gather up unremembered, as well as uncertain, rights; and the words "all the rest and residue -of my estate, real, personal-and mixed, which I now possess or which

THE facts are stated in the opinion.

Elliott, 65 S. Car. 251.
An equitable interest as defined in 15 Cyc. 1087, is "such an interest as a court of equity can pursue and appropriate.to the discharge of debts." Certainly this interest does not fall within this definition. As to the law of Maryland where the property is located, see Iglehartv. Armiger, 1 Bland's Chancery, 519, 524.
The estate could not pass. under will. Upington v. Corrigan, 151 N. Y. 143; Church v. Young, 130 N. Car. 8; Goodright v. Forrester, 8 East,, 552, 566; Schulenberg v. Harriman, 21 Wall. 44; Ruch v. Rock Islanid, 97 U. S. 693.
The cases cited in opposition are based on statute and do not apply to this property.
Under Maryland statutory provision the property was

not such as could pass under the will, under the law as in force at the time of Mr. Mayer's death.
There is no presumption in favor of an intention on the part of the testator to. deprive his heir ht law of his real estate. Such an intent must be clear and free from doubt. Rizer'v. Perry, 58 Maryland, 121, 137; Bourke v. Boone, 94 Maryland, 477; Hambletonv. Darrington,36 Maryland, 446;Doe v. Underdown, Willes, 293.
The words used in the agreement regarding a reconveyance are practically a direction to reconvey to the heir, inasmuch as the interest of the testator, before breach, was not assignable. Locke v. Hale, 165 Massachusetts, 20.
To tie'up the property here involved until appellant reaches forty-eight years. of age does violence to the rule of law favoring the early vestinrg of estates. Mercer v. Safe Lieposit Company, 91 Maryland, 114.
Apt words were not used, and the words used did not include this possibility for the reason that "estate" .does not 'include such a possibility. Cole v. Ensor, 3 Maryland, 452.

Mr. Win. F. Mattingly for appellee: The cases where the dbnor conveys directly to the donee
upon condition and cases of mere possibility of reverter have no application to the case at bar, yet if the testator's estate in this property was a contingency coupled with an interest or a possibility coupled with an interest, and it was all that and more, then it was devisable and formed part of the residuary estate. 4 Kent's Comm. 261; Jones v. Roe, 3 Term Rep. 88. See also 2 Williams' SAnuhders, 338k; Doe v. Wqatherby, 11 East, 322; Williams v. Thomas, 12 East, 141; Hayden v Stoughton, 5 !'.k. 528; Clapp v.

erty to him, or, whether it did or not, the entire title would have been in him, and would uiidoubtedly have passed under the residuary clause of the will. See Maryland Code of 1904, § 314.

MR. JUSTICE HoLMEs delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a bill for a conveyance to the plaintiff of a parcel of land to which he claims a right under a trust deed of his father, Theodore J. Mayer. The case was heard on bill and answer, the Supreme Court dismissed the bill, and its decree was affirmed by the Court of Appeals. 33 App. D. C. 391. The facts are these: On February 5, 1907, Mayer conveyed the premises to the Washington Loan and Trust Company and the latter executed a declaration of trust by which it was to convey them to the George Washington University "when and at such times as" the University should comply with certain conditions, by the purchase of certain other specified land, &c. "In the event of the failure of the said University to comply with the terms and conditions of this trust within a reasonable time after the execution of this instrument, which reasonable time is to be determined by the Trustee, when said property, so as aforesaid conveyed to the Trustee, is to be reconveyed to the said Theodore J. Mayer, his heirs and assigns." The word 'when' in the sentence is superfluous, but the meaning is plain. The reasonable time was determined and has elapsed, as is agreed by the University as well as by the Trustee, and the conditions have not been performed, but in March, 1907, before the breach of condition, Mayer died.
Mayer made his will on February 15, 1907, a few days after the trust deed and a month before his death. After pecuniary legacies and a specific devise to the plaintiff of his residence, its contents, etc., he gave the residue of his estate to the American Security and Trust Company

Opinion of the Court.

in trust to make various payments to the plaintiff at different stated times, and upon his attaining the age of fortyeight years to convey all of the trust fund remaining in its hands to the plaintiff in fee. Then followed gifts to the plaintiff's children in the event of his dying before the testator or before reaching the age of forty-eight, and alternative legacies if he left no children surviving him. The question is whether the property covered by the trust deed should be conveyed to the plaintiff now or falls into the. residue to be held upon the trusts created by the will.
The argument for the appellant is that the grantor, Mayer, retained a mere possibility of reverter, which was not devisable, and that if he had more than that still he did not devise it by his will. But the answer is plain. Of course the grantee, the Washington Loan and Trust Company, got the legal title in fee, but by its declaration of trust and its answer it disavowed any beneficial interest, and if the equitable title was in Mayer it was subject to devise by him. But it necessarily was either in Mayer or in the George Washington University, and the courts below were quite right in holding that all rights of the University were subject to a condition precedent that never was fulfilled. The beginning of its rights was to be by conveyance when and at such time as' the University should .have made the required purchase. Or, as stated in another clause not yet quoted, "This declaration of trust is intended to set forth the terms and conditions under which the said Chevy Chase property, or the proceeds thereof, is to be conveyed or given to the said George Washington. University." That it was not given until those terms and conditions were complied with could not be said more plainly. We should add that the University by its answer makes no claim either to the land or to, the profits between the date of the deed and the loss of its rights.
Mayer then at his death had a present equitable right to

the land subject only to be defeated by an event that has not happened, and we see as little ground for doubting that he disposed of it as there is for denying that he had it. The residuary clause is in the usual form, "All the rest and residue of my estate, real, personal and mixed, which I now possess or which may hereafter be acquired by me"; amply sufficient to carry the equitable estate. No doubt Mayer thqught that the Chevy Chase property would go another way, but it manifestly was not certain, and moreover one of the objects of a residuary clause is to gather up unremembered as well as uncertain rights.
Decree affirmed.

VOGT v. GRAFF AND VOGT.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
No. 73. Argued November 17, 1911.-Decided January 9, 1912.
The rule in Shelley's case is a rule of property in the District of Columbia, and the question for this court to determine is not whether it has or has not a legal foundation, or is or is not a useful rule of property, but whether it applies to the case in controversy.
Where the testator directs that on the sale of his real estate the proceeds be divided and paid over to his heirs at once, except the share of a specified heir which shall be paid to trustees to be by them in-' vested, the income thereon to be paid to such heir, the principal to. be paid to his heirs after his death, the application of the rule in Shelley's case would destroy the radical distinctions intended by the testator, and the rule does not-apply.
Notwithstanding the peremptory force of the rule in Shelley's case, where there are explanatory and qualifying expressions showing a clear intention of the testator to the contrary, the rule must yield and the intention prevail. Daniel v. Whartenby, 17 Wall. 639.
A condition of the rule in Shelley's case is that the particular estate and the estate in remainder must be of the same quality, both legal or both equitable, and where the former is equitable and thelatter is legal, the rule does not apply and the two estates do not merge.
Qure: Whether in the case at bar the estate in reilainder is legal or ,equitable.
Quwre: Whether the rule in Shelley's case is applicabli to personal property.
33 App. D. C. 356, affirmed.
TH facts, which involve the construction of a will madeby a resident of the District of Columbia, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. John C. Gittings, with whom Mr. Justin Morrill Chamberlin was on the brief, for appellant:
Until the court below rendered the decision in this

VOGT v. GRAFF.

Argument for Appellant.

case, it was conceded that the "Rule in Shelley's Case" was applicable to personal property in this jurisdiction. Garthv. Baldwin, 1755; 2 Vesey Sr., Ch.Rep. 646. Home v. Lyeth, 4 Harris and Johnson, 435, holds this case was binding authority, and it has ever since been followed in the Maryland courts. See also Warner v. Sprigg, 62 Maryland, 14, and Hughes v. Nicklas, 70 Maryland, 482;. Engle v. Mades, 25 Wash. Laiv Rep. 220; Simms v. Georgetown College, 1 App. D. C. 79, 80.
If the rule has any application to personal property at all, it has the same force and effect as when applied to real estate. If applied by analogy, it must be applied, of course, under the same circumstances and conditions; consequently it is a rule of law and not a rule of construction.
Being a rule of law, it is inflexible and will necessarily
override any-intention of a testator to the contrary in those cases where it is applicable. Home v. Lyeth, supra.
There may-be a class of cases involving executory trusts where courts have not applied the rule. But in the-case at bar, by no possible torture of the testator's language can it be construed to read as an executory trust. Neves v. Scott, 9 How. 211; 2 Underhill on Wills.
A mere direction to convey the legal title or to pay over a fund where the limitations of the trust are complete, does not alone make a trust executory. Rowan v. Chase, 94 U. S. 818; Cushing v. Blake, 30 N. J. Eq. 689, 670; Edgertonv.Lord Brownlaw, 4 H. L. C. 1210. The "Rulein Shelley's Case" must be applied in a court of equity to the same extent as in courts of law, when the trust estate is executed. Preston on Estates, 362; Ferne on Remainders, 157; Bale v. Coleman, 1 P. Williams, 142; Simms v. George-
town College; supra. The very moment we attempt to treat the "Rule in
Shelley's Case" as subservient to a testator's intention, we absolutely efface and obliterate it as a rule of law, and turn it into a mere rule of construction. If this can be

OCTOBER TERM, 1911.

done when the subject-matter is personalty, what analogy is there in its application to real estate? None.
For authority for its decision the court below cites a case long since overruled on every point upon which it. was decided, viz.: Bacon's Appeal, 57 Pa. St. 504, 514. See Grimes v. Shirk, 169 Pa. St. 174, 181; McCannv. Berkley, 204 Pa. St. 214; Shopley v. Diehl, 203 Pa. St. 566, 569.
The rule of construction is that if technical words are used they must be given their primary legal meaning, unless there is something on the face of the will that shows not only that they were not so used by the testator, but will clearly show in what sense they were used. Danielv. Whartenby, 17 Wall. 643; Van Grutten v. Foxwell, reported in Appeal Cases, L. Rept. (1897), 658, 684.
Although the Chief Justice of the court below quotes the rule of construction laid down by this court in Daniel v. Whartenby, supra, he immediately thereafter ignores it.
There are no inconsistent words in that paragraph of the devise in question, and there is a total absence of any qualifying words in that or any other paragraph which shows or tends in any manner to show that the testator used the word "heirs" in the sense of "children."
The word "heirs" may or may not be appropriate; this would entirely depend upon the sense in which the testator used it. From the context'.of the will there is absolutely no ground for a court saying that the word "heirs" was not used by the testator in its primary technical sense.
That the testator was a layman does not appear anywhere in the record, or whether he was learned in the law, as the record is silent upon that point, unless it be the will itself, which shows beyond questiofA that it was prepared. by one skilled in legal lore, and unquestionably knew the legal difference between the words "heirs" and "children."
When we find him using the word "heirs" as a designation of those who were to take the appellant's share after death, it can hardly be said that he meant to use the word

VOGT v. GRAFF.

222 U. S.

Argument for Appellant. ,

"heirs" in any other sense than that in which he had previously used it: that is, its primary legal sense-those who would take real estate if plaintiff should.die intestate.
If the court below is right and the word "heirs" was construed to mean those who would take under the statute of distribution-and for instance, suppose the infant Mathilda should die before her father-the widow of the testator, appellant's mother, would then take appellant's entire share, and his brothers and sister, who were the testator's "heirs," would be entirely cut off. Could this have been the testator's intention? Hardly so. That it was the testator's intention that appellant should have only a life estate in the fund may be perfectly true, but that would not in any manner alter the sense in which the word "heirs" was used.
It might be conceded that in 99 out of 100 cases where the "R ule in Shelley's Case" has been applied to a will, the testator's intention has been that the ancestors should take only a life estate. The inquiry has always been, What was his intention as to the remainder? Did he use the word "heirs" as a word of -limitation? If not, did he use it in some other sense, and if he did, in what sense did he use it? That is the sole inquiry, and for that reason the fact that a testator intended to give the ancestor only a life estate can in nio way throw light upon his intention or show what he meant when using the word "heirs" as' a designation of those who were to take a remainder.
Under the tenth paragraph of the will, the ancestor, appellant, and heirs take the same quality of estates; both are equitable. See Hill on Trustees, 288; Perry on Trusts, § 311; Denton v. Denton, 17 Maryland, 43; Warner v. Sprigg, 62 Maryland, 14; Long v. Long, 62 Maryland, 68; Glover v. Condell, 163 Illinois, 566; see also Garthv. Baldwin, 2 Vesey, 648; Enge v. Mades, 25 Wash. L.

OCTOBER -TERM, 1911.

Opinion of the Court.

222 U. S.

The cases do not sustain the opinion of the court below to the effect that as the trust is expressly limited to the life estate of Fred. H. Vogt, the remainder to the heirs is a legal estate, and hence there can be no union of the two estates under the "Rule in Shelley's Case." Denton v. Denton, 17 Maryland, 407; Owens v. Crow, 62 Maryland, 491, distinguished.
Westcott v. Edmonds, 68 Pa. St. 34; Renzeihauzen v. Kaiser, 48 Pa. St. 351, and Bacon'sAppeal, 57 Pa. St. 505, oited in appellee's brief, were all cases dealing with trusts relating to real property; neither do cases apply which are suits brought by the heirs after the death of the ancestor, claiming that the trust has ceased, as Denton v. Denton; Owens v. Crow, supra;Hooper v. FeIgner,80 Maryland, 262; Long v. Long, 62 Maryland, 33, and Lee v. O'Donnell, 95 Maryland' 538.
Mannerback'sEstate, 133 Pa. St. 342; Mercer v. Hopkins, 88 Maryland, 292, and Mercer v. Safe Deposit Co., 91 Maryland, 102, cited by appellee are not applicable, and do not throw any light upon the case at bar.
To disregard the settled rules of interpretation, sanctioned by 4 succession of ages and by the decisions of the most enlightened judges, under pretext that the reason of the rule no longer exists, or that the rule itself is unrea-, sonable, would not only prostrate the great landmarks of property, but would introduce a latitude of construction boundless in its range and pernicious in its consequence.

VOGT v. GRAFF.

222 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

The defendants in the case, appellees here, were Charles Graff and Frederick C. Gieseking, executors and trustees named in the will, and Matilda S. Vogt, infant daughter of one of the complainants, appellant here, Frederick H. Vogt.
The part of the will to be construed is as follows: "All the rest and residue of my real estate, shall, when my youngest surviving child attains the age of 21 years or one year thereafter in the discretion of my executors, be sold by my executors at public auction after due notice in the news papers of this city. The proceeds of said sales shall be then divided among my heirs, 'share and share alike, and paid over to them respectively at,once, excepting the share coming to my son, Fred H. Yogt. Said share shall be paid to Charles Graff and Frederick C. Gieseking, as trustees, by them invested, the indome therefrom to be paid said Fred H. Vogt, the prindipal to be paid to his heirs after his death." Regarding this provision as a simple composition of English words, we should have no difficulty in deciding that thetestator intended to give to Frederick H. Vogt a life estate in the designated share. But it is contended that the meaning of the testator is determined otherwise by the rule in Shelley's case. The rule is 'thus laid down: "Where the ancestor, by any gift or conveyance, taketh an estate of freehold, and in the same gift or conveyance an estate is limited, either mediately or immediately, to his heirs in fee or in tail, the 'heirs' are words of limitation of the estate and not words of purchase." 1 Co. 104;' Daniel v. Whartenby, 17 Wall. 639, 641; Green v. Green, 23 Wall. 486, 488. It will be observed that under the rule by a technical circumlocution one estate onily is created, though two parts are expressed, a 'particular estate for life with a remainder to the heirs of him who takes the particular estate. The rule, therefore, has been a fruitful source

OCTOBER TERM, 19,11.

Opinion of the Court.

222 U. S.

of controversy. On the one hand it has been praised as having-a substantial foundation and necessarily expressing and enforcing essential legal distinctions in the transfer of property; to be, indeed, the very opposite of a
technical rule and one "established through a long course of decisions extending over a great many generations," and declared therefore to be a rule of substance in order to give effect to the intention of the grantor or testator. On the other hand, it is attacked as off ener defeating intention than executing it, being applied as an absolute and peremptory obligation to convey or devise an estate in fee simple even against an express declaration to the contrary. Invective, therefore, has been employed against it, and even ridicule; and English and American judges, while yielding to it, have pronounced it unjust. We, however, need not enter into the field of controversy. Whether it had a legal and substantial foundation when first pronounced or yet has, whether it is a useful rule of property or part of the debris of an ancient system having now only the mischievous vitality of frustrating the intention of a grantor or testator, we need not consider.
It is conceded to be a rule of property in the District of Columbia, and we are brought to the question whether, consistently with it, the intention which we have seen Vogt has expressed may be executed.
The statement of the rule we have given. There are certain conditions attached to it which give precision to its application. One of these is that the remainder after the particular estate must be to heirs of the whole line of inheritable blood, designating those who are to take from generation to generation. And they must be heirs of him who takes the particular estate, and by devolution from him.
This is important to be observed. The heirs must take from the first taker and not be a description of a class taking from the testator, becoming themselves,

VOGT -v. GRAFF.

222 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

"the root of a new succession." Guthrie's Appeal, 37 Pa. St. 9. Hargrave, in his Law Tracts, states the test to be "whether the party entailing means to build a succession of heirs on the estate of the tenant for life." If he does not, but intends to describe a class taking from him, the rule does not apply. We proceed to illustrate this.
Kemp v. Reinhard, 228 Pa. St. 143, expresses the principle, and its facts bring it into close similarity to the case at bar. In that case the testatrix gave to her son, Jacob E. Kemp, the use and income of seven enumerated properties, "for and during his lifetime." Then followed this clause: "And immediately after the decease of the said Jacob E. Kemp, I give and devise the above-described seven tracts or pieces of land devised to him herein for life to his issue in fee. Should he, however, die without leaving issue living, I give and devise the same unto my son Pierce G. S. Kemp, his heirs and assigns in fee." The court said (p. 147):
"Though the intention of the testatrix may have been to give only a life estate to the appellant, if in the devise there was a limitation of the estate to his heirs to take by devolution from him at his death, her intention is overridden by the rule in Shelley's case; but in every case in which the application of that rule is involved the first question is whether the devisor or grantor intended a limitation of the remainder in fee or in tail as such to the heirs of the first taker, or that there should be the root of a new succession taking directly from the devisor or grantor as purchasers. When the latter intention appears the rule has no place and the intention must be given effect".
And further (p. 147): "'It is very carefully to be noted, that in searching for the intention of the donor or testator, the inquiry is not whether the remainder-men, are the persons who

would have been heirs, had the fee been limited directly
to the ancestor. The thing to be sought for is not the persons who are directed to take the remainder, but the character in which the donor intended they should take. In the very many cases in which the question has arisen, whether the rule was applicable, the difficulty has been in' determining whether the intention was that the remaindermen should take as heirs of the first taker, or originally as the stock of a new inheritance.' Guthrie's Appeal, 37
Pa. 9." Hallv. Gradwohl (1910), 113 Maryland, 293, is also some-
what similar to the case at bar, and we quote the more readily since it is said that the rule in Shelley's case prevails in the District of Columbia because it prevailed in the law of Maryland. After discussing the rule the court said that "it is not a favored" one "in the law of Maryland, although the court will never refuse to apply it in a proper case." And it was decided that where the particular intention of the testator is not to use the words of inheritance in their full legal sense, but "as mere descriptio personarum or a particular designation of individuals who were to take as purchasers at his death," the rule should not prevail. The will passed on made certain bequests and devises and then provided: "The balance of my estate to be equally divided among-my five children or their heirs, share and share alike," with this proviso: "That the portion to which my daughter Sarah Gradwohl may be entitled shall be invested in some safe stocks or other securities, the said Sarah Gradwohl to receive the income from the same during the term of her natural life, and at her death to be equally divided among her children or legal heirs." The court refused to apply the rule. To apply the rule it was said that the words "children or legal heirs" would have to be treated as
words of limitation, that is, as "marking out the extent and duration of her interest." This construction the

VOGT v. GRAFF.

222 U. S.

Opinion of the COQurt.

court rejected as consonant with "neither ruason, policy, justice nor equity," and could only be supported by giving to the words "'legal heirs,' which are superadded to the word 'ehildren,' the arbitrary meaning placed upon them by an artificial rule of law." The court, after an analysis of the will, decided that it-plainly manifested a particular intention-to use those words as mere descriptiopersonarum as a particular-designation of individuals who were to take as purchasers at the death of-the testatrix.
The conclusion of the court was based upon the special provision of the will which directed that the portion given to the testatrix's daughter Sarah should be invested in some safe stocks or securities, and that Sarah should "receive the -income from the same during the term of her
natural life," and should be at her death "equally divided among her children or legal heirs." This language; the
court added, manifested a particular intention on the part of the testatrik "to use the words as mere descriptio personarum. . . In such cases, under all of the authorities, the rule in Shelley's case does not apply."
A like intention is expressed in Vogt's will. His real estate, after satisfying particular devises, is directed to be sold when his youngest surviving child shall attain the age of twenty-one years. The proceeds he directs "shallbe then divided among my heirs, share and share alike, and paid over to them, respectively, at once, except the share coming to my son, Fred H. Vogt. Said share shall be paid to Charles Graff and Frederick C. Gieseking, as trustees, by them invested, the income therefrom tb be paid to said Fred H. Vogt, the principal to be paid to his heirs after his death." If the rule in Shelley's case be applied, it will destroy all of the distinctions -that the testator has expressed. The distinctions are radical, and must be looked to in ascertaining his intention. And this was done, as we have seen, in Hall v. Gradwohl, supra, and it was done, too, we may say, in Kemp v. Reinhard,

supra. The latter case has not the infirmity that counsel for appellant ascribes to some of the earlier Pennsylvania; cases of regarding the rule as one of construction, yielding to and not overriding the intention, as, it is contended, its unflinching and dominating character requires.
The intention of the testator, therefore, may have some sway. We may inquire, at least, as to his intention in the use of the word "heirs," whether as taking from him or as taking from the life tenant. The rule "is silent until the intention of the grantor or devisor is ascertained." Kemp v. Reinhard, supra.
Of Vogt's intention we have no doubt. It is made clearby the distinctions to which we have adverted. To his other children their shares are to be delivered immediately upon the sale of the real estate. To appellant there is nothing of his share to be delivered at all. It is to be delivered to others for him, he to receive, not the body of the share, but only the revenue from it. He is separated from it completely. He does not handle it or direct its investment, and after his death, th3 testator, through trustees he has selected, directs it to be delivered to persons designated by him, or, to use the language of the cases, described by him as taking from him. Opposing reasoning, it is true, might be brought forward, but this court, while asserting and recognizing the peremptory force of the technical terms of the rule, has said: "But if there are explanatory and qualifying expressions, from which it appears that the import of the technical language is contrary to the clear and plain intention of the testator, the former must yield and the latter must prevail." Danielv. Whartenby, supra.
A.. other condition of the application of the rule is that the particular estate and the estate in remainder must be of the same quality, both legal or both equitable. The Court of Appeals decided that such condition did not exist and, on that ground, as well as on that which we have discussed, held adversely to appellant. In other words, the

court decided that the estate given to appellant was equitable and the estate devised to the daughter legal, and that, therefore, the estates did not merge. It is admitted that the estate taken by appellant is equitable; the contentions of the parties turn upon the character of the estate given to his daughter. We will not consider the contentions, nor whether the rule is applicable to personal property. We rest our decision on the ground discussed by us.
Judgment affirmed.

MR. JUSTICE LAMAR delivered the opinion of the court.

Miller, the plaintiff in error, was the attorney of Helmick in an action against Porter. The judgment obtained in that suit was assigned by Helmick to the First National Bank of Fayette, Idaho, which executed an instrument reciting that it would hold any money collected subject to the order of Helmick. At the time of making the assignment Helmick gave verbal instructions to pay part of the money when collected to Lauer. The bank placed the judgment in the hands of Miller, who collected the money, and,. claiming to act as attorney for Helmick, paid over the proceeds to the Moss Mercantile Company, which asserted that the cause of action had been transferred to it prior to the rendition of the judgment. The bank thereupon brought suit against Miller for the recovery of the money thus collected by him and paid over to a third party. The defendant answered, denying that the bank had title; alleging that it had paid no consideration for the transfer; that it was intended to defraud creditors; setting up that Helmick had revoked the assignment and had given Miller a release. There was, however, no claim that the charter of the bank prevented it from taking the transfer or prosecuting the suit.
There were several trials of the case, and ultimately, with the consent of Helmick and Lauer, the bank assigned the judgment to King. He was substituted as plaintiff, and recovered a judgment against Miller. The case was

taken to the Supreme Court, where it was contended that a national bank could not act as trustee of an express
trust so as to be able to institute and maintain a suit under the statute of Oregon, which provides that the trus-
tee of an express trust may sue without joining the person for whose interest the action is prosecuted. The judgment was affirmed, and no Federal question is presented in the writ of error here except on the theory that, under
'Revised Statutes; § 5136, a national bank could not act as trustee of an express trust, and that therefore the suit was absolutely void, and could not pr6ceed to judgment in the name of the substituted plaintiff.
A national bank cannot act as a technical trustee and hold land for the benefit of third persons. It cannot, for example, act as trustee under a railroad mortgage, nor take title to property to be held for the life of the grantor, with remainder to his children. Every such transaction would be voidable at the instance of the Government. Kerfoot v. Farmers'Bank, 218 U. S. 281. But under Revised Statutes, §536, "it may exercise all such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on banking," and it may therefore act as a fiduciary and occupy a trust relation in matters connected with that business. It may do those acts and occupy those relations which are usual or necessaxy in making collections of commercial paper and other evidences of debt. It is both usual and proper for the legal title to negotiable instruments to be vested in a bank by mere endorsement for purposes of collection, holding the proceeds as the endorser directs. There is no difference ia law if the title is conveyed by a lengthier and more formal instrument. In both cases the bank takes the legal title for the purpose of demand and col-
lection. In a proper case, there is no reason why it might not go, further and institute suit thereon in its own name for the recovery of what may be due. If the transfer was made, or the suit was being maintained, for purposes not

Opinion of the Court.

authorized by the charter of the bank, and if the defendant was in a position where his rights were prejudiced thereby, it would be incumbent on him to raise that defense -at the outset of the litigation, or as soon as he learned that fact.
In this case the assignment was made in order that the bank might collect the money, pay part to Lauer, and, in effect, hold the balance on deposit to the credit of Helmick. The judgment was not transferred to the bank for the mere purpose of enabling it to bring suit in its own name. At the time of the transfer no suit was contemplated, and, indeed, none was necessary, because the money was immediately paid by Porter. Suit only became necessary when the amount collected by Miller was later improperly paid over by him to the Moss Mercantile Company. There was nothing in this transaction which was so disconnected with the banking business as to make it in violation of Rev. Stat. § 5136, even if the defendant could raise such question. Kerfoot v. Bank, 218 U. S. 281. The laws of Oregon permitted an action to be maintained by the bank in its own name. There is no Federal question before us which authorizes a reversal, and the judgment is

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT -OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT.
No. 508. Argued April 29, 30, 1912.-Decided May 13, 1912.
In a suit brought by the United States to charge the defendant with a trust in respect to funds-obtained by another through fraud against the United States, held that the personal representative of a third party claiming an interest in the funds under an agreement indemnifying him as bail of the party fraudulently procuring such funds was, under the circumstances of this case, entitled to intervene.
A contract that certain specific assets in the hands of a trustee should be held as security for a specific contingent claim is necessarily express, and is none the less so if conveyed by acts importing it than if stated in words.
Where the intervenor has not legal title and is not claiming against an admitted prior equity as a purchaser without notice, allegations of ignorance of facts not admitted and not finally established are not essential.
Bail no longer is the mundium, and distinctions between bail and suretyship are nearly effaced. Quaere; whether a contract to indemnify bail which is legal by statute in New York where made is void as against the public policy of the United States.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.

Mr. J. T. Coleman, with whom Mr. David McClure and Mr. A. E. Strode were on the brief, for appellant:
An express contract to indemnify a person on his becoming bail for a prisoner charged with crime is not illegal in violation of public policy. United States v. Ryder, 110 U. S. 729, distinguished. That case only holds that where a recognizance in a criminal case is forfeited and paid by the bail, there is no implied contract on the part of the criminal to refund the money to the bail; but it also holds that an express contract to indemnify the bail in such case may be sustained. - In the bill of intervention in this case an express contract was averred. See Simpson v. Robert, 35 Georgia, 183; Rev. Stat., § 1014; United States v. Rundlett, 2 Curtis, 44; United States v. Ewing, 140 U. S. 142; United States v. Horton, Fed. Cas. No. 15,393; United States v. Evans, 2 Fed. Rep. 147; United States v. Case, 8 Blatchf. 250.
In the State of New York, where the contract between Leary and Green was made, a contract to indemnify a bail is not contrary to public policy. Maloney v. Nelson, 144 N. Y. 189; S. C., 158 N. Y. 355.
The public policy of a State, with respect to contracts made within it and sought to be enforced therein, is obligatory upon the Federal courts whether acting in equity or at law. Missouri &c. Trust Co. v. Krumseig, 172 U. S. 351.
Indeed, there is no national public policy. in cases like the one under consideration. Congress has adopted the statutes, and therefore the policy, of the several States in reference to bailing persons charged with crime, and has

assimilated all proceedings in such cases to the usual proceeding in the State in which the person is let to bail.
For one accused of crime to solicit bail is not immoral. For an accused person to offer indemnity to another to become. his bail can hardly be illegal. If a stranger in a strange land could not offer such indemnity, he would, in most cases, have no alternative but to submit to deprivation of his liberty without trial.

Mr. Marion Erwin, Special Assistant to the Attorney General, with whom The Solicitor General was on the brief, for the United States:
The petition is without jurisdictional merit, and the appeal is for delay only.
The property in controversy equitably belonged to the United States, from a time antecedent to when it is claimed that Leary acquired the rights in the property relied upon in the petition; the petitioner failed to plead that such rights had been acquired by a bona fide purchaser.
It appears from the averments of the intervention, that at the time of the alleged agreement of January 20, 1902, relied upon by the petitioner to create an equitable lien in the stocks in controversy, the stocks were and for months had been held by and in the name of Kellogg for the sole benefit of Greene, and that there was no delivery or change of possession, and it was not provided in the agreement that Leary should ever be given possession, but only that
Kellogg should, in the event of Leaxy's being held liable on the bond, apply the stocks to the payment of Leary's debt, and with the right reserved in Greene to withdraw said securities from Kellogg's possession and substitute others in their place. The facts pleaded do not create a ..legal or equitable lien on the stock in favor of Leary or constitute an assignment of the fund even in equity. Christmasv. Russell, 14 Wall. 70; Trist v.

A refusal to grant leave to intervene is not ordinarily considered as finally adjudicating the rights of the parties on the merits. The petitioner may come back with a new petition or ancillary bill, curing defects of pleading and asserting rights not substantially asserted in the former petition.
This case does not fall within the exception to the rule where a third party asserts some right which will be lost in the event that he is not allowed to intervene before the fund is dissipated. Credits Commutation Co. v. United States, 171 U. S. 311.
Petitioner appealed from the order made on the petition as first presented, without attempting to amend or cure the defects, and by so doing waived all right to amend and made the adjudication of her rights in the subject-matter of the petition final. The Three Friends, 166 U. S. 1.
The request to amend here comes too late. Nat. Bank v. Carpenter, 101 U. S. 567.
This court is without jurisdiction to allow the amendments, or to entertain an appeal, for the mere purpose of allowing amendments not offered in the trial court, where neither the pleadings nor evidence in the trial court states a case.
Failure to aver bona fide purchase is fatal. Smith v. Gale, 144 U. S. 519; Coffey v. Greenfield, 62 California, 602; 11 Ency. P1. & Practice, 506; Minot v. Mastin, 37 C. C. A. 238, 95 Fed. Rep. 839.

It is not enough to say that Leary's claim is superior to the Government's claim, for that is a mere conclusion to be drawn or not drawn from the facts well pleaded. Gould v. R. R. Co., 91 U. S. 526.
The failure of an intervenor to make proper averments excusing gross laches apparent on the face of an intervention, as in the case at bar, is fatal. Lansdale v. Smith, 106 U. S. 391; Smith v. Gale, 144 U. S. 509; O'Brien v. Wheelock, 184 U. S. 450; Buel v. F. L. & T. Co., 44 C. C. A. 277; Trust Co. v. Toledo &c., Ry., 82 Fed. Rep. 642.
The contract as one of indemnity for bail was against public policy.
Uncertain and ambiguous averments in pleadings must be construed most strongly against the pleader. The alleged contract of January 20, 1902, must be taken as asserting only an implied contract of a principal to indemnify bail in a criminal case. If so, the suit is fatally defective. Ryder v. United States, 110 U. S. 729, 737; United States v. Simmons, 47 Fed. Rep. 577; Herman v. Jeunchner, 16 Q. B. Div. 561; 3 A. & E. Ency. Law, p. 684; 16 A. & E. Ency. Law, p. 172.
Whatever may be the public policy of particular States as to the administration of the criminal laws, the public policy of the United States as declared by the Federal courts must control in the case at bar.
Prior to the enactment of the "Cash Deposit Law," the public policy of New York was held to be against such indemnification of bail by the principal in a criminal case, but not against indemnification by third parties. People v. -Ingersoll, 14 Abb. Pr. (N. S.) 23, but see New York Code Crim. Proc., § 586.
This legislation changed the public policy of the State, so that a contract of a principal to indemnify bail is no longer against the public policy of the State. Maloney v. Nelson, 158 N. Y. 355.

While it is generally true that the public policy of a State with respect to contracts made within the State and sought to be enforced therein is obligatory on the Federal courts, whether acting in equity or at law, these views are not applicable to cases arising out of interstate commerce, where the policy to be enforced is Federal. Missouri &c. Co. v. Kruning, 172 U. S. 351; United States v. TransMissouri Asso., 166 U. S. 290.
The provisions of § 33 of the Judiciary Act, § 1014, Rev. Stat., relate to bail as known at common law.
This court goes to the common law for definitions of common-law words, especially in matters of criminal procedure, and criminal procedure in the Federal courts is controlled by the common law.

the defendant has no legal effect on Federal cases. United States v. Ryder, 110 U. S. 729.
A change in the public policy of the State of New York as a result of a legislative enactment, which authorizes the principal to contract to indemnify his surety in criminal cases, and destroys the effective safeguards provided by the interested watchfulness of common bail, is in contravention of the public policy of the United States, and the latter must prevail.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.
This is a petition for leave to intervene in a suit brought by the United States to charge the defendant Kellogg with a trust in respect of funds alleged to have been received by him from Greene and to have been obtained from the plaintiff by Greene through his participation in the well known Carter frauds. The funds specially referred to were certain shares of railroad stock standing in Kellogg's name but held in trust for Greene. The nature of the alleged frauds can be gathered from United States v. Carter, 217 U. S.286. See Greene v. Henkel, 183 U. S. 249. The bill of intervention alleges the indictment of Greene and that the plaintiff's deceased became surety upon Greene's bail bond "upon the understanding and condition that the securities held in trust or on deposit" by Kellogg from Greene, being the above mentioned railroad stock, should remain in Kellogg's hands as security and indemnity to Leary for signing, the bond. It goes on to allege Greene's failure to appear, a forfeiture of the bond, a suit upon it brought September 10, 1903, and a judgment for the United States against the intervenor on January 6, 1908. Finally the bill sets forth that the United States not only has got an injunction pendente lite forbidding Kellogg to deliver the fund to the intervenor to be used in partial liquidation of the judgment against her but is pressing the collection of the judgment;

and that the United States has no equity unless subject to that which the intervenor claims.
This suit was begun on December. 19, 1903. The evidence had been taken and it was ready for final hearing when the petition for leave to intervene was filed, April 18, 1908. But the action on the bond seems to have been contested, and no judgment was entered until January 6, 1908, as we have said. The Circuit Court intimated an opinion that the bill of intervention was defective for want of an allegation that Leary, at the time of his agreement, did not know the facts alleged in the principal bill to raise a trust for the Government, and also that, so far as appears, it might be brought upon a supposed implied contract, whereas no such undertaking of indemnity would be implied by the law, citing United States v. Ryder, 110 U. S. 729. But observing that the petition might be amended in these respects, it held that amendment would be unavailing, as the contract was against public policy and void. 163 Fed. Rep. 442. The Circuit Court of Appeals, without deciding upon this last point, affirmed the decree on the above mentioned ground that Leary's knowledge was not negatived, and also on that of laches, apparent and unexplained. 184 Fed. Rep. 433. 107 C. C. A. 27.
The result is that the petitioner is denied her chance to be heard for want of amendments which the court that might hav6 allowed them told her that it was no use to make as it was going to decide against her whatever she did. Even if the court would have allowed them, which is. a speculation, it is holding a party to very technical rules to say that while one case was being dealt with below, he ought to have contemplated having to meet a different one above. But we need not consider that matter, as we are of opinion that the bill, without amendment, showed a sufficient right to intervene.
We lay on one side the suggestion that the intervention goes only upon an implied contract in its proper sense of

LEARY v. UNITED STATES.

224 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

an obligation raised by the law irrespective of any real promise. That would seem to us a perverted interpretation of the words 'upon the understanding and condition' even if the contract were only a general one to indemnify, but a contract that certain specific stock in the hands of a trustee should be held as security for a specific contingent claim could not exist unless it was express. It would be none the less express if it was conveyed by acts importing it than if it was stated in words. The point that Leary's knowledge ought to have been denied impresses us hardly more. The plaintiff has not the legal title and is not claiming against an admitted prior equity as a purchaser without notice. Her position is that she does not know whether the United States has any equity or not, but that whatever rights the United States may have are inferior to hers. She is not called on to allege Leary's ignorance of facts that she does not admit and that are not yet finally established. We are of opinion that any one reading the bill in the same way that he would read an untechnical document would have no doubt that the plaintiff meant to put her case as we have taken it.
The only matters that seem to us to need argument are the questions of public policy and laches. As to the former the ground for declaring the contract invalid rests rather on tradition than on substantial realities of the present day. It is said that the bail contemplated by the Revised Statutes (§ 1014) is common-law bail and that nothing should be done to diminish the interest of the bail in producing the body of his principal. But bail no longer is the mundium, although a trace of the old relation remains in the right to arrest. Rev. Stat., § 1018. The distinction between bail and suretyship is pretty nearly forgotten. The interest to produce the body of the principal in court is impersonal and wholly pecuniary. If, as in this case, the bond was for $40,000, that sum was the

224 U. S.

measure of the interest on anybody's part, and it did not matter to the Government what person ultimately felt the loss so long as it had the obligation it was content to take. The law of New York recognizes the validity of contracts like the one alleged, and without considering whether the law of New York controls we are content to say merely that the New York decisions strike us as founded in good sense. Maloney v. Nelson, 144 N. Y. 182, 189. S. C., 158 N. Y. 351, 355.
As to laches, there is no legal presumption that the petitioner knew of this suit and still less that she knew the position taken by Kellogg. He set up that the stock was taken as indemnity to himself for his promise to indemnify Leary, &c., and said nothing about the petitioner's claim. If that claim is well founded and she knew of this suit, it was not laches in her to assume that Kellogg would do his duty as her trustee. She might be bound
by a decree against him, but before decree on discovering his conduct she fairly may ask a chance to protect herself. Moreover as she disputed liability on the bond she had an additional reason for not moving until the case against her had gone to judgment. See Anonymous, 11 Mod. 2. On the whole matter it seems to us that she was dealt with too technically. She presents a case which unless read with an adverse mind is a good one on its face, and whatever misgivings we may entertain, we are of opinion that she ought to be allowed to try to prove it. In the circumstances it seems to us that the leave to intervene may be granted subject to the condition that the evidence already in shall be taken to be evidence against her subject to her right to recall and cross-examine such witnesses for the Government as she may be advised.

We express no opinion whether to cut this telephone company down to six per cent. by legislation would or would not be confiscatory. But when it is remembered what clear evidence the court requires before it declares legislation otherwise valid void on this ground, and when it is considered how speculative every figure is that we have set down with delusive exactness, we are of opinion that the result is too near the dividing line not to make actual experiment necessary. The Master thought that the probable net income for the year that would suffer the greatest decrease would be 8.60 per cent. on the values estimated by him. The Judge on assumptions to which we have stated our disagreement makes the present earnings 51°/17 per cent. with a reduction by the ordinance to 3'/17 per cent. The whole question is too much in the air for us to feel authorized to let the irijunction stand.

It is the duty of courts to construe wills as they find them, and not to make them. While the doctrine of implication must be resorted to cautiously in the construction of wills, the courts should not hesitate to resort to that doctrine, when thus only can the manifest intention of the testator be carried out.

It is essential to a complete and effectual delivery of an instruiment intended to operate as a present deed, that the grantor should part with all control and dominion over it. If he retains the right to recall the deed, it cannot be considered as delivered. The same principle applies to an escrow. 1 Devlin on Deeds, § 324, p. 578, citing Campbell v.

brought by the respondent, Anderson. The case went three times to the Circuit Court of Appeals, and ended in a judgment for the plaintiff. 146 Fed. Rep. 929; 77 C. C. A. 179. 158 Fed. Rep. 250; 85 C. C. A. 468. 171 Fed. Rep. 785; 96 C. C. A. 445. The facts that need to be stated are these: In 1841 Charles Butler assigned an overdue mortgage of the land to Henry Anderson as security for a note of his own. He made default, Anderson brought a bill to foreclose, (Butler not being served with process), got a decree, bought in, and got the sale confirmed. For the purposes of this decision it may be assumed that Anderson got the land in fee simple, subject to some question as to Butler's rights. The plaintiff below, the respondent here, claimed as remainderman under the will of Henry Anderson, who was his grandfather. The petitioner claims under a conveyance from Butler. If the plaintiff's title is bad that is an end of the case.
In 1846 Henry Anderson, then domiciled in Mississippi, made his will and died, leaving two sons William and James. These sons executed deeds declaring that their father Henry held and intended to hold the land intrust to secure the payment of Butler's note, and Butler subsequently made such payments on the same that itmay
be assumed that unless the plaintiff has a title that his father James could not affect by the above-mentioned
deed, he has none. Whether he has such a title depends on the terms of Henry's will. That instrument, after creating a general trust of substantially all the testator's property, went on thus: "Item. Itismy will that when my son William arrives at the age of twenty-one years the trustees . . . shall deliver to him a settlement of the affairs of the trust, and ifmy debts are then paid, and as
soon as that takes place, they shall put him inpossession of one-half of my property reserving thereout two-fifth parts of said moiety, by valuation which my said trustees shall hold in trust and properly invest and pay over to

MESSENGER v. ANDERSON.

Opinion of ihe Court.

him at the age of twenty-five years

And it is

my will that my said trustees hold and invest and pay over

the remaining moiety of my estate to my son James at

the respective periods of twenty-one and twenty-five

years of age being governed as to the amounts to be

paid at each of the respective periods by the same rules

and directions as are above laid down in the bequest to

William," &c..

If these clauses were all, there would be no doubt that

William and James got an absolute title when they reached

the age mentioned. But a following paragraph reads, "If

either of my sons die without lineal descendants the one

surviving shall take his estate above bequeathed, and if

the survivor die without lineal descendants then" over to

brothers and sisters of the testator. Later in the para-

graph the testator says: "I make the following explana-

tion: The limitations over on the death of my surviving

son without lineal descendants is intended to take effect if

there be no lineal descendants living at the time of the

decease of such son. Nothing: in the foregoing will shall

be construed as to deprive either of mysons of disposing of

their portions by will on their attaining the age of twenty-

one years respectively. The above limitations over shall

give way to the provision of such wills." The testator's

son William died in 1850, unmarried and intestate. The

other son James died in 1902, intestate and leaving the

plaintiff his only child.

The Circuit Court of Appeals when this case first came

up held that James took only a life estate and that the

plaintiff got a remainder that his father could not affect.

case was tried in the state courts between these same

parties concerning other parcels of land in Toledo de-

lower court and affirmed on writ of error by the Supreme

Court of Ohio that James took a fee subject to be defeated

only by his leaving no lineal descendant. Anderson v. United Realty Co., 79 Ohio St. 23. S. C., 222 U. S. 164. The judgment of the lower court was pleaded, but it was held by the Circuit Court of Appeals after the affirmance by the Supreme Court that its own previous decision was the law of the case and that it was not at liberty to reverse the judgment even if the matter was res judicata on the principle laid down in New Orleans v. Citizens' Bank, 167 U. S. 371, 396. See Parrishv. Ferris,2 Black, 606. In the absence of statute the phrase, law of the case, as applied to -the effect of previous orders on the later action of the court rendering them in the same case, merely expresses the practice of courts generally to refuse to reopen what has been decided, not a limit to their power. King v. West Virginia,216 U. S.92, 100. Remington v. Central Pacific R. R. Co., 198 U. S. 95, 99, 100. Great Western Telegraph Co. v. Burnham, 162 U. S. 339, 343. Of course this court, at least, is free when the case comes here. PanamaR. R.R.Co. v. NapierShipping Co., 166 U. S.280. United States v. Denver & Rio GrandeR. R. Co., 191 U. S. 84. In our opinion even apart from the effect of the state judgment as an adjudication it should have been followed, if for no other reason, because at least as against the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals it was right.
The later clauses that we ,have quoted from the will make a difference, it is true, according to whether the sons leave lineal descendants at their death or not. But the interest thus exhibited in descendants is satisfied by the probability that they would inherit the property or be provided for out of it. It is not shown to be so definite and paramount as to cut down the gifts imported by the previous words except in the single event in which the will does so in terms. On the contrary the still later provision that nothing shall be construed to 'deprive' the sons of the power to dispose of 'their portions' by will

indicates that the testator meant the sons to be owners of his estate, subject to the divesting clause.
We should lean toward art agreement with the state courts, especially in a matter like this. In the present instance we see no sufficient reason for refusing to follow their judgment, even if, for any cause not pointed out to us, it did not finally adjudicate the question of title as between these parties in such wise as to be binding upon every court before which that title subsequently might be discussed.

JOHNSON v. WASHINGTON LOAN & TRUST COMPANY.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
No. 40. Argued December 8, 1911.-Decided April 1, 1912.
A will contained the following provision: "It is my will and desire that my said homestead shall be kept and continued as the home and ,residence of my daughters so long as they shall remain single and unmarried. I therefore first after the death of my wife will and devise the said estate to my said daughters being single and unmarried and to the survivor and survivors of them so long as they shall be and remain single and unmarried and on the death or marriage of the last of them then I direct that the said estate shall be sold by my executors and the proceeds thereof be distributed by my said executors among my daughters living at my death and their children and descendants (per,stirpes)."
The testator had three sons and five daughters, all of whom were living when the will was made. The will contained provisions for testator's wife and sons. Four of the daughters married and had children; only one of them married before testator's death, and her children were born subsequently. One daughter remained single and survived all her sisters. Nine years after testator's death, the widow having also died, a decree was entered in a suit in which the daughters alone were parties, directing that the property be sold and proceeds divided among the daughters. In a suit brought subsequently by a purchaser to quiet title against claims of grandchildren of the testator, held that:

JOHNSON v. WASHINGTON L. & T. CO.

224 U. S.

Argument for Appellants.

The provision in the will for the sale of the homestead was for the pro-
tection of testator's daughters, and the words "living at the time of my death" may not be disregarded, and the daughters had a vested remainder in fee not defeasible as to any of them by her death leaving descendants, before the expiration of the preceding estates. Although the clause is elliptical, and the provision for representation is not fully expressed, the court finds from this and other provisions in the will that the intent of the testator is clear, in providing for his daughters and their children and descendants per stirpes, to establish the right of those daughters who survived him as of the time of his death and to provide for the representation of any who might previously die. The purchasers under the decree in the previous suit for sale and division of proceeds, acquired a good title under the decree. 33 App. D. C. 242, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the construction of a will disposing of real estate in the District of Columbia, are stated in the opinion.

Mr. A. S. Worthington for appellants: Appellants contend that by the words-" On the death or marriage of the last of them (testator's five daughters) then I direct that the said estate shall be sold by my executors and the proceeds thereof be distributed by my said executors among my daughters living at my death and their children and descendants" (per stirpes)," testator meant that the proceeds of sale which he directed to be made should be distributed among his daughters and their children and descendants as those classes should exist when all of the daughters should be dead or married. Appellee contends on the other hand that the testator meant that the proceeds of sale should be divided among his daughters and their children or descendants as those classes existed at the time of his death; and that as none of his daughters had any children at that time the daughters took the entire remainder after the termination of the life estate of the widow of the testator.

224 U. S.

Where the intention of a testator is plain, rules of construction are not to be resorted to for the purpose of determining that the testator did not mean what he has said in his will. Clark v. Boorman's Executors, 18 Wall. 502;
Robison v. Female Orphan Asylum, 123 U. S. 702, 707; Travers v. Reinhardt, 205 U. S. 423; Line's Estate, 221 Pa. St. 374; Hood v. Penna.Society, 221 Pa. St. 474, 479.
The language of this will is so plain that no resort is necessary to rules of construction adopted in construing ambiguous devises. Burnside v. Wall, 9 B. Mon. 318.
In this case there was not only a preceding life estate in the widow, but an estate till marriage only in the four daughters who did not remain single. After their marriage no one had a right of possession in Metropolis View except Eliza T. Berry so long as she lived.
Nothing in the will tends to sustain the contention of the appellee as to the proper construction of Item 5th.
There is no rule of law as to the construction of wills which requires the court to overthrow the manifest intention of the testator in this case as to the persons who should share in the distribution which he directed to be made when he should have no living unmarried daughter.
When in a will there is no direct gift of property to the
beneficiaries, but merely a direction that after the termination of a preceding life, or other particular estate, it shall be divided among or paid to certain classes of beneficiaries, in the absence of anything in the instrument to indicate a different intention, only those of the classes described who survive till the time fixed for the distribution will participate therein. O'Brien v. Dougherty, 1 App. D. C. 148; 2 Williams on Executors, 6th Am. ed., 1232.
When the only gift is in a direction to pay at a future time, and the will does not otherwise indicate any intention to make a present gift, the remainder will generally be construed contingent. 1 Jarman on Wills, 6th Am. ed.,

That a remainder is vested on the death of the testator does not necessarily determine that the devisee, his heirs or assigns shall be entitled to the property which is the subject of the gift, since the estate so vested may be divested by the death of the devisee before the determination of the preceding particular estate. 2 Wash. on Real Property, star pages 263, 530; 24 Am. & Eng. Ency. 405; 23 L. R. A. 642, note; 27 L. R. A. (N. S.), 454, note.
Assuiming that the intention of this testator was that the distribution involved was to be made among his daughters and their children and their remote descendants as those classes should exist, not when he died but when the distribution was to take place, it becomes wholly immaterial whether the chance which each daughter had of being in existence when that time came gave her a purely contingent interest, or a vested interest subject to be defeated by her prior death leaving children or other descendants to take her distributive share in her place.

It was held in all that the remainder was contingent, and except in seven cases where it was held that it was vested subject to be divested by the death of the beneficiary before the termination of the preceding estate.

will. Blatchford v. Newberry, 99 Illinois, 11, 57; Coltman v. Moore, 1 McA. 197, do not support appellee's contention in this case.

Mr. B. F. Leighton for appellee: The remainders were vested' Testator's direction for a sale of the property and a division of the proceeds among his daughters living at his death was equivalent to a limitation of the title in fee to them, and they could have -elected, on testator's death, to take the property instead of the proceeds to be derived from its sale.

The legal presumption arising from the making of the will itself is that the testator intended to dispose of all of his property, and not die intestate as to any of it. This presumption must prevail unless overborne by the terms of the will itself. Given v. Hilton, 95 U. S. 591; Snyder v. Baker, 5 Mackey, 455.

MR. JUSTICE HUGHES delivered the opinion of the court.
This is an appeal'from a decree of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, which affirmed a decree in favor of the complainant, The Washington Loan & Trust Company. The suit was brought to quiet title, and the question concerns the construction of the fifth clause of the will of Washington Berry, who died in 1856. This clause relates to the testator's homestead-the property known as Metropolis View, containing about 410 acres, in the District of Columbia-and is as follows:
"Item 5th. It is my will and desire that my said homestead shall be kept and continued as the home and residence of my daughters so long as they shall remain single and unmarried. I therefore first after the death of my wife will and devise the said estate to my said daughters being single and unmarried and to the survivor and survivors of them so long as they shall be and remain single and

unmarried and on the death or marriage of the last of them then I direct that the said estate shall be sold by my executors and the proceeds thereof be distributed by my said executors among my daughters living at my death and their children and descendants (per stirpes) and I hereby reserve to my heirs the family vault and burial ground embracing half an acre of ground and having the
said vault as a centre and on such sale as aforesaid by my executors I earnestly enjoin on my sons or some of these sons to purchase the said homestead that it may be kept in the family."
The will was executed in 1852. The testator had three sons and five daughters, all of whom were living at that time; and they, with his wife, survived him. Four of the daughters married and had children; only one of them was married before the testator's death and her children were born subsequently. One daughter, Eliza Thomas Berry, remained single and survived all her sisters, dying in 1903. The testator appointed his wife and one of his sons executors and trustees; the widow acted as executrix, but the son declined.
Soon after the death of the testator, the widow removed from the homestead and neither she nor any of'her unmarried daughters occupied it again. During the war the
estate suffered much injury; the vault was destroyed and it was necessary to remove the bodies it had contained; the rent and profits were not sufficient to pay taxes or to provide for repairs and the property fell into a dihe.pidated condition.
The testator's widow died in 1864. In the following year a suit was brought by three of the married daughters and their husbands in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia to have the property sold and the proceeds divided among the daughters-save the proceeds of the burial ground and vault, which the bill asked to have distributed among the heirs at law. The other children

of the testator, with the spouses of those that were married, were parties defendant. There were, then living, three grandchildren-by the daughters-but they were not parties or represented. All the defendants, save one married daughter-who was a minor and answered by guardian, submitting her rights to the court-consented to the decree. Eliza Thomas Berry, the unmarried daughter, stated in her answer that she relinquished "upon the sale of the estate in the bill mentioned her right to the possession and enjoyment thereof whilst unmarried," and consented "to the distribution of the proceeds of sale as prayed." The case was referred to the auditor fo take testimony and report whether the sale would be for the advantage of the infant defendant. He reported that the property was an unfit residence for the unmarried daughter; that the land generally was poor and unproductive as a farm; that the testator had used it as a mere place of residence, and it was fit only, as a whole, for a man of fortune; that the burial place had been demolished and the buildings and fences were out of repair; and that it was a fit case for a sale.
In October, 1865, the court entered a decree for sale, appointing for that purpose two trustees, who were authorized to divide the estate and to sell it in parcels if this were found advisable. The division was made accordingly, and certain lots were sold at public auction. Subsequently, upon the petition of two of the daughters and their husbands, stating that they had children to support and were in need of the maoney that would come from the sale, the court ordered the trustees to sell the residue of the estate, and sales were made at public auction, which were confirmed by the court in October, 1868, and the proceeds were distributed among the five .daughters of the testator. In the long period of years since that time the property has been divided into many separate parcels, which have been the subject of convey-

ances, it being assumed that a valid title passed under the court's decree.
In 1906, suit was brought in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia by the children of the daughters of the testator against the children of the deceased sons, averring that on the death of the unmarried daughter, Eliza T. Berry, in 1903, the entire equitable interest in the property vested in fee simple in the complainants; that their rights and interests had not been affected by the decree in the former suit or by the sales that had been made under it. It was prayed that trustees might be appointed in the place of those named in the testator's will, to whom the legal title should be transferred. Decree was passed and trustees were appointed by the court on February 20, 1907.
Thereupon Henry P. Sanders brought this suit against all the parties in the suit above mentioned-including the trustees-to quiet the title to a portion of the land which he had derived-, by mesne conveyances, through the sale made under the decree passed in 1868; and he alleged that he, and those under whom he claimed, had been for thirty-five years in exclusive and continuous possession, relying upon the validity of their title acquired bona fide for a valuable consideration. Mr. Sanders died in 1907, appointing The Washington Loan & Trust Company executor and trustee of his last will and testament by which the real property in question was devised, and an order was made substituting this company as complainant.
It is contended by the appellants that, under the provision of the fifth item of the will, the proceeds of the sale, which the testator directed to be made of the property, should be distributed "among his daughters and their children and descendants as those classes should exist when all of the daughters should be dead or married." The appellee insists that, at the death of the testator, the

daughters took a vested remainder in fee, "to take effect in possession on the marriage of all of them, or the death of the last unmaxried daughter."
On examining the scheme of the will, we find that the testator made separate provision for his three sons on the one hand, and for his five daughters on the other. While he contemplated the marriage of his children, and the birth of issue, he did not seek to tie up his property for the benefit of his children's descendants. The testator made no provision whatever for grandchildren or for the descendants of his children save as it was made in the clause in question and in the residuary clause.
To each of his sons he devised a tract of land. The devise was to the son, his heirs and assigns. In the case
of two of the sons, it was made on condition that the son and his heirs should convey to the testator's daughters the son's interest in certain real estate, and in case the conveyance were not made within two years, the devise was not to take effect and the property was to go to his daughters living at his death, share and share alike. There was a slight difference in the wording of the conditional devises to the daughters; in the one, they were described as "my daughters living," and in the other as "my daughters living at my death." After thus providing
for the sons in the first three items of the will, the testator adds that he annexes to their several estates "this limitation that if either of them shall die without leaving lawful issue that the estate of each one or both if more than ofe shall go to the survivor or survivors, his and their heirs."
We have no occasion to consider the effect of this provision upon the devises to the sons, but it may be noted that there was no gift to the children or descendants of the sons, nor did the testator undertake in case all the sons died without leaving issue to devise the property to the children or descendants of his daughters.
By the fourth item of the will, the testator gave to his

JOHNSON v. WASHINGTON L. & T, CO.

224 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

wife for life, in case she survived him, the homestead
estate-the property here in question-together with certain money and securities subject to the maintenance and
education of his five daughters, while unmarried, and to the provision that each daughter, on marriage and birth of issue, should receive one-sixth part of the personal property bequeathed. When the condition was satisfied by birth of issue, the daughter took her share absolutely. Then followed the fifth clause above quoted, under which
this controversy has arisen. And to this was added the residuary clause-item sixth-providing as follows: "I direct that my executors shall divide and distribute all
the rest residue and remainder of my personal estate among my children at my death and the descendants of such as may have died during my life to take a parent's
part." In the disposition of the homestead, the testator ex-
plicitly states his purpose. He was planning for the protection of his daughters. He desired the property to be the home of his widow so long as she lived and that after her death it should continue to be the home of his daughters while they remained unmarried. When this object had
been attained, the property was to be sold and the pro-
ceeds divided. These avails were to be distributed "among my
daughters living at my death and their children and descendants (per stirpes)." The'words "living at my death" may not be disregarded. They are not to be eliminated in the interest of a construction which would leave the clause as though it read, "among my daughters who shall be living at the time of the death or marriage of my last unmarried daughter and the children and descendants
(per stirpes) of such of my daughters as may have previously died." At the time of the death of the testator, his five daughters were living, and none of them had children or descendants. By the definitive language of the

clause, these daughters were then ascertained and identified as those entitled to the immediate enjoyment of the property on the termination of the preceding estates. They, therefore, had a vestedremainder in fee. Croxall v. Shererd, 5 Wall. 268, 288; Doe v. Considine, 6 Wall. 458, 474-477; Cropley v. Cooper, 19 Wall. 167, 174; McArthur V. Scott, 113 U. S. 340, 380; Hallifax v. Wilson, 16 Ves. 171: The fact that the property was directed to be sold and that they were described as distributees of the proceeds did not postpone the vesting of the interest. "For many reasons," said this court by Mr. Justice Gray in McArthur v. Scott, supra (pp. 378, 380), "not the least of which are that testators usually have in mind the actual enjoyment rather than the technical ownership of their property, and that sound policy as well as practical convenience requires that titles should be vested at the earliest period, it has long been a settled rule of construction in the courts of England and America that estates, legal or equitable, given by will, should always be regarded as vesting immediately, unless the testator has by very clear words manifested an intention that they should be contingent upon a future event. . . . Words directing land to be conveyed to or divided among remaindermen after the termination of a particular estate are always presumed, unless clearly controlled, by other provisions of the will, to relate to the beginning of enjoyment by the remaindermen, and not to the Vesting of the title in them. So a direction that personal property shall be divided at the expiration of an estate for life creates a vested interest." In Cropley v. Cooper, supra,the testator bequeathed the rent of his house to his daughter for her life, and it was provided that at her decease the property should "be sold, and the avails therefrom become the property of her children or child, when he, she, or they have arrived at the age of twenty-one years, the interest in the meantime to be applied to their maintenance." When the testator

died, his daughter, who survived him, had one son about three years old. It was held that the son took a vested interest at the death of the testator. The court said (p. 174): "A bequest in the form of a direction to pay at a future period vests in interest immediately if the payment be postponed for the convenience of the estate or to let in some other interest. . . . In all such cases it is presumed that the testator postponed the time of enjoyment by the ultimate legatee for the purpose of the prior devise or bequest. A devise of lands to be sold after the termination of a life estate given by the will, the proceeds to be distributed thereafter to certain persons, is a bequest to those persons and vests at the death of the testator."
The question remains, whether the interest vested in the daughters was defeasible on condition subsequent. That is, whether on the death of a daughter-befoe the determination of the preceding estates-leaving descendants, her interest was to be divested and her descendants were to take by substitution.
What, then, was the intent of the testator in providing for the children and descendants of daughters per stirpes? If the clause be considered to import a condition subsequent, providing for a divesting of the interest of the daughters who survived him and a substitution of their children and descendants, it would necessarily follow that the children and descendants of daughters who died before him would be excluded from participation. It is difficult to suppose that this was his purpose. That his daughters might marry and die, leaving children, before he died, was undoubtedly contemplated. At the time of his death, one of his daughters had already married. If she survived him, she was to have a share in the property. Did the testator intend that if she died after his death, and before the time for distribution, her interest was to be divested in favor of her children and descendants, and if she died before the testator her children and descendants were

to be barred? Or, if it had happened that three of the daughters had married and died during the testator's lifetime, leaving children, and another daughter had married and died after the testator, were the children of the latter daughter to share in the avails of the property, on the death of the last daughter, unmarried, to the exclusion of all the other daughters' children? It is not to be thought that the testator designed such a purely arbitrary selection unless the words forbid a different interpretation.
The language of the clause is not of this imperative character. As well might it be said that it required the conclusion that the daughters and their respective children and descendants were to take concurrently. But this would not be a sensible construction, and it would seem. to be equally contrary to the intention of the testator to imply a condition subsequent and thus not only to make defeasible the interest which passed to the daughters, but to shut out the children and descendants of daughters who predeceased him.
The clause is obviously elliptical, and the provision for representation is not fully expressed. Taking the context and the entire plan of the will into consideration, we believe that what the testator had in mind was to establish the right of his daughters, who survived him, as of the time of his death, and to provide for the representation of any of his daughters, who might previously die, by her children and descendants. So construed, the disposition is a natural one and representation of the same sort is accorded as that provided for in the next paragraph when, in giving to his children the residuary personal estate, the testator fully defined the representation intended by stating that "the descendants of such as may have died during my life" were "to take a parent's part."
We are of the opinion that the remainder in fee which vested in the daughters, all of whom survived the testator, was. not defeasible as to any of them by her death, leaving

descendants, before the expiration of the preceding estates. As already stated, all the daughters were parties to the suit brought in 1865; and all consented to the decree, save the married daughter who was under age and whose interests were duly protected by the court. It follows that the purchasers under the decree acquired a good title.
The complainant was entitled to the relief sought. Decree affirmed.
