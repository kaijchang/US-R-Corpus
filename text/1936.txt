MR. JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.

Decedent was an honorably discharged volunteer soldier of the Civil War. In 1904, he was allowed a pension. October 19, 1924, having made application and signed an agreement in accordance with the Act of June 25, 1910,' he was enrolled as a member and admitted to the Danville branch of the National Home for Disabled Vol-
unteer Soldiers, and continued to be an inmate until he .died, September 16, 1926. During that period the United States paid his pension, in instalments of $72 per month, to the treasurer of the branch. He died intestate, leaving as his sole heir at law, a son over 21 years old. Respondent brought this action to recover $1546.47 of his pension money remaining in the hands of the treasurer after deductions as to which no question has been raised. The District Court gave judgment for that amount with interest and costs. 9 F. Supp. 403. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed except as to costs.' 81 F. (2d) 963. That decision, being in conflict with one of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, Durack v. National Home, 44 F. (2d) 516, this court granted a writ of certiorari.
Petitioners raise a single question. They maintain that, since the decedent did not leave a widow, minor child or dependent mother or father, the accumulated pension fund became payable at his death to the post fund of the Danville branch. If the Act of July 1, 1902,3 governs, the balance belongs to the post fund. If, as held below, the Act of 1910 and the agreement made in
'36 Stat. 736. 24 U. S. C., § 136. ' The Circuit Court of Appeals held: Although governmental agen-
cies are named defendants, the suit is in fact one against the United States; § 5, Act of July 3, 1930, 46 Stat. 1017, 38 U. S. C., § lid, permits allowance of interest against the United States, but costs should not have been allowed.

accordance with it control, the administrator is entitled to recover.
Section 2 of the Act of February 26, 1881, provides: "All pensions payable . . . under this act, to pensioners who are inmates of the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers shall be paid to the treasurer . .. of said home . .. to be disbursed for the benefit of the pensioners. . . Any balance of the pension which may remain at the date of the pensioner's discharge shall be
paid over to him; and in case of his death at the home, the same shall be paid to the widow, or children or, in default of either, to his legal representatives."
Applicable to the pension money held by the branch were rules and regulations declaring: A pensioner, not classed as incompetent, may direct that all or any portion of his pension money be sent to his wife, minor child or dependent relative; the governor of a branch may prevent hurtful, wasteful or extravagant use of the pension money by retaining a sufficient amount until the danger has passed; pension money standing to the credit of a member sick in hospital will be paid directly to him in such amounts only as are necessary. for his personal use; in the case of members classed as incompetent, payment of pension money may be made as follows: (a) to the surgeon in such sums as may be

It was applicable only to pensions paid out of the money so appropriated. The Act of AuguSt 7, 1882, 22 Stat. 322, provided: "That all pensions and arrears of pensions payable or to be paid to pen, sioners who are or may become inmates of the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers shall be paid to the treasurers of said home, to be applied by such treasurers as provided by law, under the rules and regulations of said home. . . .

necessary for the personal expenses of the member (b) to a wife, minor child or dependent relative upon the authority of the president of the board of managers (c) to pay taxes, etc., when necessary to protect the interests
of the member.' The Act of July 1, 1902, provides: "Hereafter any balance of pension money due a mem-
ber of the National Home . . . at the time of his death shall be paid to his widow, minor children or dependent mother or father in the order named, and should" none "be discovered within one year from the time of the death . . . said balance shall be paid to the post fund of the Branch-. . . of which the pensioner was a member
at the time of his death ... subject to future reclamation by the relatives hereinbefore designated, upon application filed . . . within five years after the pensioner's death." 6
Petitioners maintain, and for the purposes of this decision we assume without deciding, that the Act of 1902 relates to pension money paid to the treasurer of a national home for the use and benefit of a member and held by him at the time of the member's death. But it contains nqthing that relates to use or disposition of the fund while the pensioner is alive. It relates exclusively

The pensions of all who . . . are . . . inmates of the Home . . . shall be paid to the treasurer of the Home. The money thus derived shall not become a part of the funds of the Home, but shall be held by the treasurer in trust for the pensioner . . . and such part of it as shall not sooner have been paid to him shall be paid to him on his discharge from the institution. . . .

to disposition of the balance in the hands of the treasurer at the time of death. In that respect alone, it conflicts with and supersedes the corresponding provisions of the -Act of 1881.
The scope and effect of the Act of June 25, 1910, remain to be considered. It provides:
"Hereafter the application of any person for membership in the National Home . . . and the admission of the applicant thereunder shall be and constitute a valid and binding contract between such applicant and the Board of Managers of said home that on the death of said applicant while a member . . . leaving no heirs at law nor next of kin, all personal property owned by said applicant at the time of his death, including money or choses in action held by him and not disposed of by will, whether such property be the proceeds of pensions or otherwise derived, shall vest in and become the property of said Board . . . for the sole use and benefit of the post fund of said home . . . and that all personal property of said applicant shall, upon his death, while a member, at once pass to and vest in said Board . . . subject to be reclaimed by any legatee or person entitled to take the same by inheritance at any time within five years after the death of such member. . ....
Before that enactment, it was disclosed that in the National Home a substantial number of inmates died intestate and without heirs, leaving not only the balance of their pension money remaining in the hands of the branch treasurer but also money on deposit in banks. The Act directs the disposition of personal property left by members dying intestate and without heirs. Congress intended to vest in the board of managers for the post
fund only that which, for lack of testamentary disposition and heirs at law, would be liable to escheat to the State. Whether the Act extends to the balance of decedent's pension money accumulated in the hands of the branch

treasurer depends upon the meaning to be given to the words "all personal property owned by said applicant at the time of his death, including money or choses in action held by him and not disposed of by will, whether such property be the proceeds of pensions or otherwise derived." The words "all personal property" are broad enough to include his beneficial interest in the trust fund created by payments of his pension to the treasurer. The words "including money or choses in action" obviously do not exclude that money. There is nothing to suggest that the phrase "whether such property be the proceeds of pensions or otherwise derived" was intended to eliminate the pension money. It indicates purpose to extend not tt restrict. Even if "proceeds of pensions" might be held to refer to something other than pension money, that meaning would have no tendency to exclude funds in the hands of the treasurer. The measure leaves the member free to dispose by will and safeguards to the legatees and heirs the right within five years to reclaim "all the property" that belonged to him at the time of his death. As to that, there is no ambiguity and therefore nothing to construe. To the extent that, in respect of disposition of the pension money in the hands of the treasurer at the time of the member's death, the Act of 1910 is inconsistent with the Act of 1902, the latter is superseded. It follows that respondent is entitled.to the fund in question. -

Syllabus.
PUFAIL, RECEIVER, v. ESTATE OF ELVIRA J. PARKS, DECEASED.
CERTIORARI TO THE APPELLATE COURT, FIRST DISTRICTY OF ILLINOIS.
No. 18. Argued October 15, 1936.-Dccidcd December 7, 1936.
1. Section 66, Title 12, U. S. C., declaqres that a person holding stock in a national banking association as executor shall not be personally subject to any liability as stockholder, but that the estate and funds in his hands shall be liable in like manner and to the same extent as the testator would be if living and. competent to act and hold the stock in his own name. Held that the purpose of the latter clause is to make plain that, although the executor is exonerated personally, the estate is not; but the statute evinces no intent to prefer the assessments of stockholders' liability over other claims against the estate, or to exempt the receiver of the bank, in the collection of assessments, from pursuing the remedy prescribed by the local law for the collection of like claims. P. 222.
2. Section 64, Title 12, U. S. C., imposes no lien for the amount of an assessment against a living stockholder, and § 66 imposes none against the estate of a deceased stockholder. P..224.
3. The statute creates an unsecured and unpreferred claim against a decedent's estate. Where the assessment has been made in the decedent's lifetime, an accrued and provable debt exists against his estate; if made after his .death, a claim against the funds and assets of the estate accrues as of the date of assessment. P. 224.
4. The receiver of the bank may enforce his claim based on the assessment only in conformity to the law of the forum governing recovery of debts of like nature. If he elect to proceed in a federal court, the judgment or decree will determine the validity and amount of the claim; but if payment is desired from assets under the control of a state probate court, the marshalling of the claim with others, its priority, if any, in distibution, and all similar questions, are for the probate court upon presentation to it of the judgment or decree of the federal court. P. 225.
5. If the receiver prosecute his claim in a state court, the litigation will be governed (at least in the absence of federal legislation to the contrary) by the common and statutory law of the State. P. 226.

6. If the State does not discriminate against the receiver's claim, in favor of others of equal dignity and like character, there is no warrant for exempting the claim from the effect of local statutes governing procedure or limiting the time for prosecution of action. P. 227.
7. By the law of ,Illinois, claims against a decedent's estate, not exhibited to the court within one year from the granting of letters, are barred as to property and estate of the deceased which has been inventoried or accounted for by the executor or administrator, and claims may not be p.rved while they remain contingent; but opportunity is allowed to collect claims not presented within the year from assets subsequently discovered, whether the failure to present them earlier was due to negligence or to their contingent character; and if the claim is contingent, and the liability of the estate does not become absolute until after the expiration of the year, the creditor may recover from the distributees to the extent of the assets received by them respectively. Held that a claim of a national bank's receiver against a decedent's estate, based upon an assessment of shares, was not entitled to satisfaction out of assets 'inventoried within one year after the granting of letters testamentary, where the insolvency of the bank, the levying of the assessment and the presentation of the claim to the Illinois probate court, all occurred after that year had expired. P. 227.
283 Ill. ApLe. 95, affirmed.
CERTIORARI, 298 U. S. 649, to review a judgment affirming the rejection, by the Probate Court and by the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois; of a claim by the receiver of a national bank. The judgment here under review was not reviewable by the Supreme Court of Illinois, for want of a "certificate of importance."

Mr. George P. Barse, with whom Mr. Otis F. Glenn
was on the brief, for petitioner. The estate remained liable after the stockholder's death.
The contingent assessment liability became absolute when the assessment was levied. The estate was then still in process of administration and undistributed, inventoried assets of value far in excess of the assessment claim were and are in the hands of the executors. R.*S.,

PUFAHL v. ESTATE OF PARKS.

Argument for Petitioner.

§ 5152, 12 U. S. C. 66, expressly provides that the estates and funds in the hands of persons holding stock as executors shall be liable for stock assessment in like manner and to the same extent as the testator would be, if living and competent to act and hold the stock in his own name. This provision shows a clear intent on the part of Congress that the liability, as limited and defined by § 66, shall extend to the estate of a deceased shareholder for the benefit of the creditors of an insolvent national bank. The fiduciaries are exempt, but the property belonging to the estate in their hands is liable, as would be the deceased, if living.
This obligation of the estate continues unimpaired until valid assignment of the shares by final distribution of the estate. Farrestv. Jack, 294 U. 'S. 158, 162; Seabury v. Green, 294 U. S.165, 169. See also Matteson v. Dent, 176 U. S.521, 524; Richmond v. Irons, 121 U. S.27, 55, 56; Zimmerman v. Carpenter,84 Fed. 747, 751; Drain v. Stough, 61 F. (2d) 668, 669.
The non-claim statute of Illinois, providing that claims of any class not exhibited to the court within one year from the granting of letters of administration shall be forever barred from sharing in the distribution of the inventoried assets, does not relieve the estate and the undistributed inventoried assets in the hands of the executors from the obligation and liability for stock assessment imposed by the federal law.
The estate being still open and in process of administration, with an excess of undistributed, inventoried assets in the hands of the executors, Forrestv. Jack, supra, is distinguishable. The federal act specifically ana directly imposes the liability on the undistributed assets.
See Zimmerman v. Carpenter,84 Fed. 747 (cited with approval by this Court in Forrest v. Jack, supra, and Seabury v. Green, supra); Drain v. Stough, 61 F. (2d) 668; Below, Receiver, v. FirstNational Bank of Danville,

The contingent assessment liability was an equitable
lien upon the estate. The laws of the States will not be permitted to dis-
criminate against or interfere with the operative effect of the national banking laws. Mortimer v. Potter, 213 Ill. 178; Kingston v. Old National Bank, 359 Ill. 192.
A claim which is not only contingent, but which, from its very nature, is incapable of being presented earlier in pending probate proceedings, cannot reasonably be considered to be within the scope and purpose of a non-claim statute. See Hantzch v. Massolt, 62 Minn. 361; M1cter & Lux v. Katz, 10 Cal. App. 576; Springhorn v. Dirks, 72 Mont. 121; Zimmerman v., Carpenter, 84 Fed. 747, 750751; Allen v.

From the standpoint of enforcing the assessment liability imposed by the federal statute, it is obvious that the problem created by the expiration of the period for filing claims under the non-claim statute is not adequately or reasonably met by the fact that, under the state law, the .receiver may possibly be able to satisfy the assessment out of property subsequently discovered and inventoried or, in the alternative, may proceed against the heirs, devisees, legatees, or distributees receiving the inventoried property from the estate.
As far back as Kennedy v. Gibson, 8 Wall. 498, this Court has recognized the plain purpose of the National Bank Act to wind up insolvent national banks speedily.

217

Opinion of the Court.

Mr. Franz W. Catle, with whom Messrs. Emmctt J. McCarthy and Robert F. Carey were on the brief, for respondent.

MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.

In this case we are concerned with the bearing of state law upon the enforcement of an assessment against the
estate of a stockholder of a national bank. Elvira J. Parks died March 20, 1928, owning twelve
shares of the capital stock of the Austin National Bank of Chicago. May 17, 1928, the Probate Court of Cook County, Illinois, granted letters testamentary to the executors named in her will, who filed an inventory and supplemental inventory in the probate court within one year of the date of the letters. March 30, 1931, the Comptroller of the Currency declared the bank insolvent, closed it, and appointed the petitioner receiver, and May 21, 1931, assessed all stockholders, including the executors of Elvira J. Parks, one hundred per cent. of the par value of their stock. The executors refused to honor the receiver's demand for payment, and on September 1, 1933, he filed his claim in the Probate Court for $1,327.17, the amount of the assessment with interest to the date of filing. January 13, 1934, the court disallowed the claim. The receiver appealed to the Circuit Court, where the case was tried de novo. That court, applying a state statute, disallowed the claim as against undistributed assets in the hands of executors inventoried within one year from the date of the grant of letters, because the claim did not accrue and was not presented to the Probate Court within that period, but allowed it as to assets not inventoried within the year. (From a stipulation filed in this court it appears that there are in the executors' possession inventoried assets in excess of the amount of petitioner's claim; that the estate is solvent; and that

there are no assets not inventoried within one year from the granting of the letters, or discovered after the expi ration of that period.) The Appellate Court of the First District of Illinois affirmed the judgment. A certificate of importance, requisite for a review by the Supreme Court of the State, was refused. Certiorari was granted to resolve a conflict respecting the construction of relevant federal statutes.
U. S. C. Tit. 12, § 64 is in part: "The stockholders of every national banking associa-
tion shall be held individually responsible for all contracts, debts, and engagements of such association, each to the amount of his stock therein, at the par value thereof, in addition to the amount invested in such stock ..
Section 66 is: "Persons holding stock as executors, administrators, guardians, or trustees, shall not be personally subject to any liabilities as stockholders; but the estates and funds in their hands shall be liable in like manner and to the same extent as the testator, intestate, ward, or person interested in such trust funds would be, if living and competent to act and hold the stock in his own name." The petitioner asserts these sections give his claim a quality so superior to that of other contingent claims against a decedent's estate that it must be recognized by state tribunals without regard to limitations upon allowance imposed by state laws. The liability is imposed by the statute.' The original subscriber and likewise an immediate or remote vendee of the shares assumes a status,-that of stockholder. The assumption of this status involves whatever conditions or burdens the federal statutes have imposed as incident to the holding of national bank shares. The contingent

Opinion of the Court.

obligation to pay an assessment is rendered absolute by the Comptroller's action in ordering one; whether that action be taken during the stockholder's life or after his death. From the moment of the Comptroller's order for assessment the bank's receiver has a claim which would support an action of debt at common law against a living stockholder, or the executor of a deceased stockholder. And if assessment be made after the estate of a deceased stockholder has been distributed the receiver may proceed to recover the amount from distributees or heirs, if, and to the exteht, they areliable for debts of the estate under the law of the domicile
The first clause of § 66 obviously was intended to exempt from personal liability the executor, administrator, guardian or trustee who holds stock as such fiduciary whether standing of record in his name or in that of the decedent, ward, or settlor. The second declares that the estate and funds in the hands of an executor shall be liable as the testator would have been if living, competent, and a stockholder of record. The question is whether this clause adds anything to the obligation of the decedent which is cast upon his estate by operation of law irrespective of § 66.1 Does it impose upon the estate a liability differing from that which the law fastens upon the personal representative to discharge out of the estate, debts accruing before or after the decedent's death? We think that, as the first clause exonerates the fiduciary from personal liability, the second negatives the inference that the exoneration is to-extend to the decedent's estate. -This was the view taken by Judge Shipman in Davis y. Weed, 7 Fed. Cas. 186 (44 Conn. 569):
"I do not think that section 5152 [§ 66] was intended to affect the liability for assessments of estates in process

of settlement. The principal object of the section was to prevent a personal liability from running against ex-
ecutors, administrators, trustees or guardians, who had purchased as trustees, or to whom had been transferred in their names as trustees national bank stocks for the
benefit of the trust estates. Having by such purchase voluntarily entered into a contingent liability for assessinents, it might be claimed that a judgment de bonis pro-
priis could be rendered against them. The main object of the section was to prevent personal judgments being rendered against such persons in whom the stock stood on the books of the bank as trustees."
The statute evidences no intent to prefer the assessment over other claims against the estate, or to exempt the receiver from the pursuit of the remedy prescribed by the local law for collection of claims of the same sort.
Section 64 gives the receiver 'no lien for the amount of the assessment against the property of a living stockholder. The claim may only be recovered by suit or action. The judgment obtained is collectible like any other; it has no preference in distribution if the debtor's property be in the hands of a receiver, if he has made an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or become bankrupt. Section 66 makes a deceased stockholder's estate liable in like manner, and to the same extent, as he would have been if living. As no lien is created against the property of a living stockholder by § 64, § 66 imposes none against his estate.4
The statute creates an unsecured and unpreferred claim against a decedent's estate. Where the assessment has

'In Witters v. Sowles, 32 Fed. 130, 140, and in Drain v. Stough,
61 F. (2d) 668 there are statements that the statute imposes a lien on estate assets. In Rankin v. Miller, 207 Fed. 602, 611 one ground of decision was that such a lien existed. So in Drake v. Dilatush, 16 F. Supp. 120, the District. Court for Eastern Illinois by decree imposed a lien upon the assets of a decedent's estate held by the executor, under circumstances like those presented in the instant case.

been made in the decedent's lifetime an accrued and provable debt exists against his estate; if made after his
death a claim against the funds and assets of the estate
accrues as of the date of assessment. Although the petitioner's demand is based upon a fed-
eral statute, he may enforce it only in conformity to the law of the forum governing the recovery of debts of like nature. He might have sued in a federal court. Not-
withstanding the statute providing that the citizenship
of a national bank, for purposes of federal jurisdiction, shall be as if it were a corporation of the state where it has its place of business, the receiver is an officer of the
United States and, as such, entitled to sue for assessments in a federal court, irrespective of the citizenship of the parties or the amount in controversy.' If he elect so to do, R. S.721 (28 U. S. C. § 725) governs the trial:
"The laws of the several States, except where the Con-
stitution, treaties, or statutes of the United States other-
wise require or provide, shall be regarded as rules of decision in trials at common law, in the courts of the United States, in cases where they apply."
In such a proceeding the state statute of limitations will be applied; ' and it seems that the local substantive law governing property rights in stock will be observed.7 Nor does the principle that the jurisdiction of courts of the United States cannot be defeated by a state's laws limiting redress of its own citizens to certain 'tribunals 8

create such inconsistency or conflict as to require the overriding of the law of the state with respect to distribution
of the estate of a decedent. Where, as here, a res has
come into the possession and under the control of a state court, one having a right to go into the federal court, either by reason of diversity of citizenship, or because he is a federal officer, cannot obtain a judgment or decree entitling him to interfere with the administration of the res by the court having its possession. While he may not be denied his right to prosecute an action to judgment or a suit to final decree in the federal court, such judgment or decree can do no more than adjudicate th3 validity and amount of his claim. The marshalling of that claim with others, its priority, if any, in distribution, and all similar questions, are for the probate court upon presentation to it of the judgment or decree of the federal
court.' Thus, though a receiver should resort to the United States District Court, he would need to present, in a probate court, any judgment obtained, if he desired payment from the assets under the control of the latter.
The receiver may, as petitioner elected to do, prosecute his claim in a state court. If he does, at least in the absence of Congressional declaration to the contrary, the litigation will be governed by the common and statutory law of the state. Thus the local statute of limitations applies; 10 and the local law as to the extinguishment of
the estate and the liability vel non of distributees controls.1
If the state law requires a claim for an assessment to be prosecuted in an action of debt, the receiver cannot elect to bring some other form of action or to sue in equity;

conversely, if the law prescribes a suit in equity, the receiver cannot bring an action at law. And if under the state statutes demands against a decedent's estate must be proved in a probate court, the receiver cannot pursue some other form of action. This is not to say that a state may deny all remedy for the substantive right arising out of the federal statute (see Seabury v. Green, supra); it is merely to say that if the state does not discriminate against the receiver's claim in favor of others of equal dignity and like character, there is no warrant for exempting the claim from the effect of local statutes governing procedure or limiting the time for prosecution of action.'

is § 70 of the Illinois Administra-

"Sixth. All other debts and demands of whatever kind without regard to quality or dignity, which shall be exhibited to the court within one year from granting of letters as aforesaid.
"All claims and demands of whatever class not exhibited to the court within one year 1 from the granting of letters as aforesaid shall be forever barred as to property and estate of the deceased which has been inventoried or accounted for by the executor or administrator; and if the executor or administrator shall thereafter file any inventory listing other estate not previously inventoried or

In Illinois a creditor whose claim against a decedent's
estate is not due may present it for allowance and settlement provided the liability of the decedent was absolute. 4 Contingent claims may not be proved. 5 Section 70 is not a general statute of limitations but a specific provision intended to facilitate the early settlement of estates. 6 It results that a claim not presented within the year,
though not entitled to be paid from assets inventoried within the year, is not barred, but may be collected out

of assets subsequently discovered; and this is so whether the failure timely to present the claim was due to the creditor's negligence, or to the fact that the claim was contingent in character and did not become absolute by the happening of the contingency during the year. 7 If the claim is contingent, and the liability of the estate does not become-absolute until after the expiration of the year, the creditor may recover from the distributees to the extent of the assets received by them respectively. 8
The claimant has only to present and prosecute his demand in the probate court, which has jurisdiction both of legal demands and those cognizable in equity." While, therefore, the creditor need not resort to a court of law or equity to establish his claim, he may do so, since the jurisdiction of those courts over such claims has not been abolished."

forum- in which he prosecutes his demand, no execution is issued upon the judgment or decree obtained.
Whether the claim is presented to the probate court or litigated in some other, within the year, the judgment is
that the claim be paid "in due course of administra-

upon a demand, presented to the probate court or prose-
cuted at law or in equity after the expiration of the year, the judgment is special, that the claim be paid out of assets inventoried or discovered after the lapse of the year, like the common law judgment quando acciderint;4 or that it be enforced against distributees.25 The only bar to the recovery of such a judgment is the general statute of limitations.8
A creditor cannot subject inventoried assets, undistributed and held by the administrator, to the payment

to have his demands paid out of undistributed inventoried assets.2"
It is apparent that the decision under review enforces the policy of the state evidenced by § 70 of the Adminis-
tration Act as it has been uniformly applied to claims of like character.
The petitioner relies on Mortimer v. Potter, 213 Ill. 178; 72 N. E. 817, but it is not in point. The claim of
the receiver for an assessment in that case accrued after
the estate had been fully administered and while the
stock with respect to which assessment was levied was in the hands of trustee to whom it was devised by the
testator. Under the principles of Illinois law, as has
been shown, such a devisee who received assets from the decedent's estate is liable for the assessment to the extent of those assets.
The petitioner also cites Zimmerman v. Carpenter,84 Fed. 747, as authority in his favor. In that case a circuit court of the United States entered a decree charging the assets in the hands of an executor with the amount of an assessment levied after the decedent's death. It is not clear from the opinion whether the court thought that § 66 creates a lien on estate assets from the date of the bank's failure or construed the section as creating a claim sui generis enforceable directly against assets in the possession of the executor and under the control of a state court of competent jurisdiction. As we have shown above, either theory is wrong.

Strauss v. Phillips, 189 Ill. 9, 23; 59 N. E. 560; compare Blanchard v. Williamson, 70 Ill. 647. The petitioner cites cases to the effect that probate courts in Illinois act upon equitable principles. Some of these are collected in Note 13, supra, but they go only to the point that in probating claims against an estate those courts recognize equitable doctrines, and do not remit a creditor to a court of
equity if his claim is equitable rather than legal. No statute or case has been found indicating that these tribunals have independent equity jurisdiction.

3. Under the Massachusetts succession tax law (§ 2, supra), succession to property through the failure of an intestate to exercise a power of appointment under a non-testamentary conveyance of the property by deed of trust, made after September 1, 1907, is not taxed; whereas if the conveyance was made before that date, the succession isnot only taxable but the rate of tax may be greatly increased by aggregating the value of that succession with other interests derived by the transferee by inheritance from the donee of the power. Held repugnant to the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. P. 288.
4. Under the Massachusetts succession tax law (§ 2, supra), where property passes to a lineal descendant as remainderman under his ancestor's will through the failure of a deceased life tenant to exercise a power of appointment, the property is treated as coming from the donee of the power if the bequest antedated September 1, 1907; otherwise, as coming from the testator; with the result that, in the one case, the rate of tax being graduated, the tax may be increased by aggregating with the bequest the value of other interests inherited by the same beneficiary from the donee of the power, whereas, in the other case there is not such aggregation and increase.

OCTOBER TERM, 1936.

Opinion of the Court.

299 U. S.

MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.

This appeal is from an order denying abatement of succession taxes assessed in respect of the estate of Hetty S. L. Cunningham, late a resident of Brookline, Massachusetts. Mrs. Cunningham died intestate in August, 1931, leaving as her sole heirs four children, who, with the trustees and certain beneficiaries of three trusts wherein she had life estates, were the petitidners below and are the appellants here. She left a substantial estate of her own which descended to her four children. Their succession to this estate was taxed, the tax was paid, and its legality is not questioned. Pursuant to the terms of the three trusts, her four children, succeeded, upon her' death, to the ownership and possession of certain property whereof she had been life tenant with power of appointment of principal; and succeeded to the enjoyment as life beneficiaries of other property as to. which she had preceded them as-life tenant. The appellee held the succession to the trust property taxable, and added the value of the corpus of Mrs. Cunningham's own estate and that of the interests to which the appellants succeeded upon her death, with the result that the trust interests took a higher rate. The taxes assessed upon, the three trust interests were paid, and a petition was file4 in the probate court for abatement in the view that the exaction was forbidden by Article I, § 10, and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. The probate court reserved the questions, the Supreme Judicial Court decided them adversely to appellants,' and upon its rescript the petition was denied.
In 1877 Mrs. Cunningham (then Hetty Sullivan Lawrence) conveyed property in trust reserving a life estate in the income but no power to revoke, alter or amend.
A1\iss. Adv. Sheets, 1936, p. 153; 199 N. E. 528.

BINNEY v. LONG.

280

Opinion of the Court.

The income was to be paid for twenty years after her death "to and among such of" her children as "may be
living at the time of payment," living issue of a deceased child to take by rightof representation. If, at her death,
or at any time during the twenty years thereafter', no
child or issue of hers should be living the trustees were to transfer the principal to the heirs of her father, if he were then dead; otherwise, to her own heirs. She married and had five children, one of whon born in 1S92, died in 1923, without issue. The others, born between 1885 and 1890, are appellants.
In 1862 Amos A. Lawrence, the intestate's father, paid a sum of money to an insurance company which agreed to pay the income to the intestate and, upon her death, to distribute the principal and any unpaid income, to such persons as she might, by will, appoint, and in default of appointment, to her surviving children.
Sarah E. Lawrence, the intestate's mother, died May 27, 1891. Her will bequeathed property in trust to pay the-income to each of her six children, two of whom still survive, and to the issue, per stirpes, of any deceased child so long as any of her children should live. For twenty years after the death of the last survivor of her children the income was to be paid to her grandchildren and their issue, per stirpes, and, at the expiration of that period, the principal was to be divided between the grandchildren, per capita, descendants of a deceased grandchild to divide his or her share per stirpes. Each child of Sarah E. Lawrence was empowered to "appoint the shares in which" the income given to his or her children and issue "shall be apportioned among such children and issue" and further to appoint the proportions in which the principal "shall be divided among such children and issue." Under this provision the four children of Mrs. Cunningham, who are appellants, succeeded to equal life estates in their mother's share, she having failed to exercise her power.

OCTOBER TERM, 1936.

Opinion of the Court.

299 U. S.

When the trusts were created Massachusetts imposed no inheritance or succession tax. The first statute im-
posing such a tax 2 applied only to collateral inheritance and excluded devolution to lineal descendants. In 1907 a law was enacted taxing testamentary devolution of property to lineal descendants; this made no mention of powers of appointment; the tax was graduated according to amounts and relationships, but there was no requirement of aggregation of various interests passing and accruing to a single beneficiary from or on account of the death of a decedent to ascertain the rate of tax. Such a provision for uniting interests was enacted in 1924; and incorporated with the first section of the act of 1907 as amended into a jingle section.5
The act of 1907 and its amendments were prospective in operation .and exempted estates of those who had died prior to its effective date.' This exemption has extended to all interests which passed or accrued upon the death of Sarah E. Lawrence, the intestate's mother.
In 1909 provision was made for a succession tax upon the occasion of the exercise of, or nonexercise of, powers of appointment.! This, in its present form, is § 2 of chapter 65 of the General Laws.' The effective date of this provision was declared to be September 1, 1907, which was the effective date of the 1907 act, and was twentyone months prior to the effective date of the 1909 act in which the provision is embodied. It is conceded that there are no other statutes purporting to tax succession under nontestamentary gifts.

280

Opinion of the Court.

The acts are compiled in the General Laws of the Commonwealth, and, so far as material to the present controversy, are:
General Laws (Ter. ed.) c. 65: "Section 1. All property within the jurisdiction of the commonwealth, corporeal or incorporeal, and any interest therein, belonging to inhabitants of the commonwealth S. . , which shall pass by will, or by laws regulating intestate succession, or by deed, grant or gift, except in cases of a bona fide purchase for full consideration in money or money's worth, made in contemplation of the death of the grantor or donor or made or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment after his death . . . to any person, absolutely or in trust . . . shall be subject to a tax at the percentage rates fixed by the following table: [A table of graduated rates here appears.] "Provided, however, that no property or interest therein, which shall pass or accrue to or for the use of a person in Class A, except a grandchild of the deceased, unless its value exceeds ten thousand dollars, and no other property or interest therein, unless its value exceeds one thousand dollars, shall be subject to the tax imposed by this chapter, and no tax shall be exacted upon any property or interest so pas~ing or accruing which shall ;duce the value of such property or interest below said amounts. "All property and interests therein which shall pass from a decedent to the same beneficiary by any one or more of the methods hereinbefore specified and all beneficial interests which shall accrue in the manner hereinbefore provided to such beneficiary on account of the death of such decedent shall be united and treated as a single interest for the purpose of determining the tax hereunder. "Section 2. Whenever any person shall exercise a power of appointment, derived from any disposition of prop7 erty made prior to September first, nineteen hundred and

seven, such appointment when made shall be deemed a disposition of property by the person exercising such power, taxable under section one, in the same manner as Ihough the property to which such appointment relates belonged absolutely to the donee of such power, and had been bequeathed or devised by the donee by will; and whenever any person possessing such a power of appointment so derived shall omit or fail to exercise the same within the time provided therefor, in whole or in part,
a disposition of property taxable under section one shall be deemed to take place to the extent of such omission or failure in the same manner as though the persons thereby becoming entitled to the possession or enjoyment of the property to which such power related had succeeded thereto by a will of the donee of the power failing to exercise such power, taking effect at the time of such omission or failure."

"Section 36. This chapter shall apply only to property
or interests therein passing or accruing upon the death of persons dying on or after May fourth, nineteen hundred and twenty, and as to all property and interests therein passing or accruing upon the death of persons who have died prior to said date the laws theretofore applicable shall remain in force; but so much of this chapter as relates to property or interests therein passing
by deed, grant or gift completed inter vivos in contemplation of death shall apply only to such deeds, grants or gifts made on or after May twenty-seventh, nineteen hundred and twenty."

THE 1877 TRUST.
The trust created by the intestate in 1877, by deed inter vivos, reserved no power of revocation or alteration and, in this respect, differed from that under consideration in Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, 276 U. S. 260. The appel-

BINNEY v. LONG.

280

Opinion of the Court.

lants insist that the invalidity of § 1, supra, as applied to their succession is established by Coolidge v. Long, 282 U. S. 582, since to tax them would under the doctrine of that case impair the obligation of the intestate's contract, and deprive them of property without due process. The court below thought that case not controlling because, there, the remainders were vested from the date of the gift, whereas, here, the interests of appellants were executory or, at the best, contingent remainders which never vested until the intestate's death. In Coolidge v.
Long this court concluded that the tax laid by the act of 1907 offended the contract and due process clauses of the Federal Constitution because the interests of the remaindermen had vested at the date of the creation of the trust many years prior to the passage of the taxing act. It was held that the mere taking possession of that which had been vested in the beneficiaries for many years did not amount to a taxable occasion and constitutionally could not be so designated by the Commonwealth in view of the complete vesting of the beneficiaries' estates in remainder at the date of the execution of the deed.
The Supreme Judicial Court, following an unbroken line of authority in Massachusetts, and in accordance with the common law ' and the law as declared by this court '"holds that the appellants' estates, under the trust instrument of 1877, were, at most, contingent remainders which did not vest until after the intestate's death, and hence the transfers to them fell clearly within the statutory definition as made to take effect in possession or enjoyment after the donor's death. The appellants urge that, in imposing a succession tax, the state should disregard technical rules relating to the vesting of interests and look to the substance; and they insist that for many

years prior to 1907 those who were to take in succession to the intestate were ascertained, subject only to the contingency that, as in Coolidge v. Long, some of them might fall out of the class by death. The contention was made and rejected in Coolidge v. Long. The fact that the remainders were vested from the date of the deed, and the interests of those who took in remainder were merely subject to be defeated by a condition subsequent, was the basis for the conclusion that the tax could not constitutionally be laid upon the occasion of their acquiring physical possession of what had, in the eye of the law, long been their property. Having 1elied on legal rather than practical considerations to invalidate the tax in Coolidge v. Long, it would be inconsistent here to rely on practical rather than legal considerations to invalidate the same tax. The Commonwealth was not. prevented by the constitutional provisions which the appellants invoke from taxing the succession under the 1877 trust upon the occasion of the intestate's death since the appellants' estates. never vested until that event.
As Mrs. Cunningham's death was the occasion for a tax upon the succession of those who take in remainder after her life estate, we can conceive of no constitutional objection to the statutory provisions for uniting the interest thus derived with that which the appellants acquired in Mrs. Cunningham's own property at, her death, and calculating the rate on the total according to a sliding scale.
THE 1862 TRUST.
The act of 1907, (§ 1, supra) does not purport.to tax complete and irrevocable transfers inter vivos, not in contemplation of the donor's death, made subsequermt to the effective date of the act. The 1862 contract was not made in contemplation of the grantor's death; it lecame effective when executed. Such a transfer made to-day would result in no tax upon the interest acquired by the

life tenant or. upon those interests resulting from her exercise or non-exercise of her power of appointment. By the act of 1909, however, (§ 2, supra) the legislature, while not.attempting to tax the interests of the appellants as derived in succession to Amos A. Lawrence, does essay to tax those interests as derived from the intestate as the holder of a power of appointment under Amos A. Lawrence's contract. But the statutes do not tax similar interests the enjoyment of which depends upon the exercise or nonexercise of a power embodied in a deed effective after September 1, 1907. The law, therefore, creates two classes,-the one composed of beneficiaries who take at the death of the donee of a power created by an instrument antedating 1907, who are taxed,-and the other of beneficiaries who take in succession to the donee of a power conferred by a deed executed subsequent to 1907, who are not taxed. Upon its face the statute arbitrarily selects a past date, taxing the beneficiaries of an act if done prior to, and leaving untaxed beneficiaries of a precisely similar act if done subsequent to that date. In justification of the discrimination the court below suggests that any change in the state's policy of taxation must take effect at some point of time. The truth of this statement is obvious, but the appellants' complaint is not directed at the fact that inheritances occurring prior to the effective date of the act of 1907 have escaped taxation while those happening thereafter are subjected to the exaction. The claim that the statutes deny equal protection is based upon quite another sort of discrimination. Succession consequent upon testamentary gifts (that is those made by will, or in contemplation of death or to take effect in possession or-enjoyment after death) made or to take effect after the date of the act is the subject of the excise. The succession to non-testamentary gifts made subsequent to the effective date of the act of 1907 is not taxed whether the

person coming into ownership and enjoyment of property does so by virtue of the direct gift of the former owner or by virtue of the exercise or non-exercise of a power of appointment vested by the former owner in a third party. Thus the future policy of the Commonwealth is declared to be that those who benefit by a testamentary gift are to be taxed while those who benefit, either immediately or remotely, from a complete and irrevocable gift inter vivos are not to be taxed. On the other hand, the statutes declare that one who benefits remotely through the exercise or non-exercise of a power under an absolute gift long since completed is to bear the burden of the exaction. This is not the declaration of a new policy effective after the promulgation of the legislation. On the contrary the statutes declare the policy to be the exemption for the future of a wellknown type of succession, while at the same time imposing a tax on the identical. type if resulting from a past gift.
Neither the appellee nor the Supreme Judicial Court advances any satisfactory reason for this difference in treatment of persons similarly circumstanced.
The Supreme Judicial Court states: "The legislative intent possibly was to tax succession under St. 1907, c. 563, not as from the donee but from the donor of the power. Whatever the reason, the classification cannot be pronounced arbitrary or unreasonable. The tax operates equally and uniformly as to all within this class. It may fairly have been deemed by the General Court to be founded in the 'purposes and policy of taxation.'" Instead of assigning any reason for the discrimination the statement merely points out that two classes are created, those who are taxed and those who are not, and since all who are taxed are treated alike and all who are
exempt are treated alike the statute is uniform in opera-

tion upon each class; and thus falls short of meeting the question for decision.
As we have noted, the only basis for the classification is the time when the estate was created. - This court has said that a tax on gifts inter vivos, so laid as to hit those
made within a given period prior to the donor's death and exempting all others, would be wholly arbitrary. Schlesinger v. Wisconsin, 270 U. S. 230. And we have also said that a discrimination in the taxation of loans based solely upon the time when the loan was made would clearly' be arbitrary and capricious. Colgate v. Harvey, 296 U. S. 404, 425.
It is said that prior to the passage of the act of 1909,
succession derived through a power granted by an instrument effective before September 1, 1907, escaped taxation although the interest of the beneficiary really had its origin subsequent to that date; and thereby the Commonwealth unfairly lost taxes which were its due, and discrimination resulted between beneficiaries under trusts created before and after September 1, 1907. The argument, however, overlooks the fact that a transfer through
a power created after September 1, 1907, is, notwithstanding the act of 1909, still wholly untaxed where, as in the case of the trust under consideration, the power is to be exercised by a third party and the gift is not made in contemplation of the settlor's death. We fail to see how fairness, either to the Commonwealth or its citizens, is promoted by taxing the appellants, the beneficiaries of a trust made many years before the succession tax laws were adopted, while exempting beneficiaries similarly situated in all respects save only that the trust was created after September 1, 1907. The discrimination becomes the more glaring when it is remembered that the tax is increased by the aggregation of the interest passing to the beneficiaries under the 1862 contract with that which they derive by inheritance from the intestate. Thus, a

beneficiary taking through a power under an inter vivos non-testamentary trust, created after September 1, 1907, would not have to. aggregate the interest so derived with property inherited from the donee of the power, whereas one taking, as do the appellants, under a power in a deed executed in 1862 is compelled, by aggregation of the interests, to pay at a much higher rate on the property derived through the power.
In view of the hostile discrimination against a class of remaindermen arbitrarily singled out for taxation from all those similarly situated, we are bound to hold the statutes deny the equal protection of the laws in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment.

THE 1891 TRUST.
In their operation upon the trust created in 1891 by the will of Sarah E. Lawrence, the statutes discriminate between the appellants and others similarly situated. The discrimination differs in kind from that exhibited in the case of the 1862 trust, but is equally hostile and arbitrary.
When Mrs. Lawrence died in 1891, the interests created in her lineal descendants were wholly exempt from taxation. When, in 1907, the Commonwealth adopted a policy of taxing succession by lineals, the statute said nothing of powers of appointment. Nevertheless, under that act, had it been in force when Mrs. Lawrence 'died, the intestate, her daughter, would have paid a tax upon the value of the life estate given her by her mother's will, and the appellants when they came into possession of remainder interests, upon the intestate's death, would likewise have been compelled to pay a tax upon their succession to Mrs. Lawrence's estate. The act of 1909 (§ 2, supra) recognizing that the act of 1907 (§ 1, supra) does not apply to the succession generated at the death of Mrs. Lawrence, nevertheless pitches upon the fact that under her will the intestate had a power of appointment and

BINNEY v. LONG.

280

Opinion of the Court.

makes the takers of ,Mrs. Lawrence's property in succession to the intestate liable for a tax as if the property had descended from the intestate. As directed by § 1 the appellee aggregated the interest falling to the appellants under their grandmother's will with that coming to them from their mother under the intestate law. Thus, the interest derived under the 1891 trust is taxed in the higher brackets at four per cent. whereas had it been created by a will effective after September 1, 1907, the tax would be computed as upon a succession to Mrs. Lawrence's estate alone, and at a rate of one per cent.
The same considerations which have been stated in respect of the 1862 trust are controlling as to this one. We think it an arbitrary and unreasonable discrimination that the beneficiary of a power must aggregate the interest so derived with that enjoyed by inheritance of property owned in fee by the donee of the power, if the instrument
creating the power antedates 1907, but need not so aggregate the interests for the purpose of taxation if the creation of the power be subsequent to 1907. The consequence that the one must pay at a higher rate on the interest falling in at the death of the donee of the power than the other who takes by reason of an exactly similar event, denies the equal protection of the law to the
former. The argument that the act of 1909 tends to render'
collection of taxes more certain by accelerating the time of payment and making the executors the collectors of the tax is answered by the provisions of § 7 of c. 65 of the General Laws (Ter. ed.). Remaindermen become liable for the tax, not at the death of the donor, but. when they come into possession and enjoyment of the property at the expiration of a le.. estate or term of years. The tax on their succession is then payable by any fiduciary who then holds the property, and, if none is in office, by the beneficiaries themselves. It cannot

therefore successfully be contended that the act of 1909 was adopted with a view to earlier or more certain collection of the tax.
The Commonwealth seeks to support the statutes upon well known principles: that the guaranty of equal protection does not compel adoption of an iron rule of equal taxation, preclude variety in taxation, or forbid classification of subjects if the discrimination is founded upon a reasonable distinction or if any state of facts reasonably can be conceived to sustain it; and that where the evident purpose is to deal fairly and equitably in classifying the subjects of taxation, a statute will not be condemned-because of minor and incidental hardships or inequalities due not to a hostile purpose but to inherent difficulties or inadvertence. The claim is that the discrimination against the appellants is justified by either or both of these principles. While this court always accords great weight to the judgment of a state legislature, we cannot agree that there is here a fair basis for difference of treatment. All that is said in defense of the statute is that it treats alike all those who take under instruments executed prior to an arbitrary past date, and treats alike all those who take under instruments made subsequently to the same arbitrary date, and that the legislature may have found some reason for the discrimination in the state's policy of taxation. But this is merely to say that arbitrary classification which is the result of the exercise of the legislative will must be sustained. The alternative and inconsistent contention that the discrimination is the result of inadvertence, cannot prevail. The act of 1907 was prospective in its operation. Knowing that that act did not reach successions under deeds or wills effective prior to September 1, 1907, the legislature adopted the acts of 1909 and 1924 to put those who succeeded to remainder interests created prior to September 1, .1907, into a taxable class while

leaving wholly exempt or taxing on a different basis and at a different rate remaindermen taking under instruments effective subsequent to September 1, 1907. To suggest that this was an attempt to bring about equality which failed through inadvertence is to be blind to the obvious purpose and intent of the legislature. Action could not have been more deliberate.
The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

MR. JUSTICE CARDOzo, dissenting in part.

I am unable to concur in so much of the opinion of the court'as invalidates the tax upon the interests passing to ,the appellants under the deed of 1862 and reduces the amount of the tax under the will of 1891.
On September 1, 1907, the Commonwealth of Massa-
chusetts laid a tax upon the subject of any transfer to take effect in possession or enjoyment after the death of a donor, whether the succession was brought about by will or intestacy or gift inter vivos. Acts 1907, c. 563. This court held in Coolidge v. Long, 282 U. S. 582, that as to remainders already vested, but dependent upon an estate for life, the tax so imposed is a denial of due process,
though the life estate did not end until after the passage of the statute. In 1909 the legislature of the Commonwealth enacted another statute providing in substance that .where the transfer becomes complete through the exercise or non-exercise of a power of appointment. (cf. Saltonstallv. Saltonstall, 276 U. S.260, 270, 271; Guaranty Trust Co. v. Blodgett, 287 U. S.509, 511) the succession shall be deemed to have been derived from the donee of the power, if the power had its origin in a disposition of property made before September 1, 1907, and

if made after that date, from the donor of the power. Acts 1909, c. 527, § 8: G. L. (Tercentenary Ed.) c. 65, § 2.
Is the result of that amendment an unlawful discrimination when applied to the deed of 1862 and the exercise
or non-exercise of the power there created? If succession must be treated as derived from the donor,
irrespective of the date when the power was created, many
interests will go free that in fairness should contribute their quota to the fisc. "Whatever be the technical source of title of a grantee under a power of appointment, it cannot be denied that in reality and substance it is the execution of the power that gives to the grantee the property passing under it." Matter of Dows, 167 N. Y. 227, 231; 60 N. E. 439; aff'd sub nom. Orr v. Gilman, 183 U. S. 278, 287; Matter of Delano, 176 N. Y. 486; 68 N. E. 871; aff'd sub nom. Chanlerv. Kelsey, 205 U. S. 466, 478. This court has held that a legislature does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment by giving heed to these realities when taxing a succession. Orr v. Gilman, supra; Chanler v. Kelsey, supra. The cases that have been cited had their
origin in New York. For a time the tax laws of Massachusetts were drawn along stricter lines. Emmons v. Shaw, 171 Mass. 410, 413; 50 N. E. 1033. Until the Act
of 1909, a transfer through a power, if made under an instrument effective before September, 1907, escaped taxation altogether, though the gift in substance and ,reality may have had its origin thereafter. Acts 1907, c. 563, § 25; cf. Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, supra; also Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, 256 Mass. 519, 522, 525; 153 N. E. 4. This was unfair to the Commonwealth. It was perhaps unfair to legatees who were taxable under gifts of later date. But the evil, however patent, was not subject to correction through the medium of a uniform rule taxing the succession under every power of appointment exercised thereafter, and taxing it as deriyed from the primary donor. Such a method of assessment would be adequate in its application to instruments to be executed in the

BINNEY v. LONG.

280

CAfwozo, J., dissenting.

future, but quite inadequate as to instruments executed in the past. There was need for a distinction based on
difference in time. One may take for illustration a will made in 1914,
seven years after the Act of 1907, and another made in 1900, seven years before. Each, let it be assumed, provides for a life estate, with power to the life tenant to appoint the remainder, and with a gift over to children in default of an appointment. The life tenants die in 1921. If an assessment is made upon the right of succession under the will of later date, there will be no difficulty in collecting the tax, economically and swiftly, out of the estate of the donor. The power having been created after 1907, the executors will be under a duty to retain so much of the estate as may be necessary to pay the tax in full. But in respect of the 1900 will, the situation is very different. The probability is that before the adoption of the statute the executors under that instrument will have been given their discharge. In that event the probate court will no longer have control of the estate, and the Commonwealth will be left to a precarious remedy against remaindermen deriving their possession through the non-exercise of the power, if perchance the failure to exercise it becomes known at all. Estates of subsequent donors will thus be made to bear the burden while those of earlier donors are left substantially im-
mune. The amendment of 1909 corrects that inequality. Has it substituted another to be condemned as more
offensive? The rule is elementary that a state in adopting a sys-
tem of taxation is not confined to a formula of rigid uniformity. Swiss Oil Co. v. Shanks, 273 U. S. 407, 413. It may tax some kinds of property at one rate, and others
at another, and exempt others altogether. Bell's Gap R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, 134 U. S. 232; Stebbins v. Riley,

particular kind of business, and exempt some other kind of business closely akin thereto. Quong Wing v. Kirkendall, 223 U. S. 59, 62; American Sugar Refining Co. v. Louisiana, 179 U. S. 89, 94; Armour Packing Co. v. Lacy,
200 U. S. 226, 235; Brown-Forman Co. v. Kentucky, 217
U. S. 563, 573; Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co., 260 U. S. 245, 255; State Board of Tax Comm'rs,v. Jackson, 283
U. S. 527, 537, 538. What is true of division into classes according to subject matter must be true of division into classes dependent upon time. The temporal arrangement must have its origin, to be sure, in something more than whim or fantasy, a tyrannical exhibition of arbitrary power. If that reproach has been avoided, the classification does'not fail because the burdens before and after are not always and everywhere in perfect equilibrium.
From all this it follows that a distinction between wills or deeds effective before 1907 and those effective afterwards-the exercise or non-exercise of powers under instruments of the first class giving rise to a succession to be taxed as a bequest from the donee, and the exercise or non-exercise of powers under instruments of the second class to be taxed as a bequest from the donor-is not rooted in caprice. The point of time which separates the classes is not interjected arbitrarily or by an exertion of brute force, but corresponds to the behests of a rational taxonomy. This being so, the division ought not to fail because the deed of 1862 was framed in such a way that succession thereunder would not have been taxable to any one, either the estate of the donor or that of the donee, if a like deed had been executed after the passage of the statute. A legislature cannot be expected in drafting legislation to think out every conceivable situation in which the members of one class will bear a heavier burden than t1'e members of another. Under the statute challenged as invalid many deeds inter vivos continue to be taxable irrespective of their date.. Ai interest in re-

mainder to take effect in possession or enjoyment through the exercise or non-exercise of a power of appointment after the death of the donor (Guaranty Trust Co. v. Blodgett, supra) will gain nothing from the fact that a non-testamentary conveyance brought the power into be-
ing. The only reason why this particular interest would be exempt if the deed of 1862 had been made after August, 1907, is because the remainder was so limited that the
power might be exercised while the donor was yet alive. Such untoward accidents do not take a method of division out of the domain of the rational into the land of whim and fantasy. Eccentricities of incidence are common, and perhaps inevitable, in every system of taxation. 'The future would have to be scanned with microscopical powers of vision to foresee and forestall every possible diversity. For present purposes it is enough that the order of events removes the stigma of caprice from a system of classification whereby donees of a power before the passage of the act are treated as grantors, the tax to be laid upon that basis, whereas donors of a power are recognized as the source of the succession in respect of transfers afterwards. Emmons v. Shaw, supra. "And inequalities that result not from hostile discrimination, but occasionally and incidentally in the application of a system that is not arbitrary in its classification, are not sufficient to defeat the law." Maxwell v. Bugbee, 250 U. S. 525, 543. Cf. Metropolis Theatre Co. v. Chicago,228 U. S. 61. 69, 70; Salomon v. State Tax Comm'n, 278 U. S. 484, 491.
What has been said as to the deed of 1862 and the power there created applies with equal force to the will of 1891 and to the quantum of the tax payable by the legatees thereunder.
For these reasons I dissent from the modification of the decree and vote to affirm it.

MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS joins in this opinion.
