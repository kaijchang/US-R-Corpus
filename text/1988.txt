I. Access to Courts.
Death-rowinmates-Couniselfor postconvictionproceedings.-Court of Appeals' decision that indigent Virginia death-row inmates were denied meaningful access to courts because they were not guaranteed attorneys during postconviction proceedings, is reversed. Murray v. Giarratano, p. 1.

II. Cruel and Unusual Punishment.
1. Death penalty-Defendant aged 16 or 17 when crime committed.Imposition of capital punishment on an individual for a crime committed at age 16 or 17 does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment under Eighth Amendment. Stanford v. Kentucky, p. 361.
2. Death penalty-Mitigating evidence-Mentally retarded defendant.-Failure to give instructions informing a jury that it could consider and give effect to defendant's mitigating evidence of mental retardation and childhood abuse by declining to impose death penalty compels conclusion that jury was not provided with a vehicle for expressing its "reasoned moral response" to that evidence in rendering its sentencing decision as is required by Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments; however, Eighth Amendment does not categorically prohibit execution of mentally retarded capital murderers of petitioner's reasoning ability. Penry v. Lynaugh, p. 302.

III. Establishment of Religion.
Recairing holiday displays on public property.-Cr~chedepicting a Christian nativity scene placed on Grand Staircase of Allegheny County Courthouse, when viewed in its overall context, violates Establishment Clause; however, Court of Appeals' holding that a Chanukah menorah displayed outside City-County Building next to a decorated Christmas tree and a sign declaring city's "salute to liberty" also violated Establishment

INDEX
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW-Continued.
Clause, is reversed. County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, p. 573.
IV. Excessive Fines.
Punitive damages-Private parties-Federal common law. -Excessive Fines Clause of Eighth Amendment does not apply to punitive damages awards in cases between private parties; nor does federal common law provide a basis for disturbing a jury's punitive damages award. BrowningFerris Industries of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., p. 257.
V. Freedom of Speech.
1. Commercial speech-Application of least-restrictive-means testOverbreadth claim.-Although housewares parties conducted in campus dormitories constituted commercial speech, District Court was not required to apply a least-restrictive-means test to determine validity of a public school's resolution prohibiting commercial enterprises from operating in campus facilities; respondents' overbreadth claim-based on an assertion that resolution impermissibly prohibits noncommercial speech-is not ripe for review, since lower courts never considered an as-applied challenge, which should be decided before an overbreadth claim, and since lower courts never recognized that case involved both commercial and noncommercial speech. Board of Trustees of State University of New York v. Fox, p. 469.
2. Communications Act of 1934-Interstate transmission of obscene and indecenttelephone messages.-Section 223(b) of Act, which bans commercial telephone "dial-a-porn" messages, does not unconstitutionally prohibit interstate transmission of obscene commercial telephone messages, but it does unconstitutionally prohibit transmission of indecent messages. Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, p. 115.
VI. Privilege Against Self-Incrimination.
Adequacy of Mirandawarnings.- Informing a suspect that an attorney would be appointed for him "if and when you go to court" does not render warnings inadequate under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436. Duckworth v. Eagan, p. 195.
VII. Right to Abortion.
Preambleto state law-Restrictionon use ofpublicemployees, facilities, andfunds-Viability testing.-Constitutionality of Missouri abortion statute's preamble-which states that life begins at conception and that unborn children have certain rights -need not be determined, since preamble has not been applied to restrict rights of appellee abortion services providers; restrictions on use of public employees and facilities for performance or assistance of nontherapeutic abortions do not contravene Supreme Court's abortion decisions; controversy over prohibition on use of public funds to

INDEX

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW-Continued.
encourage or counsel a woman to have a nontherapeutic abortion is moot, since appellees contend that, given State's interpretation of provision, they are not adversely affected by it; Court of Appeals' decision that provision requiring a physician to determine if an unborn child is viable before he can perform an abortion on a woman whom he believes is carrying an unborn child of 20 or more weeks gestation violates Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113, and subsequent cases, is reversed. Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, p. 490.

VIII. Right to Counsel.
Right to counsel-Assistance of counsel-Evidence of future dangerousness. -Where Texas law prohibits imposing a death sentence on an individual when State has shown no probability that he would commit future acts of violence constituting a continuing threat to society, and where neither defendant Powell nor his counsel were notified that a psychiatric examination of Powell to determine his competency for trial would also include an examination on issue of future dangerousness, evidence of future dangerousness was taken in deprivation of Powell's Sixth Amendment right to assistance of counsel. Powell v. Texas, p. 680.

IX. Right to Jury Trial.
Bankruptcy trustee's suit to recover an allegedly fraudulenttransfer.Provided that Congress has not permissibly assigned resolution of claim to a non-Article III adjudicative body that does not use a jury as factfinder, Seventh Amendment entitles a person who has not submitted a claim against a bankruptcy estate to a jury trial when sued by bankruptcy trustee to recover an allegedly fraudulent monetary transfer. Granfinanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg, p. 33.

X. States' Immunity from Suit.
Bankruptcy Code-Monetary recovery.-Court of Appeals' judgment that plain language of § 106(c) of Bankruptcy Code abrogates sovereign immunity only to extent necessary to determine a State's rights in debtor's estate and does not abrogate such immunity from recovery of an avoided preferential transfer of money or from a turnover proceeding, is affirmed. Hoffman v. Connecticut Dept. of Income Maintenance, p. 96.

2. Supreme Court- Questionproperlypresentedfor review-Requestfor jury trial.-Where issue was not raised below, Court declines to address respondent's contention that petitioner Granfinanciera was a commercial instrumentality of Colombian Government when it made its request for a jury trial below and was therefore not entitled to such a trial under Seventh Amendment or statutory provisions.

JUSTICE MARSHALL, dissenting.
Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 231 (1976) (MARSHALL J., dissenting), I would grant the petition for certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case. But

MARSHALL, J., dissenting

even if I did not hold this view, I would still grant the petition. The record in this case strongly suggests that, in the words of the dissenting judge below, "certain remarks by the court during the penalty phase, superimposed upon an emotional episode that had already occurred in the jury room, had an improperly coercive effect upon the jury's deliberations and improperly influenced the verdict." 46 Cal. 3d 478, 545, 758 P. 2d 1081, 1124 (1988) (Kauf-
man, J., dissenting in part). I would therefore grant certiorari, both to ascertain whether petitioner was denied his right to an uncoerced verdict, and to clarify our standards for determining jury coercion, a subject discussed most recently in Lowenfield v. Phelps, 484 U. S. 231 (1988).
The penalty phase in question was described at length in the majority and partially dissenting opinions below, 46 Cal. 3d, at 527-544, 758 P. 2d, at 1112-1124 (majority opinion); id., at 545550, 758 P. 2d, at 1124-1129 (Kaufman, J., dissenting in part), and so only a brief account is necessary here. During jury deliberations, only one juror held out: an elderly woman who refused to vote to impose the death penalty. After a day of deliberations, another juror rose out of his chair and verbally attacked her in a tirade that apparently included a death threat. Id., at 545, 758 P. 2d, at 1125. Crying and shaking, she left the jury room and went to a bathroom, where she vomited. In response, the foreman sent the judge notes indicating that there was one holdout against imposing the death penalty. Ibid.
The judge then recalled the jury. He told the jury that the
court was required to investigate the jury's "problem" by questioning the foreman and, perhaps, "'the one or more jurors who may be having difficulty in reaching a verdict."' Id., at 546, 758 P. 2d, at 1125. He added that, if necessary, he would determine whether or not "one or more of the jurors are refusing to adhere to the law and the evidence," ibid. (emphasis omitted); he added that he had expected that the jury would have delivered a verdict by then. Id., at 546, 758 P. 2d, at 1126. The judge told the jurors that he was sending them home for the weekend so that they could search their consciences. He then recognized the foreman, who stated that the weekend release would be a "fine gesture," and that "we should have a verdict come Monday." Ibid. The judge responded: "Good. Well, I'm glad to hear you say that. I appreciate that." Ibid. After only one hour of delib-

OCTOBER TERM, 1988

April 3, 1989

490 U. S.

erations Monday morning, the jurors voted unanimously to impose the death penalty.
In Lowenfield, the Court observed that "[a]ny criminal defendant, and especially any capital defendant, being tried by a jury is entitled to the uncoerced verdict of that body." 484 U. S., at 241. To determine if coercion has occurred, courts must "consider the
supplemental charge given by the trial court 'in its context and under all the circumstances."' Id., at 237 (citation omitted). We held that the particular supplemental charges and jury polling at issue had not resulted in coercion, but that other instructions and comments might require a different conclusion. Id., at 241.
In my view, this case presents a far more compelling circumstance for finding jury coercion than did Lowenfield. As the dissenting judge below observed, the holdout juror, given her emotional condition, the verbal attack upon her, and the judge's indication that he would have to investigate one or more jurors
"may well have interpreted these statements as meaning the
court expected a verdict on Monday and that it wanted her personally to resolve any lingering doubts she may have had about the appropriateness of imposing the death penalty. It is also highly likely [she] believed that, by agreeing to the death verdict on Monday, she could avoid the threatened investigation by the court and the attorneys of the jury room incident and of her reluctance to vote for death." 46 Cal. 3d, at 547-548, 758 P. 2d, at 1127.

The petitioner here was entitled to have the decision whether
he "deserve[d] to live or die ... made on scales that are not deliberately tipped toward death." Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U. S. 510, 521-522, n. 20 (1968). Because the actions of the trial judge in this case raise serious doubts about whether the context and circumstances of the death sentence in this case were coercive, and thus whether the scales of justice were in equipoise when the time for that decision came, I would grant the petition for review. I dissent.

JUSTICE BRENNAN and JUSTICE MARSHALL, dissenting.
Adhering to our views that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 227, 231 (1976), we would grant certiorari and vacate the death sentences in these cases.

JUSTICE WHITE, dissenting.
Respondent Frank Padilla, a roofing consultant, filed suit in New Mexico state court alleging a breach of contract by petitioner Pueblo of Acoma, doing business as Sky City Contractors. Petitioner had hired respondent to supervise Sky City's installation of roofs on two building projects located off the Acoma Indian Reservation. The New Mexico Supreme Court held that petitioner was not protected from suit by tribal sovereign immunity. 107 N. M. 174, 754 P. 2d 845 (1988). According to the New Mexico court, a State's "exercise of jurisdiction over a sovereign Indian tribe for off-reservation conduct is solely a matter of comity." Id., at 179, 754 P. 2d, at 850 (citing Nevada v. Hall, 440 U. S. 410 (1979)). Because the State of New Mexico allows breach of contract actions to be brought against itself, the court reasoned, such actions were allowable against Indian tribes as well.
This decision conflicts with decisions of the Arizona courts applying tribal sovereign immunity to off-reservation activities. In Morgan v. Colorado River Indian Tribe, 103 Ariz. 425, 427-428, 443 P. 2d 421, 423-424 (1968), the Arizona Supreme Court held that the Colorado River Indian Tribe was immune from suit for an accident at the Blue Water Marina Park, a tribal enterprise located outside the boundaries of its reservation. The court did not treat the question as one of comity; indeed, the court noted that under identical circumstances the State of Arizona would be liable. Id., at 428, n. 1, 443 P. 2d, at 424, n. 1. See also S. Unique, Ltd. v. GilaRiver Pima-MaricopaIndian Community, 138 Ariz. 378, 380-381, 674 P. 2d 1376, 1378-1379 (App. 1983)

(breach of contract action arising out of business transaction initiated off reservation). The doctrine of tribal sovereign immunity, as applied by the Arizona courts, extends not only to an Indian tribe but also to a "subordinate economic organization" of the tribe. White Mountain Apache Indian Tribe v. Shelley, 107 Ariz. 4, 6-7, 480 P. 2d 654, 656-657 (1971); Smith PlumbingCo. v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 149 Ariz. 524, 532, 720 P. 2d 499, 507, cert. denied, 479 U. S. 987 (1986). The New Mexico Supreme Court expressly recognized that Sky City Contractors was a subordinate economic organization of petitioner, 107 N. M., at 178, 754 P. 2d, at 849 (citing White Mountain Apache, supra), yet nevertheless held that it was not immune from suit.
An opportunity to resolve this conflict was presented by our grant of certiorari in Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Graham,488 U. S. 816 (1988), although we ultimately decided the case on other grounds. In that case, two questions were before us: whether the case had been properly removed to federal court and whether tribal sovereign immunity barred an action to collect taxes "on commercial activities conducted by an Indian tribe on off-reservation lands." We held that the case had not been properly removed, Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Graham,489 U. S. 838 (1989) (percuriam), and as a result did not need to reach the sovereign immunity question. The present case provides an opportunity to resolve the issue we did not reach in Graham and thereby to resolve the conflict among the state courts.
I would grant the petition for certiorari and resolve the question on which we previously granted certiorari but did not decide.

Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 231 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting), I would grant the petition for certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case.
Even if I did not hold this view, I would still grant the petition and vacate petitioner's death sentence, so that we might address petitioner's claim that he was denied effective assistance of counsel at the penalty phase of his trial. After an extended hearing, the District Court granted petitioner's writ of habeas corpus, ruling that petitioner had not received effective assistance of counsel, and a panel of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed. The panel's judgment, however, was overturned

ORDERS

MARSHALL, J., dissenting

by the Court of Appeals sitting en banc, over a strong dissenting opinion which three judges joined. 863 F. 2d 1377, 1394 (1988) (McMillian, J., dissenting, joined by Lay, C. J., and Heaney and
Arnold, JJ.). In my view, the behavior of petitioner's attorney at the penalty
phase was plainly deficient, depriving his client of "the 'counsel' guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment." Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 687 (1984). The attorney offered literally no evidence in mitigation. This inaction cannot be explained by a dearth of potentially mitigating evidence. On the contrary, the attorney knew of, but failed to investigate, a number of facts about petitioner on which quite credible arguments in mitigation could have been made. Petitioner told his attorney, for example, that he had fought for this country in Vietnam and received an honorable discharge from the Army. 863 F. 2d, at 1396 (dissenting opinion). The attorney, however, failed to pursue this claim. Had he done so, he would have learned that petitioner had earned the National Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, the Vietnam Campaign Medal, and the Good Conduct Medal. Id., at 1397.
The attorney also knew that many of the soldiers who served in the Vietnam conflict suffered severe emotional trauma afterwards, encountering problems of socialization and readjustment. In some cases, they have suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder so severe as to induce violent criminality, a fact recognized by Congress when it passed the Veterans Health Care Amendments of 1979, 38 U. S. C. § 612 et seq. 863 F. 2d, at 1396-1397. The attorney failed, too, to explore this potential source of mitigating evidence, deciding after a sketchy telephone conversation with petitioner's stepmother and after a brief conversation with his brother not to interview the family. Id., at 1395-1396. Had he done so, he would have learned that after his experience in Vietnam, petitioner "changed from a church-going young man who had never had any trouble with the law to a nervous and withdrawn loner constantly in trouble, in and out of prison." Id., at 1397. The attorney also
failed to explore petitioner's postdischarge psychiatric records, documents which would have provided "even more evidence of [petitioner's] personality change after his military service in Vietnam."

It is questionable, to say the least, whether under these facts counsel's performance was indeed reasonable so as to satisfy the first prong of the two-pronged test for ineffective assistance set forth in Strickland. This conclusion is especially doubtful given that this is a capital case, posing the heaviest professional responsibility on counsel. Yet that is precisely what the en banc Court of Appeals held in this case. 863 F. 2d, at 1394. In my view, the decision below calls into question whether the Strickland test is to have any vitality at all. To establish that there are minimal thresholds below which counsel cannot go, I would grant the petition for certiorari.

JUSTICE WHITE, with whom JUSTICE BRENNAN joins, dissenting.
In August 1987, two police officers observed a car parked in a high-crime area of New York City. Seated in the front seat of the car was its owner and another occupant; petitioner was in the back seat. The officers approached the car and began to ask questions of the owner. As they did this, they saw petitioner lean over and appear to place an object on the floor. Fearful that the item might be a weapon, the officers ordered the men out of the car and searched its interior. The front and back seat areas were searched. When one officer lifted the rear floormat, he found a packet of currency there. He picked up the packet, removed a rubber band, and examined the bills closely. He observed that all the bills had the same serial number and concluded that they were counterfeit. Petitioner was arrested and charged with a counterfeiting offense.
The District Court granted petitioner's motion to suppress the fruits of the search of the packet, but the Second Circuit reversed. 850 F. 2d 93 (1988). The panel majority agreed with petitioner that the officer, upon determining that the item beneath the floor mat was neither a weapon nor plainly contraband, "had no basis to take any further action." Id., at 98. "[A]bsent either probable cause or self-evident contraband the search and seizure of these bills was unjustified," the Court of Appeals concluded. Ibid. However, the Second Circuit nonetheless refused to suppress the evidence so obtained because it found that petitioner lacked a "reasonable expectation of privacy in the area searched." Ibid.
As I see it, the decision below was incorrect; it at least merits review here. The Fourth Amendment protects from unreasonable searches not only an individual's home and person, but also his effects. Even granting that petitioner had no "expectation of privacy" in the back seat of the car, he had standing to object to the violation of his Fourth Amendment rights when an admittedly illegal search and seizure of his property was conducted. To conclude otherwise, as the Second Circuit did here, would suggest

ORDERS

WHITE, J., dissenting

that when someone lays a sheaf of papers down on a sales counter, or places a stack of documents on the bus seat beside him, or the like, the police may come along, pick up these items, and rifle through them-even if the officers lack probable cause or reasonable suspicion or any basis whatsoever for the search or seizure. None of our precedents reflects such an interpretation of the Fourth Amendment with respect to the right to resist the search
and seizure of one's possessions, even when those possessions are in public places.
In its decision below, the Court of Appeals relied on our prior rulings in Rawlings v. Kentucky, 448 U. S. 98 (1980); United States v. Salvucci, 448 U. S. 83 (1980); and Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U. S. 128 (1978). These cases do support the notion that merely having a property right in a seized item does not give one standing to challenge the unlawful search of another person's property to find that item. Salvucci, supra, at 91; Rawlings, supra, at 105-106. But this case is different from the cases on which the Second Circuit relied. In those cases, the aggrieved defendants sought to challenge the legality of searches of others' private places, when those searches revealed contraband items belonging to the defendants. In this case, though, the officers opened and examined an item belonging to petitioner which, on its face, offered no justification for such an examination. This case is thus like the one we left open in Rakas, supra, at 142, n. 11.
We have noted repeatedly in the past that the Fourth Amendment "protects people, not places." Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347, 351 (1967). Just because petitioner's packet was in a place that was not private does not deprive him of a right to resist a search of that packet, any more than Chadwick was so deprived by his placement of his suitcase in a car which the police had no cause to search. See United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1 (1977); United States v. Ross, 456 U. S. 798, 812-813 (1982). Simply put, the Second Circuit confused petitioner's lack of standing to challenge the search of another's car for an item belonging to petitioner, with petitioner's right to challenge the search of an item belonging to him that was found within the car.
Nor is the sweep of the ruling below limited by observing that petitioner could have preserved his privacy interest in the packet
of bills if he had kept it on his person. Such a view suggests that the officers could not have taken petitioner's wallet from his person and examined its contents but could have searched his brief-

case if he had had one on the seat beside him. It also suggests that the police, without a warrant or probable cause, could search and seize a person's briefcase checked in a public checkroom, or his luggage in a hotel lobby, or his personal effects in a public place. In none of these instances would such a person have standing to object to the officer's being where he was, but to say that he may not object to the seizure of his effects is suspect and merits review here. Consequently, I dissent from the Court's denial of review in this case.

Memorandum of JUSTICE STEVENS respecting the denial of the petition for writ of certiorari.
There are times when it is important to emphasize the fact that an order denying a petition for a writ of certiorari is not a ruling on the merits of any question presented by the petition. See Singleton v. Commissioner, 439 U. S. 940, 942 (1978) (STEVENS, J., respecting denial of certiorari). In my opinion, this is such an occasion.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA and JUSTICE KENNEDY join, dissenting.
In this case, the Court of Appeals has misread a statute designed to protect the rights of a class of federal workers and misapplied our decision in United States v. Testan, 424 U. S. 392 (1976). The result is a jurisdictional ruling which even respondent here, the United States, does not defend. The Solicitor General has informed this Court that the United States views the jurisdictional holding of the Court of Appeals as plainly wrong and asks that its decision be vacated and remanded. See Brief for United States 6-7. Because the error is plain, and because it carries the clear potential of compounding itself in the Back Pay Act jurisprudence of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, I would grant the petition and summarily reverse the judgment below.
Petitioner, a former member of the United States Secret Service Uniformed Division (USSSUD), was involved in a motorcycle accident while allegedly responding to a call for relief at 1310 L Street, N. W., in Washington, D. C., which is the headquarters of the Secret Service. As he and a fellow officer were passing through a private alley on motorcycles, an automobile exited from

ORDERS

1054

O'CONNOR, J., dissenting

an underground garage and struck petitioner's motorcycle, pinning him underneath his vehicle. Petitioner received immediate medical care, and later underwent corrective surgery for damage to his left knee. After the accident, in order to receive paid adminis-
trative leave, petitioner requested a determination that the accident occurred in the performance of his duties. Such a determination was critical to petitioner's rights under 5 U. S. C. § 6324(a), which provides: "Sick leave may not be charged to the account of a member of the Metropolitan Police force or the Fire Department of the District of Columbia, the United States Park Police force, or the Executive Protective Service force for an absence due to injury or illness resulting from the performance of duty." Pursuant to agency regulations, an investigation and subsequent review by the Administrative Review Board were conducted. The agency determined that under its regulations petitioner's injury did not occur in "the performance of duty" due to the fact that he was in violation of local traffic regulations and USSSUD regulations at the time of the accident. Petitioner was thus denied administrative leave for the period of his convalescence, and after his sick leave was exhausted, he was placed on leave without pay.
Petitioner subsequently brought this action in the United States Claims Court, seeking a determination that he was erroneously denied paid administrative leave by the agency and was thus entitled to an award of backpay for the period in question. Petitioner premised the Claims Court's jurisdiction on that portion of the Tucker Act now codified at 28 U. S. C. § 1491(a)(1), which provides generally that the United States Claims Court "shall have jurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim against the United States founded .. .upon . ..any Act of Congress." The "Act of Congress" upon which petitioner relied was the Back Pay Act, 5 U. S. C. § 5596, which provides in pertinent part:
"(b)(1) An employee of an agency who . . . is found by appropriate authority under applicable law, rule, regulation, or collective bargaining agreement, to have been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action which has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of all or part of the pay, allowances, or differentials of the employee-
"(A) is entitled ... [to] ... "(i)an amount equal to all or any part of the pay, allowances or differentials, as applicable, which the employee nor-

O'CONNOR, J., dissenting

mally would have earned or received during the period if the personnel action had not occurred."
In essence, petitioner claimed that 5 U. S. C. § 6324(a) was an "applicable law" within the meaning of the Back Pay Act and that the allegedly erroneous denial of his request for paid administrative leave was an "unwarranted personnel action" which entitled him to an award of lost wages against the United States. The Claims Court ruled against petitioner on the merits, finding that the agency's decision that petitioner was not injured in the performance of his duties was supported by substantial evidence and not legally arbitrary or capricious. 12 Cl. Ct. 744 (1987).
On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit did not reach the merits of petitioner's claims. 857 F. 2d 763 (1988). Instead that court ruled that the Claims Court lacked jurisdiction over this action. Relying on our decision in United States v. Testan, supra, the Court of Appeals held that "consent to suit against the United States for back pay must be 'unequivocally expressed' and .. .5 U. S. C. §6324 does not express such consent." 857 F. 2d, at 764. The Court of Appeals also relied on its earlier decision in Hambsch v. United States, 848 F. 2d 1228 (1988), where it stated: "[T]he parties often speak of section 6324 as if it requires that police officers be placed on administrative leave if injured in the performance of duty, yet the statute doesn't say that. It says they must not be placed on sick leave. This implication from a negative may indicate an intent to create liability for back pay for violation, but it is hard to say that it does so 'unequivocally."' Id., at 1231. The Court of Appeals vacated the decision below and remanded to the Claims Court with instructions to dismiss petitioner's complaint for want of jurisdiction. 857 F. 2d, at 765.
In United States v. Testan, we dealt with a claim by Government employees that they had erroneously been classified in a pay grade lower than those who did substantially identical work in the same agency. We held that neither the Classification Act, 5 U. S. C. § 5101 et. seq., nor the Back Pay Act could trigger the Tucker Act jurisdiction of the former Court of Claims in the circumstances of that case. We noted that "the Back Pay Act, as its words so clearly indicate, was intended to grant a monetary cause of action only to those who were subjected to a reduction in their duly appointed emoluments or position." 424 U. S., at 407. The

ORDERS

1054

O'CONNOR, J., dissenting

plaintiffs in Testan were not such employees because they were not claiming a right "to receive only the salary of the position to which [they were] appointed"; rather they sought reclassification into a new position and pay grade. Thus Testan makes clear, and our subsequent cases have reaffirmed, that the Back Pay Act itself is an explicit consent to suit by the United States as to a claim by a federal employee that the pay or emoluments of his or her position have been wrongfully withheld in violation of an "applicable law, rule, regulation, or collective bargaining agreement." See, e. g., United States v. Hopkins, 427 U. S. 123, 128 (1976) ("The Back Pay Act is the means by which appointed employees subjected to unjustified personnel action are given a cause of action against the United States"); accord, Bush v. Lucas, 462 U. S. 367, 385, n. 25 (1983); Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U. S. 879, 905-906, n. 42 (1988). It follows that the Court of Appeals erred in searching for an explicit waiver of immunity from suit in § 6324; that explicit waiver is found in the Back Pay Act itself. The Court of Appeals' interpretation of Testan would render the Back-Pay Act a nullity, for rarely if ever will an agency personnel regulation or collective bargaining agreement contain an express waiver of the sovereign immunity of the United States. The proper inquiry is simply whether the employee alleges the violation of a statute, rule, or provision of a collective bargaining agreement which has resulted in the unlawful withholding of compensation to which he or she would otherwise be entitled.
There is little doubt that the violation of 5 U. S. C. § 6324 alleged by petitioner here is exactly the type of "unwarranted personnel action" addressed by the Back Pay Act. As the Claims Court put it: "In 5 U. S. C. § 6324, Congress established a statutory right to administrative leave rather than sick leave to members of the USSSUD where an absence is due to an injury or illness resulting from the performance of duty." 12 Cl. Ct., at 749. Section 6324 appears in Subchapter 2 of Chapter 63 of Title 5 which is entitled "Other Paid Leave" and stands in contradistinction to Subchapter 1 of Chapter 63 which covers "Annual and Sick Leave." Moreover, the legislative history of § 6324, which was originally enacted in 1964, indicates that Congress intended to prohibit the taxing of sick leave against USSSUD employees injured in the performance of their duties in order to make clear their entitlement to paid administrative leave. Congress expressed concern that such

1058

OCTOBER TERM, 1988

O'CONNOR, J., dissenting

490 U. S.

employees were often required to use annual leave or leave without pay for nonwork-related illnesses because they were obligated to expend their sick leave on job-related injuries. See H. R. Rep. No. 1220, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., 1 (1964). Indeed, the Secretary of the Treasury, who is charged with promulgating regulations implementing § 6324, understands that section to create an entitlement to administrative paid leave where it is determined that the injury occurred in the performance of the officer's duties. See USSSUD Manual, chs. 2.7.22 and 2.7.23. Further, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, which has had occasion to interpret § 6324 as it applies to members of the District of Columbia Police and Fire Departments, likewise understands that section to require that employees injured in the performance of their duties be placed on administrative paid leave. See Brown v. Jefferson, 451 A. 2d 74, 75 (1982). The Court of Appeals' contrary interpretation of § 6324 leads to incongruous results. It imputes to Congress an intent to deny to employees injured in the performance of their duties, and only such employees, the right to take sick leave. Thus, an employee injured at home would be entitled to expend available sick leave, while an employee injured in the performance of his or her duties would be prohibitcd by statute from taking such leave and thus would have to expend annual leave or go on leave without pay.
In my view, the jurisdictional holding of the Court of Appeals is quite clearly wrong, and as the Solicitor General points out, this jurisdictional error will preclude review in a rather large class of cases falling within its scope. Brief for United States 7. Moreover, the Court of Appeal's misinterpretation of our decision in Testan threatens to do continuing damage as that court searches
for explicit waivers of the sovereign immunity of the United States in agency personnel rules and collective bargaining agreements. For these reasons, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this case for further proceedings not in-
consistent with the principles enunciated above. In this regard, I note that the Court of Appeals made passing reference to the possible applicability of our decision in United States v. Fausto, 484 U. S. 439 (1988), to petitioner's claims. 857 F. 2d, at 764. Because the Court of Appeals did not rest its judgment on that ground, and because the Solicitor General explicitly disclaims any reliance on Fausto in this Court, see Brief for United States 4, n. 6, I express no opinion on this issue.

BRENNAN, J., dissenting

490 U. S.

and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 227 (1976), I would grant the motion for a stay of execution and the petition for a writ of certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case.
II
Even if I did not take this view, I would grant the petition to consider whether the sentencing procedure in this case violated the Eighth Amendment requirement that a convicted defendant have the opportunity to present any relevant mitigating evidencenot just statutory mitigating factors-at the sentencing hearing. Hitchcock v. Dugger, 481 U. S. 393 (1987). The Florida Supreme Court declined to find petitioner's Hitchcock claim procedurally barred and addressed this claim on the merits. Adams v. State, 543 So. 2d 1244, 1247 (1989). Likewise, the District Court addressed the merits, determining that petitioner's "is not a proper Hitchcock issue." No. 89-67-Civ-Oc-16, p. 5 (MD Fla., May 3, 1989). Moreover, since Hitchcock was not decided until after petitioner had filed his second federal habeas petition, I detect no abuse of the writ in petitioner raising this claim now for the first time.
At the time petitioner was sentenced, Florida's "standard jury instructions included a charge which had the effect of limiting the jury's consideration to the statutory aggravating and mitigating circumstances," 543 So. 2d, at 1247, reflecting what may have been the general belief in the State, based upon decisions such as Cooper v. State, 336 So. 2d 1133 (Fla. 1976), that mitigating factors not specifically itemized in the statute, Fla. Stat. § 921.141 (1975), were not to be taken into account in sentencing. Reasonably believing that state law prohibited a jury or court from considering nonstatutory factors at sentencing, a Florida lawyer might rationally have declined to divert resources from other aspects of case development into the investigation, development, and presentation of evidence of such factors. Indeed, two of petitioner's counsel have filed affidavits to the effect that, operating on the basis of what they understood to be the law at the time, they did not pursue nonstatutory mitigating evidence because they did not believe it would be admissible. I would grant certiorari in this case to consider whether state-generated disincentives to the pursuit and presentation of mitigating evidence infected petitioner's sentencing with constitutional error.

The trial judge in this case initially denied petitioner's request for a sentencing instruction to the jury that they might consider nonstatutory mitigating factors. After the prosecutor's closing argument at sentencing, however, the trial judge announced that he had changed his mind, and that because the prosecutor's closing had listed statutory mitigating circumstances as the only mitigating factors the jury could consider, he would give the requested instruction that "'[t]he aggravating circumstances which you may consider are limited to those upon which I've just instructed you. However, there is no such limitation upon the mitigating factors you may consider."' See 543 So. 2d, at 1247. This change of mind appears to have come too late to allow petitioner's counsel to develop the mitigating evidence that the court's prior ruling, and existing Florida law, had reasonably led them to believe would be inadmissible. A belated instruction to consider mitigating evidence cannot cure a defect the effect of which has been to ensure that there is little or no nonstatutory mitigating evidence for the jury or court to consider.

JUSTICE WHITE, dissenting.
Petitioner Christy is a herder who grazed his sheep on leased land near Glacier National Park. Between July 1 and July 9, 1982, grizzly bears from the park killed 20 of Christy's sheep. Requests for assistance from park rangers yielded no results, and efforts to frighten away the bears were unsuccessful. On July 9, when two grizzlies emerged from the forest and approached Christy's sheep, he shot and killed a bear. Grizzlies, however, are an "endangered species"; Christy's killing of the bear thus violated the Endangered Species Act, which makes it unlawful to "harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect" grizzlies and other animals protected by the statute. 16 U.

§§ 1538(a)(1), 1532(19). Christy was consequently assessed a $2,500 penalty for shooting the bear.
Christy then filed this action in District Court, seeking to enjoin enforcement of the Act against herders like himself, and resisting payment of the $2,500 penalty. Christy claimed, inter alia, that his actions in defense of his livestock were protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment; alternatively, Christy contended that the Act resulted in an uncompensated "taking" of his property. Both the District Court and the Ninth Circuit rejected these claims, and this petition ensued.
I would grant the petition for certiorari to consider Christy's
constitutional claims. Christy's claim of a constitutional right to defend his property is not insubstantial. The right to defend one's property has long been recognized at common law, see W. Blackstone, Commentaries *138-140, and is deeply rooted in the legal traditions of this country, see, e. g., Beard v. United States, 158 U. S. 550, 555 (1895). Having the freedom to take actions necessary to protect one's property may well be a liberty "deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition," Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494, 503 (1977) (opinion of Powell, J.), and, therefore, entitled to the substantive protection of the Due Process Clause. In any event, Christy's claim to such protection presents an interesting and important question-the proper resolution of which is not altogether clear-that merits plenary review.
Even more substantial is Christy's claim that the Endangered Species Act operates as a governmental authorization of a "taking" of his property; leaving him uncompensated for this taking violates the Fifth Amendment, Christy contends. There can be little doubt that if a federal statute authorized park rangers to come around at night and take Christy's livestock to feed the bears, such a governmental action would constituted a "taking." The Court of Appeals below, and the federal parties in their submission here, distinguish such a case from this one, by noting that the United States "does not 'own' the wild animals it protects, nor does the government control the conduct of such animals." Christy v. Hodel, 857 F. 2d 1324, 1335 (CA9 1988); see Brief in Opposition 7.
Perhaps not; but the Government does make it unlawful for
Christy to "harass, harm, [or] pursue" such animals when they come to take his property-and perhaps a Government edict bar-

ring one from resisting the loss of one's property is the constitutional equivalent of an edict taking such property in the first place. Thus, if the Government decided (in lieu of the food stamp program) to enact a law barring grocery store owners from "harassing, harming, or pursuing" people who wish to take food off grocery shelves without paying for it, such a law might well be suspect under the Fifth Amendment. For similar reasons, the Endangered Species Act may be suspect as applied in Christy's case.
In sum, sustaining grizzly bears is a worthwhile and important governmental objective. But it "is axiomatic that the Fifth Amendment's just compensation provision is 'designed to bar Government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole."' First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, 482 U. S. 304, 318-319 (1987) (quoting Armstrong v. United States, 364 U. S. 40, 49 (1960)). Here, Christy has been asked to bear the burden of feeding endangered grizzlies -or at the least, has been estopped from taking measures necessary to prevent the use of his property for this purpose. Thus, it seems quite possible that Christy has been denied the Fifth Amendment's protection against uncompensated
takings.
Because I think that Christy's constitutional claims present interesting and important questions that merit our attention, I dissent from the Court's denial of review in this case.
