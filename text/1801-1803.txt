I!
PREFACE.
M ucH of that uncertainty of the law, which is
fb frequently, and perhaps fo juftly, the fublje&.of com plaint in this country, may be attributed to the want of American reports.
Many of the caufes, which are the fubje& of litigation in our courts, arif6 upon circumftances peculiar to ouT fituation and laws, and little information can be derived from Engliflh authorities to lead to a correc decifion.
Uniformity, in fuch cafes, can not be expe 'ed where the judicial authority is flaired among fuch a vaft num, ber of independent tribunals, unlefs the decifions of the various courts are made known to each other. Even in the fame court, analogy of judgment can not be maintained if its -adjudications are fuffered to be forgotten, It is therefore much to be regretted that fo few of the gentlemen of the bar have been willing to undertake the talk of reporting.
.In a government which is emphatically filed a go-ern. rnent.of laws, the leaft poffible range ought to be left for the difcretion of the judge. Whatever tends to render the laws certain, equally tends to limit that difcretion; and perhaps nothing conduces more to that objeCk than the publication of 'reports. Every cafe decided is a-check upon the judge. He can not decide a fimilar cafe differently, without flrong reafons, which, for hi.

iv
oG¢n juflification, he will wifl to make public. The ave. nues to corruption are thus obflruaed, and the fources of litigation clofed,
One of the effeas,,expeaed from. the eftablifhment of a national judiciary, was the uniformity of judicial decifion ; an attempt, therefore, to report the cafes decided by the Supreme' Court of the United States, can niot need an apology; and perhaps none can be given ..or the inadequate manner in which that attempt has been executed. It has been the endeavor of the Re,Porter to give a faithful fummary of the arguments of counfel. To do them complete juftice he acknowledges himfelf incompetent. In no inflance, perhaps, has he'.given the words in which the ideas were conveyed, as his attention was almoft entirely occupied in colle&ing the point of the argument. He may have omitted ideas deemed important, and added others fup. pofed to be impertinent; but in no cafe has he'intention. ally diminifhed the weight of the argument. It may pofJibly be allegedthat he has introduced into the reports of fome of the cafes more of the record than was neceffar'y. If he has erred in this, he has been led into the error by- obferving that many of the cafes in the books are rendered ufelefs by the want of a fufficient flateinent' of the cafe as it appeared upon th6 record; and he imagined it would be a lefs fault to infert too much, than to omit any thing material.,
He has been relieved from much anxiety, as well as refponfibility, by the praaice which th. court has adopt.

ed of reducing their opinion to w'-iting, in all cafes of difficulty or importance; and he 'tenders his tribute of acknowledgement for the readinefs with which he was peirmitted to take copies of thofe opinions%
He is indebted to Mr. Caldwell, for his notes of the cafes which were decided prior to February term 1803, without the affiftance of which he would have been unable to report thm, as his own notes of thofe cafes, not having been taken with that view, were very imperfea.
He alfo feels his obligation to thofe gentlemen of the bar, whofe politenefs has prompted a ready communication of their notes, which have enabled him more corre&ly to report their arguments.
Should an apology be deemed neceffary for the liber. ty he has taken in his notes to fome of the cafes report. ed, that apology exifis in a wifh candidly to invefligate the truth. In doing this in a refpeCtful manner, lie doesnot feel confcious of giving caufe of offence to liberal
and candid minds. If the fate of the prefent volume ffiopld not prove him
totally inadequate to the talk he has undertaken, it is bis intention to report the cafe of fucceediiig terms.

NPPENDIX.
NOTE (A.)
THE queftion of liability of a remote indorfer of a promif-
fory note, in Virginia, came before the court below about a year before their decifion in the prefent cafe. It was in the cafe of Dunlop v. Silvtr and others, argued at July term i8ox in Alexandria. The court took the vacation to confider the cafe, and examine the law, and at the fucceeding term judgment was rendered for the plaintiff by Kilty, chief judge, and Cranch, affiftant judge, contrary to the opinion of judge Marfhall.
The cafe was this. James Cavan made a promiffory note, by which he promifed to pay to Silver et a]. or order, fixty days after date, 6oo dollars for value received, negotiable at the bank of Alexandria. Silver et al. indorfed the note to Downing and Dowell in thefe words, " pay the contents to Downing and Dowell," who indorfed, " pay the 41contents to John Dunlop or order." Dunlop had obtained judgment on the note againfi Cavan, the maker, who was taken upon the execution, and took the oath of an infolvent debtor.
The declaration had two counts. ift. A fpecial count flating the making and indorfing the note, the fuit, judgment, execution and infolvency of Cavan, by reafon whereof the defendant became liable, &c. 2dly. Indebitatus afumpjfit for money had and received.
The plea was non ajfumpfit, and a verdi& was taken for the plaintiff; fubject to the opinion of the court upon the point, whether the holder can maintain an aaion againft the remote indorfer of a promiffory note.
The ftatute of 3 and 4 Anne, c. 9, refpe&ing promiffory notes, is not it force in Virginia; but there is an a6t of affembly, 1786, chap. 29, by which it is enaded that " an action of debt may be maintained upon .
note or writing, by which the perfon figning the fame fhall promifi: or oblige himfelf to pay a fum of money, or quantity of tobacco, to

APPENDIX.
" another ;" and that " affignments of bonds, bills and promiffory " notes, and other writings obligatory, for payment of money or to" bacco,fiall be valid; and an aflignee of any fuch may thereupon " maintain an adion of debt in his own name; but fhall allow all juft
difcounts, not only againft himfelf, but againft the affignor, before "c notice of the affignment was given to the defendant."
It will be. obferved that this adl gives no action againft the indorfer, or affignor, nor does it make any diftin~tion between notes payable to order, and thofe payable only to the payee. Hence, perhaps, it may be inferred that it left fuch inftruments as the parties themfelves by the original contrac had made, (or intended to make,) negotiable, to be governed by fuch principles of law as may be applicable to thofe inftruments. At any rate it feemed to be admitted that the ad did not affeCt the prefent cafe.
The principal queftion then is, whether this affion could have been fupported in England before the flatute of Anne.
I. In order to afcertain how the law flood before that ifatute it may be neccffary to examine how far the cuftom of merchants, or the h,x mercatoria, was recognized by the courts of juftice, and by what means the common law forms of judicial proceedings were adapted to its principles.
A diftindion feems to have been made very early between the contrats of inerchants, (efpecially of foreign merchants,) and thofe of other people. Nearly fix hundred years ago, we find their " old and right"]J;dfloms" protected by the great charter of Englifh liberties (magna charta, c. 3o.) Peculiar privileges were alfo granted them more than Soo years ago, by the flatute of Acton Burnel de inercatoribus, x t Ed. I,and theflatute of merchants, 13 Ed. x. And in the reign of Ed. 3 d. many ftatutes were made for their encouragement, in fome of which, particularly in 27 Ed. 3. c. 19 & 20, the law merchant is exprefsly recognized. In the 13 th Ed. 4. 9, io, (cited by Molloy, book 3 d. c. 7.§. i5.) it is faid that "a merchant ftranger made fuit before c the king's privy council, for certain bails of filk felonioufly taken 4,from him, wherein it was moved that this matter fhould be deter" at common law ; but the lord chancellor anfwered, that this fui
cc is brought by a merchant who is not bound tofue according to the law of
69 the land, nor to tarry the trialof twelve men."
The cuftom of merchants is mentioned in 34 H. 8. cited in Bro. ab. Tit. Clycim Pl 59, -where it was pleaded as a cuftom between mer-

APPENDIX.
chants throughout the 'whole realm, and the plea was adjudged bad, hecaufe a cufloyn throughout the whole reahn 'was the common la-w. And for a long time it was thought neceffary to plead it as a cuffom between merchants of particular places, viz. as a cuftom among merchants refiding in London and merchants in Hamburgh, &c. By degrees, however, the courts began to confider it as a general cuftom. Co. Lit. 182. 2.-1A. 404. And in the time of James ift, Ch. 7. Hobart in the cafe of Fanheath v. Turner, Winch 24, faid, that " the " cuftom of merchants is part of the common iaw, of which the "judges ought to take notice." It was frihlolwever deemed neceffary to fet forth the cuftom fpecially ; and in that form the precedents continued for fome time after. Indeed the pleadings continued in that form long after the courts had decided it to be unneceffary. Lord Coke in his commentary on Littleton, (firft publifhed in 1628,)folio 182 (a.) fpeaking of the lex miercatoria, fays, " which, as hath been faid, " is part of the laws of tis realn." See alfo, 2 IV. 404.
But after this, in the year 1640, in Eaglechild's cafei report,-i in Felty 167. & Lit. rep. 363. 6 C,.r. i. it was faid to have been ruled in B. R. " that upon a bill of exchange between party and party who " were not merchants, there can not be a declaration upon the law cc merchant; but there may be a declaration upon afmupfit, and give the
" acceptance of~the bill in evidence." This decifion feemed to confine the operation of the law merchant, not to contraas of a certain defcription, but to the perfons of merchants: whereas the cuftom of merchants is nothing more than a ruleof congruaionof certaincontrat's. Jac. Law diR. Tomlin. Tit. ctflom of merchants. Eaglechild's cafe, however, was over-ruled in the 18 Car. 2. B. R. (1666,) in the cafe of Woodward v. Rowe, 2 Keb. 105., 132, which was an adlion by the indorfee againft the drhwer of a bill of exchange. "c The plain" tiff counted on the cuftom and law of the realm, that if any man cc writes a bill to another, then if he to whom the bill is dire&ed, 4(do not pay for the value received by the maker, the maker of fuch it bill (hould pay." "It was moved in arreft of judgment, that this cc count is ill, the general cudom being the law ; and it doth not ccappear to the court that there is any fuch law. Sed curia contr , that "4 by the common law, a man may refort to him that received the money, "9 if he, to whom the bill was direded, refufe." It was afterwards moved again that this "is only a particular cuftom among merchants, " and not common law ; butper curiam, the law of merchants is the law
"of the land; and the cuftom is good enough generally fir any man,
" without naming him merchant judgment pro plaintiff, per totam cu-
c riam, and they 'will intend that he, of 'whom the value is faid to be re-
cived by the defendant, 't'as the plaintiff'sfervant." A3

APPENDIX.
The fame principle .was, two years afterwards, recognized in art anonymous cafe (but believed to be Milton's cafe vid. i. Mod. 286.) in the exchequer, reported in Hardres485. .Mich. 2o Car.2d,(1668.) Where the plaintiff declared on the cu.flom of England, and after verdi&,. Offley moved in arreft of judgment, becaufe the " plaintif" " had declared that per confuetudinem Anilix, &c. which he faid was "naught, becaufe the cu/lom of England is the law of England, and "what the judges are bound to take notice of; and that therefore the %cconfuetudo Anglix ought to have been omitted."
But the chief Baron faid, " But for the plaintiffs inferting the cucc tom of the realm into his declaration here, I hold that to the mere c furpluffage and redundancy, which does not vitiate the declaration." And again he fays, " It were worth while to enquire what the courfe - has been amongft merchants; or to dire& an iffue for trial of the " cuftom among merchants in this cafe ; for although we mut' in ge-
"c neral take notice of tthe law of merchants ; yet all their cuftoms we " can not know but by information." Afterwards in declaring their opinions the court faid " that this courfe of accepting bills being a c generalcuflom amongft all traders both within and without the realm, 49and having every where that effed to make the acceptor fubje& to " pay the contents, the " court muft take notice of that cuffom."
Notwithftanding thefe decifions, the queftion was again made about twenty years afterwards in the cafe of Carterv. Downfly, I 1f. and X. anno 1688, 1 Shower 127, in the exchequer on a writ of error from the King's Bench. The defendant had covenanted to pay all bills which fhould be drawn on him in favour of the plaintiff on account of iooo kentals of filu, and the breach affigned was the non-payment of a certainr bill. The defendant pleaded that the plaintiff by indorfement on the bill, according to the cuflom of merchant, appointed the payment to Herbert Aylwin o- his order, who indorfed it to Taffel, to whom the defendant paid it. To this plea there was a demurrer, and joinder. One of the errors afligned was that the defendant had tiot fet forth a particularctydom to warrant the indorfement. To which it was anfwered, " that the law and cuftom of merchants, warrant s the indorfement of foreign bills of exchange, and for that all the " book cafes on foreign bills are a proof; and that fuch indorfement c"doth really transfer the property of the money, or contents in fuch c,bills, to the indorfee, and that all this law of merchants is partof the c law ?f t.e land, and the judges are obliged to take notice of that " as well as of any other law." And the following cafes were cited, 13 1n7f. 182, (a.) 2 Intl. 58, 204- 14. N B. 117.-Reg. 135.-13 Ed. 4, 9.i-4 Rep. 76, Holland's cafe-Fitz. ab. Tit. account, 127.

APPENDIX.
Lord chiefjuflice Pollexfen. "As to that of the law of merchants,. I - think we are botnd to take notice of 'it, as we do of that of furvivor" thip and account, and this is as well known."
Ventrs concurred, and they all inclined to reverfe the judgment; but upon Tremayne's importunity, adjornatur.
Three years after this, however, the point was again made, in the cafe of Mogadara v. Holt, 3 W. and M. i Show. 318, and 2 MOd. . s6. Anno 1699, where it was held by Holt, chief juftice, and the whole court, " that the law of merchants isjus gtntiuin, and part of "9common law, and ergo, we ought to take notice-of it, when fet forth "in pleading. And "cthough the plaintiff hath alleged a cuftom
contrary to fat, yet that is but furpluffage; and he needed not to "have allegeda cuJfom." 7ud. pro quer.
Not fatisfied with thefe adjudications, the queftion was again agitated, two years afterwards, in the exchequer, on a writ of error from the king's bench, in the cafe of Williams v. Williams, Carth. 269. Pafch. . W. and M. Anno 1693, where "the only error infifted on "cwas that the plaintiff had not declared on the cuftom of merchants 44 in London, or any other particular place, (as the ufual way is) but "6had declared on a cujiom throughall England, and if fo, 'tis the com"9mon law, and then it ought not to be fet out by way of cuftom; and
-9if it is a cuftom, then it ought to be laid in fomne particular place ",from whence a venue might arife to try it. To which it was ancc fwered, that this cuflom of merchants, concerning bils of exchange, is "9part of the common law, of which the judges will take notice ex of"gficio. as it was refolved in the cafe of Carterv. Downifh and there#(fore it is needlefs to fet forth the cuftom fpecially in the declaration, "9for it is fufficient to fay that fuch a perfon, fecundum ufum et eonfur"9tudinem mercatorum, drew the bill;. therefore all the matter in the "edeclaration concerning the fpecial cuftc, was mere.y furpluffage, "4and the declaration good without it. Trhe judgment was affirmed."
Similar doarine was alfo held by lord Holt, in the fame term, in the cafe of Hodges ,. Steward, 1a Mod. 37" Pafch. . W. and M. .4nno 1693.
Again in Hillary term, B. R. 8 and 9. W-. 3, Ann& 1697, Pininey v.Hall, Llord Ray. 175, the exception was taken, "9that the decla"ration being per confuetudinem Anglia, &c. was ill, becaufe the cuftorn 1(of Englandis the law of England,of which the judges ouqjt to take "notice without pleading. Sed non allocatur. For thawugh heretofore

372

APPENDIX.

" this has been allowed, yet of late time it has always been over-rul"ted." And another exception was ,i that though lex mercatoria is It part of the law of England, yet it is but a particular cuflom among
" merchants ; and therefore it ought to be fhewn in London, or fome cc other particular place. Sed non allocatur. For the cuftom is not re" ftrained to any particular place.

The fame principles were, in the fame term, in the common pleas, held in the cafe of Bromwich 'v. Loyd, Hlillary term, . I. 3. 2 Lutw. i 8S, where Treby, chiefjriflice, faid " Yhhat bills of exchange at firft ,1 vwere extended only to merchants.rlrangers, and afterwards to inland is bills between merchants trading one with another here in England ; " and after that to all traders and dealeirs, and of late to all perfons, t trading or not : andthere was no occafion to allege any ct/onz ; and that
"c was not denied by any of the other juftices."

In the iotb of W/. 3. Anno 1698, B. R. i lord Ray. 360, Hawkins v. Card), an afion was brought on a promiffory note made by the defendant and indorfed by the payee to the plaintiff for part only, who declared on the cuftom of merchants for fuch an indorfement. But on demurrer it was adjudged ill. "For a man cannot apportion fuch 4( perfonal c6ntra&, for he cannot make a man liable to two aaions, 4c where by contra& he is liable but to one." And Holt, chiefjuftice,
faid " this is not a particular local cuftom, but the cujiom of met chants,
" of which ihe law takes notice ; and therefore the court cannot take,
"the cuftom to be fo."

Judgment for defendant.

Four years after this, in the cafe of Buller v. Crips, i Anne, B. R. 6 Mod. 29, 4nto 17o2, lord Holt faid, " I remember when alions ,4, upon inland bills of exchange did Wirbfegin ; and there they laid a
G(particular cuftom between London and Brj/lol, and it was an f&ion :' ag-.nft the acceptor. The defendant's counfel would put them to "prove the cuflom; at which Hle, who tried it, laughed and faid,
1 they had a hopeful cafe on't. And in my lord North's time it was faid. cc that the cuftom in that cafe:was part ofthe common law of England, "c and the afions fince became frequent as the trade of the nation did ,, ncreafe ; and all the difference between foreign and inland bills is, -t that foreign bills muft be protefted before a public notary, before
"rthe drawer may be charged; bui inland bills need no proteft."

In the yeat 1760, in the cafe of Edie v. the E. India Company, x 0. 3, 2 Bur. 1226, Mr.jtice F/fler faid, "much has been faid about the

APPENDIX.
" cuffom of merchants ; but the cu/iom; of merchants, or law of mer" chants, is the law ofthe kiigdom, and is part of the common law. Peo" ple do not fufficiently difihnguifhi between cufloms of diflerent forts. c The true diftindion is between general cuftoms (which are part of
" the common law) and local cuftoms, (which are not fo.) This cufc tom of merchants is the generallawv of/he kingdom, partofthe common 1 law, and therefore ought not to have been left to the jury, after it has 4" been already fettled by judicial determinations." And in the fame cafe, p. z228, Mr. juftice Wilmot fays, " The crtloyn of merchants is " part ofthe laIw of England; and courts of law muff take notice of it "as fuch. There may indeed be fome queftions, depending upon " cuftoms among merchants, where if there be a doubt about the cqlom, "9it may be fit and proper to take the opinion of merchants thereupon ; " yet that is only where the law remains doubtful.. i ad even there "cthe cuftom muff be proved by fac7s, not by opinion only ; and it " muff alfo be fubjed to the controul of law."
In the cafe of Pillans and Rofe v. Van Mierop and Hopkins, 3, Bur.
1669, lord Mansield fays, " The law of merchants, and the law of the land
," is thefame. A witnefs cannot be admitted to prove the law of mer"c chants. We muff confider it as a point of law."
Sir Matthew Hale, in his hiffory of the common law of England, firff' publifhed -in 1713, 3 d Ed. p. 24, 25, fpeaking of the common law, as it iataken in itsproper and ufual acceptation, fays, " And be" fides thefe more common and ordinary matters to which the com" mon law extends, it likewife includes the laws applicable to divers cc matters of very great moment ; and though by reafon of that appli99 cation, the faid common law affumes diverfe denominations, yet they 9 are but branches and parts of it ; like as the fame ocean, though it "9 many times receives a different name from the province, fhire, ifland, 44 or country to which it is contiguous, yet thefe are but parts of the "9 fame ocean.
" Thus the common law includes, lex prerogativa, as it is applied "t with certain rules to that great bufinefs the king's prerogative ; fo " it is called lexforefle, as it is applied under its fpecial and proper 9c Iles to the bufinefs of forefs ; Jo it is called lex mercatoria, as it is , appliedunder is proper rules, to the bqineft oftrade and commerce."
To thefe authorities will be added only that of Chriflian in his. note ccto i Bl.Com. 75- " The lex mercatoria, or cuftom of merchants, 14 like the lex et confuetudo parliamenti, defcribes only a great divifion of 'c the law Qf England. The laws relating to bills of exchange, infu-

APPENDIX.
" rancc, and all mercantile contrads, are as much the general law~r of c the land,as the laws relating to marriage, or murder."
This chronological lift of authorities tends to elucidate the manner in which the cuftom of merchants gained an eftabliffiment in the courts of law, as part of the common or general law of the land ; and fliews that it ought not to be confidered as a fyftem contrary to the common law, but as an effential conifituent part of it, and that it always was of coequal authority as far as fubjeds exifted for it to a& upon. The reafon why it was not recognized by the courts, and reduced to a regular fyflem as foon as the laws relating to real eftate and the pleas of the crown, feems to be, that in ancient times the queftions of a mercantile nature, in the courts of juftice, bore no proportion to thofe relating to the former fubjeds. Before the time of James if, we have fcarcely a mercantile cafe in the books ; and yet long before that time, the laws refpeaing real eftates and the criminal code were nearly as well undcrftood as they are at this day. Hence' it cannot be a matter of great furprize, that the principles of commercial law which have bcen developed by the exigencies of modern times, ihould have been, by fome, confidered as exceptions from the general principles of the com.non law. The truth feems to be, that the principles of the common law have not been changed, nor innovated upon, by the introdu tion of thofe commercial principles, but that thefe principles have exifted from the earlieft times, even from the rudeft ftate of commerce, and the only reafon why we (1o not find them in the ancient books, is, that the circumftances had never occurred which rendered it neceffary to draw them forth into judicial decifion.
· Another reafon perhaps why " e fee fo much tardinefs in the courts
in -dmitting the principles of commercial law in pra~lice, has been the obftinacy of judicial forms of procefs, and the difficulty of adapting themto thofe principles which were not. juicially eftablifhed until after thofe forms had acquired a kind of fandity from their long ufe. Much of the ftability of the Englifh ju'rifprudence is certainly tote attributed to the permanency of thofe forms ; and although it is right that eftabliflied forms fhould be refpeted, yet it muft be acknowledged that they have in fome meafure obftruded that gradual amelioration of the iurifprudence of the country which the progreffive improvement of the late of civil fociety demainded. It required the tranfcendent talents and the confidence in thofe talents, which were poffeffed by lord Mansfield, to remove thofe obifrutions. When he afeended the bench he found juiliCe fettered in tht forms of law. It was his tatk to burft thofe fetttrs, and to transform the chains into inftruments of fubitantial juftice.

APPENDIX.
From that time a new era commenced in the hiftory of Englifl jurifprudence. His fagacity difcovered thofe intermediate terms, thofe miior pyopofitions, which feemed wanting to conned the newly developed principles of commercial law, with the ancient doarines of the common law, and to adapt the accuftomed f&ms to the great and important purpofes of fubftantial juftice, in mercantile tranfaffions.
II. Forms of pleading often tend to elucidate the law. By obferving the forms of declarations which hawc, from time to time, been adopted in adions upon bills.of exchange, we may perhaps difcover the fteps by which the courts allowed adions to be brought upon them as fubfantive caufes of adion, without alleging any confideration for the making or accepting them. The firif forms which were ufed take no notice of the cuftom of merchants as creating a liability diftind from that which arifes at common law; but, by m:iking iife of fcveral fifions, bring the cafe within the general principles of a&ions of affumpfit. The oldeft form, which is recolleded, is to be found in Raflell's Entries,fol. i o. (a.) under the head "affion on the cafe upon' " promife to pay money." Raftell finifhed his book, as appears by his preface, on the 28th of Vlarch, 1564, and gathered his forms from four old books of precedents then exifting. This declaration fets forth that A. complains of B. &c. for that whereas the faid A. by pt certain I. C. his fufficient attorney, favor and deputy in'this behalf, on fuch a day and year at L. at the fpecial infiance and requeft of the faid B had delivered to the faid B. by the hands of the faid I. C. to the proper ufe of the faid B. f. o 8 4 lawful money of Engla-nd ;for which faid C. i i o 8 4 fo to the faid B. delivered, he, the faid B. then and there to the faid 1. C. (then being the fullficient attorney, fa tor and deputy of the faid A. in this behalf,) faithfully promifed and undertook, that a certain .ohn of G. well and faithfully would content and pay to Reginald S. (on fuch a day and year and always afterward, hitherto the fufficient deputy, fa~tor and attorney 'of the faid A. in this behalf,) 44342 ducats, on a certain day in the declaration mentioned. And if the aforefaid John of G. fhould not pay and content the faid Reginald S. the faid 443- ducats, at the time above 'imited, that then the faid B. would well and faithfully pay and content the faid A.
1C.1io 8 4 lawful money of England, with all damages and interq/1 thereof, whenever he fhould be thereunto by the faid A. requefted. Tt then avers that the faid 443§ ducats were of the value of '. 1o 8 4 lawful money of EiigJand, that John of G. had not paid the ducats to Reginald S. and that if he had paid them " to the faid R. I. B. ;ind " their affociates, or to either of them, then the faid 443 2 ducats " would have come to the benefit and profit of the faid A. Yet the
isfaid B. contriving the aforefaid A. of the faid £ 11 o 8 4 and of

APPENDIX.
" the damages and intereft thereof, falfely and fubtilly to deceive and d4 defraud, the fame, or any part thereof, to the faid A. although of,9ten thereunto required, according to his promife and undertaking cc aforefaid, had not paid or in any manner contented, whereby the "flaid A. not only the profit and gain which he, the faid A. with the Efaid [. i io 8 4 in lawfully bargaining and carrying on commerce
" might have acquired, bath loft but alfo the faid A. in his credit cc towards diverfe fubje~ts of our lord the king (efpecially towards R. "'H. and I. A. to whom the faid A. was indebted in the fum of
i i o 8 4 and to whom the faid A. had promifed to pay the fame
Ito 8 4 at a day now paft, in the hope of a faithful perfor.a" ance of the promife and undertaking aforefaid,) is much injured, cc to his damage, &c. This declaration feems to have been by the indorfee of a bill of exchange againft the drawer. For although nothing is (aid of a bill of exchange, or of the cuftom of merchants, yet the fads ftated will apply to no other tranfae-tion. It appears that ducats were to be given for pounds fterling, this was in fadt an exchange; again, the defendant promifed to re-pay the original money advanced with all danages and interf/ ; this is the precife obligation of the drawer of a bill of exchange, according to the law merchant. Befides, the tranfadion, if literally true as fet forth in the declaration, was at leaft a very uncommon one. A. is fuppofed to make I. C. his attorney for the purpofe of paying [. ioto B. and to receive a promife from B. that John of G. fhould pay to Reginald S. 443 ducats. And A. is alfo fuppofed to have made Reginald S. his attorney for the purpofe of receiving the ducats. buch a tranfadion rfiuft certainly be very rare, efpecially as it was fo much eafier to have done the fame thing in fubftance by a fimple bill of exchange.
In the oldeft books extant in the Englifli language on the fubjed of the law merchant, viz. Malynes's lex mercatoria, written in 1622, and MlIarius's advice, which appeared in 16Sr, it is faid that regularly there are four perfons concerned in the negotiating a bill of exchange. A. a merchant in Hamburgh, wanting to remit money to D. in England, pays his money to B. a banker in Hamburgh, who draws a bill on C. his correfpondent or factor in England, payable to D. in England, for value received of A. But in the declaration above recited there arefive perfons concerned ; and if, as is fuppofed, that tranfadion was upon a bill of exchange, the fifth perfon muft have been an in orfee, or aflignee of the bill. Another reafon for fuppofing this to be the cafe, is, that Raftell has no other form of a declaration by an indo.fee, although he has two by thepayee, viz. one againft an acceptor and one againft a drawer.

In the declaration of payee v. acceptor, fo. 338. (a.) the foreign merthant who paid the 1400 crowns to the drawexr of the bill in France, to be remitted to the plaintiff (the payee) in England, is ftated to be the plaintif's factor; and the drawer of the bill is ftated to be the fa&or of the defendant (the acceptor) fo that the plain%iff, by his factor, is fuppofed to pay to the defendant, through the medium of the defcndint's fa6lor, the 1400 crowns, in confideration of which it is averred that the defendant in England, promifed the plaintiff to pay him C.414, 3 4 lawful money of England.
This declaration Lets forth that whereas the plaintiff on the roth June, 37 Eliz. at Rochelle in France, in parts beyond feas, by the handi of a certain T. S.then the falaor of the plaintiff; at the requeft of a certain R. WV. then the favor of the defindant, delivered and paid to the Laid R. W then the fictor of the defendant, to the ufe of the defendant, as much ready money as amounted to J400 French crowns, of the money of France, in parts beyond fea, at the rate of 5f - lawful money of England for each French crown : And thereupon the laid R. W. at Rochelle aforefaid, then delivered to the faid T. S. three bills of exchange, viz. firft, fecond and third. In the firft of which bills of exchange the Laid R. W. requeaed the defendant to pay to thr plaintiff at L. ;C. 414 3 4 lawiul money of England, at the end of thirty (lays next after fight of that bill of exchange, (the fecond and third bills of exchange to the plaintiff not paid). It then Lets forth the tenor of the fecond and third bills, anid then avers that the defendant, on the day and year firfaftorefaid, at the city of E. in the county of the Laid city, in c97ffideration thereof undertook, and to the plaintiff then and there and faithfully promifed that he, the defendant, well and faithfully would pay to the plaintiff, to the plaintiff's ufe at the city of E. aforefaid in the county of the Laid city, by uway of exchange
according to the ufage of merchants, the aforefaid f-414. 3. 4 lawful
money of England, at the end of thirty days next after fight of any of the bills of exchange aforefaid ; and the plaintiff in fa&t faith, that afterwards, vi2. on the -stSeptember in the year aforefaid, at, &c. the firft of the Laid bills came to the fight of, and was then and there fhewn to the defendant, yet the defendant not regarding, &c. but contriving, &c. did not pay the faid C. 414. 3. 4, &c. at the end of the Laid thirty days,. &e. Whereby the defendant loft the benefit of trading with the Laid C. 414. 3. 4, &c. to his damage £.6oo.
In this declaration it will be perceived that the cuftom of merchants is not alleged as the foundation of the afion, or the caufe of liability of the defendant. Nor is it flated that the defendant accepted the bill But the plaintif grounds his aEUjon uron the defindart * promife ta

pay the amount mentioned in. the bill, in confideration of 1400 crowns. paid to his ufe in France; and in confideration that his fator had drawn and delivered the bills to the plainii/f's facor. This idea oi fadorage is probably a fition introduced for the purpofe of adapting the cuftom of merchants to the common law forms, and to fhow a fufflcient confidcration for the affumpfit. The queftion of fadocrage was not traverfable ; as the fads of drawing the bill, and the drawee's ac-ceptance, were fufficient evidence of the drawers being the acceptor's fa&or quoad hoc. This fi&ion might perhaps be confidered as part of the cuftom of merchants ; but, at any rate, it feems to have been confidcred neceffary in order to create that degree of privity between the payee and the acceptor which at that time was fuppofed neceffary to lupport the adion of. affumpfit.
Both this and the former, are declarations at common law ; that is, neither o them is aided by the cuftom of merchants, unlefs the cuftom may be Gonfidered as fupporting the fidion of fadorage. They fliow alfo that if privily of contra& was neceffary at common law to fupport the adion of aflhmpfit, the law would prefume a "privity, or at lealt would prefume fadfs which conftituted a privity, between the payee and acceptor, or between an indorfee and a drawer of a bill of exchange.
As in the latter declaration, the original advancer of the money ta the dra ,er iii France, is pcfumed to be the fador of the payee, (the plaintiff,) fo in the former, Reginald S. (the payee) and I. C. the original advancer of the money, are prefumed to be the fa6dors of the plaintiff, (the indorfee.)
In i Brownloe's declarationsprinted in 1652 , p. 267, is a declaration by the payee againft the acceptor, in which the acceptor is alleged to be the fador of the drawer, but the original advancer, of the money is not ftated to be the fador of the plaintiff, as in the declarations in Raf. tell ; although it is averred that the original advancer of the money paid it. to the drawer with intent that it fhotuld be paid in England by the drawer's fadlor (the drawee) to the plaintiff (the payee) which is the fame thing ; for if he paid it with that intent, it was paid for thQ benefit of the payee.
In the fame volume p. 269 is a declaration by payee v. Drawer, in which the advancer of the money is exprefsly flated to be the fa"or of the plaintiff; but the drawee is not alleged to be the fadftor of the drawer. In both cafes the cuftom is flated to be between Englifhi. nerchlants and foreigners, and theirfacorsorfervants.

AT ENDIX.
"Probably at this time it began to be confidered as unnecelary to aliege the intermediate parties oil the bill to be the fav1ors of the parties to the adion, in as much as it was a mere fifion, the want of which was confidered as fupplicd by an allegation of the cuftom.
But in his ftcond volume, printed in 1654, p. 58, there is another declaration by the payee v. acctptor of a bill of exchange, in which the payee is called the fa6tor of the advancer of the money, and the elrawee the faaor of the drawer. There is alfo an averment of the cuttom. This declaration refers to lititary term, 4 .7ac. Roll 155, from whence it was probably taken.
In Browne's vade mecun, (2d Ed. 1695,) p. 12, is a declaration by payee v. acceptor, alleging that the plaintiff himfelf paid the money to the drawer who was the defenuant's fa~tor. It alfo fets forth the cuftom.
itp. 16, is another by payee againift acceptor, like that in Raflell, fol. 338, (a) alleging that the plaintif's fa6tor beyond fea, paid the money to the dfendant's fattor, who drew a bill on the defendant (his mafter,) payable to the -plaintiff, who fhowed and delivered it to the defendant, who in conriderationthereof, promifed to pay, &c.
This is a declaration at common law, and not on the cuftom. The date of the bill mentioned in the declaration is Sept. io, 1584, (26th of Eliz.) one year before the date of that in Ratell.
In p. 18, is another declaration at common law by payee v. acceptor of a foreign bill, in the cafe of Wiilianfun v. Il/liday, Trin. 9. jac. Rot. 712, in which it is alleged that the plainif by his favor paid the money to -the defendant's favtor, for which he drew on the defend:ant payable to the plaintifl, who fmowed it to the defendant, who ac. cepted it, and in coiderationofthepremifes promifed to pay, &c.
In p. 19, is a declaration by payee v. drawer, in which the plainijf declares that he paid the dfe'ndant [.45 ,for which the defendant drew and delivered to the plaintif, a bill of exchange on a certain Thomas Cole, at Venice, requiring him to pay to the plaint/ff for the defendant, 2oo ducats, at 2 days fight ; aid in confideration of the pre..
mi/is undertook and promifed that he would, by the hands of the fid
Thomas Cole, in Venice, pay to the plainifl the faid 2oo ducats. He then avers that he fhowed the bill to Cole, who refufed to pay, yet the defendant had not, by the haids of the fiid Cole, nor in. any other manner paid the ducats, &c.

APPENDIX.
Inp. it, is a declaration at common law by the original advanCer of the money to whofe ufe the money was to be paid by way of exchange, againft the drawer. It alheg, s that the plaintiff paid the defendant at his requeft, £. oo, lawful money of England, for which the defendant drew a bill on I. W. 'at Middleburgh, requiring him to pay at ufance, to one George Chandler, or bearer, to the ufeof the plaintif C. 174 11 o Flemith; and that in cotiderationof thepremnq/es the defendant undertook, &c. that if the faid 1. W. fhould not accept the bill, nor pay the £. 174 1 1 o Flemifh, according to the tenor of the bill, then the defendant would pay the plaintif the original fim advanced, viz. £. too, lawful money of England. It then avers, that I. W. did not accept nor pay ; and a proteft for non-acceptance and notice to defendant ; yet he has not paid the L. too, &c.
Thefe are the greater part of the precedents of declarations on bills of exchange, to be found in the printed books before the ftatute of Anne; and in all of them thofe fa6s are flated which bring the cafe within the principles which were confidered as neceffary to fupport the affion of affumpfit in general cafes at common law. In the more fModern forms the liability of the defendant under the cufiom, is coniidered as a fufficient confideration to raife an affumpfit without avering thofe intermediate fteps which may be confidered as the links of the chain of privity which conneCts the plaintiff with the defendant. The reafon of this change of form was probably the confideration that thole intermediate links were only fiffions, or prdfumptions of law, which were never neceffary to be Rated.
Thefe authorities tend to fhow, that in mercantile tranfa&ions privity is not neceffary to the' foundation of an affion , or that if it is, the law will prefume a privity. It will be feen in the courfe of thefe obfervations that privity is not neceffary to-fupport the a~tion for Jnotley had and received, in any cafe.
III. Having thus feen how the law merchant was underfood at the time of e ftatate of Anne, and the manner in which it was applied to the forms of judicial procefs, it will now be necefary to enquire at what time the law merchant was confidered as applicable to inland bills, and what was the law refpedingftch bills and promiffory notes, pri0r1 7o. the ftatutes of 9 and i c W. 3, c. 17, and 3 and 4 Anne, c. 9,
It is not afcertamned exaCtly at what time inlandlills firft came into iife in England, or at what period they were firft confidered as entitled to the privileges of blls' of exchange under the law merchant. But there was a time when the law merchant war confider'd as "confined

"' to cafes %fkcre one of the parties was a merchant ftranger," 3 Wcdefill 109, and when thofe bills of exchange only were entitled to Its privilcges, one of the parties to which was a foreign merchant. This feems to have been the cafe at the time when Malynes wrote his leo mercatoria, in the 4 th page of which he fays " He that continually
"ealeth in bu).ng and felling of commodities, or by way of permutcation of wares, both at home and abroad in foreign parts, is a mer-
" chant." It may be obferved alfo that Malynes takes no notice f inland
tkds ; hence we may prefume that they were not in ufe in his time. -ie dates his preface to the lex mercatoria, on the 2 5 th of Nov. 1622, and fpeaks of his book (p. 5,) as the fruit of .co years experience. Marius (p. 2,) fays, that "' Mr. John Trenchant, in his book of arithmec tick, printed at Lyons in Anno t6o8, ebferves, that an exchange " made in the fame realm, is not real." In the cafe of Brownwich v.
Loyd, 2 Lutwv. 1585, (Hill. 8. W. 3. C. B.) chief juffice Treby faid " that bills of exchange at .ftrfl were extended only to rer.hantr Jirangerstrading with Englifh merchants; and afterwards to inland bills between merchants trading one with another here in England; and after that to all traders and dealers, and of late to all petfons trad-
ing or nt." And in B2dler v. Crips, 6 Mlod. 29, (2 Anne,) lord c hief juffice Holt faid, he remembered ," when ations upon inland ,' bills of exchange firft began."

Perhaps lord Holt might have been corredl as to the t -nz -,-hen a~tions upon inland bills irft began, or rather when the firft notice was taken of a difference between inlandand foreign bills; but it appears probable that inland hills were in ue much before lord Holt's
remembrance. Marius firif publitied his advice concernir'g bills of exchange in 165 i, half a century before lord Holt fat in the cafe of
Buller v. Crips, as appears by Marius's preface, to his 2d edition ; and he there fays he has been 24 years a notary public, and in the pra&ice
of protefting " inland infiruments and outland inftruments." In p. 2" fpeaking of a bill between merchants in England, he fays, it ( is in " all things as effedtual and binding as any bill of exchange made be" yond feas and payable here in England, which we ulfe to call an
" outland bill, and the other an inland bill." If we go back 24 year .
from 165 i, the time when Marius firft publiihed his advice, it will bring us to the year 1627 ; but if wc go back 24 years f-o!" 167', the probable date of his 2d edition, (which wYas probably hit, meaning)
it will give us the year ,646, as the earlieft date to which we cam trak',-
them. * As Malvncs in his lcx nnca oria, of 1622, does not notiCe them, and as Marius mentions them as exifting in 1646, it fcms probable that they began to be in uf- between thofe two periods. Kyd, in his treatife on bills, p. 13, ()ublin edition, 179',) fpcaking of pr-.

.nybry notts, fays, '" the period of their introduffion appears to hi. " been about 30 years before the reign of queer? Anne ;" but the only authority he cites is 6 A1od. 30, (2 Anne,) the cafe of Buller v. Crips, above mentioned, in which lord Holt fays, he had confulted two of

-the moft famous m,'chants in London, who informed him that " it
" was very frequent with them to make fuch notes, and that they
" looked upon them as bills of exhange, and that they had been ufcd
4'for a nza/ter sf 30 years." This expreffion, it will be obferved, does

not reflri6f the period to that limit, and it is probable that 30 years was a Iodft expreffion, and as far back perhaps as thofe merchiints -could carry their recolleffion of any mercantile tranfadion. It is

,certain that promiffory notes were in ufe upon the continent in thofe

commercial cities and towns with which England carried on the greateft trade, long before that period ; and'were negotiable unlde'r the cuftom of merchants in the countries from whence England

adopted the greater part of her commercial law. They were called
bills obligatory, or bills of debt, 'and are defcribed with great accuracy by Malynes in his lex tnercatoria, p. 71, 72, &c. where he gives the
form of fuch a bill, which is ccpicd by .Molloy in p. 447, ( 7 th edition London, x722,) and will be found in fublifance exaffly like a modern promi7bry note. (I, A. B. merchant of Amflerdam, do by thefe 44 prefents, acknowledge to be indebted to the honeft C. D.

In p. 72, fpeaking of thefe bills obligatory, he fays, " The fince" rity of plain dealing hath been hitherto inviolable in the making of " the faid bills, which every man of credit and repuitation giveth of ' his own hand writing, or made by his fervant, and fubfcribed by
him, without any feal or .witnefs thereto; and is made payable to " fuch a merchant or perfon, or to the bearer of the bill, at fuch times ' of payment as is agreed.".,
As M alynes fays nothing of inland bills, and yet is fo very particular reipccing promni.ry notes, the probability is that the antiquity

APPENDIX.
qf the latter is greater than that of the former, and that they were more certainly within the cuftorn of merchants. Indeed there is a cafe prior to any in the book,, upon inland bills, which is believed to have been brought upon fuch a promifibry note, or bill obligatory, as is defcribed by Malynes. It is 'in Godbolt 49, (Mich. 28. 29. Eliz. 1 Anno t586,) " An a&ion of debt was brought upon a conceflit fi/. " vere, according to the law merchant, and the cuftom of the city of 4 Briflow, and an exception was taken, becaufe the plaintiff dI not " make mention in the declaration of the cuftom ; but becaufe in " the end of his plea he faid 'Aproteflando, fe fequi quere/amfecundunk Ic-confuetudinein civitatis Briflow," the fame was awarded to be good ;r
" and the exception difallowed."
Lord Ch. Baron Comyns in his digeft, Tit. merchant, F. i. F. 2. in -abridging the fubftance of what Malynes had faid upon this fubjcel of bills of debt, or bills obligatory, does not hcfitAte to flate the law to, be that " payment by a merchant fhall be made in money or by bill. " Payment byjbill is by bill of debt, bill of credit, or bill of exchange. c A bill of debt, or bill obligatory is, when a merchant by his 'wriling " acknowledges himfelf in debt to another in fuch a fum, to be paid at " fitch a day, andfui-f!.ibes it at a day and place certain. Sometimes.a "4al is put to it. Butfitch bill binds by the cjlom of merchants, with-
" out feal, wilnjfs or delivery. So it may be made payable to bearer, " anti upon demand. So it is fuffieient jf it be made and fubfcribed " by th merchant'sfirvant. So a bill of debt may be agned to ano"6 ther toties qties. And now by the flat. 3 antI 4 Anne, 9 all notes in "' writing made and figned by any perfon, or the fervant or agent," &c. reciting the terms of the ftatute.) By thus arranging his quotations from Malynes under the fame head with the flatute of Anne refpe&ing promiflbry notes, it is to be inferred that he confidered the cuftom of merchants refpefIing bills of debt, as ifated by Malynes, to be the caufe or origin of the flatute refpecting promiffory notes.; and by connefing the former with the latter by the corjunc'tion ,, and," it feem. to be flrongly implied, that he confidered t/e/latute only as a confirmation of what was law before. That he was corred in this opinion, .and that the foreign cuftom of merchants refpetfing promiffory notes mentioned by Malynes was gradually and imperceptibly engrafted into the Englifh law merchant at theJame thne, anti under the fame fan~lion with ini'andbills, and that that cuftom was acknowledged repeatedly by folemn legal adjudications in the Englifh courts before the ftatute of Anne, will probably be admitted when the authorities are examined which will be prefented in the following pages. A greater degree of weight will be attached to the opinion of Comyns, when it is recolret[ed that he was either atthe bar er on the bench during the reigns of

APPENDIX.
K. W. 3, Queen Anne, Geo. i, and Geo. 2, and muft therefore have kiown how he law ftood before the ftatute, what motives produced it, gnd what was the true intent of the parliament in pairing it.
An&fon, in his hiqory of commerce, relates a number of fa&s whiclt may throw fome light upon this fubjed.
In vol. i, p. 171, fpeaking of the great antiquity of bills of exchange, he mentions a charter granted by the emperor Barbaroffa to the city of Hamburghanno 1189, in which one of their rights is "cto negotiatemoney c by exchange." He obferves alfo, that bills of exchange were very new at this time in Europe, and were then in ufe only in the moft confiderable commercial cities. In p. 204 he fays, that re-exchange, by way of damages, was firft invented by the Ghibelines, when driven out of Italy by the Guelphs; and in p. 274, bills of exchange were known in England anno 1307, about the laft year of the reign of Ed. i, anid are alluded to in the ftatutes of 5 th R. 2, c. 3, anno 1381, and 14 R, 2, c. 2, anno 1390. rhey are alfo mentioned anno j4o6 and are called litere Cambii. Hence it appears that for a perigd of nearly 350 years the cuftom of merchants refpe&ing bills of exchange was confidered as confined to foreign bills, and it is now upwards of i5o years fince it has been allowed toextend to inland bills.
The time when inland bills and promiffiry notes began to be in general ufe in England was probably about the year 1645 or 1646 ; and their general ufe at that time may be accounted for by the fa&s ftated in Andeijon~s h47. of comnerce, vol I.p. 386, 402, 484, 492, 493, 519 and 520.
In the year 1638 or 164o, King Charlesforceablyborrowed. 2oo,ooo of the merchants of London, " who had lodged their money in the ot King's mint in the tower, which place, before banking with goldct fmiths came into ufe in London, was made a kind of bank, or repofi" tory for merchants therein fafely to lodge their money ; but which, 4' after this compulfory loan, was never truited in that way any more."
c,Afterwards they generally trufted their cafh with their fervants, ,,4 until the civil war broke out, when it was very cuftomary for their i apprentices and clerks to leave their mafters, and go into the army. 4 Whereupon the merchants began, about the year 645, to lodge their 4C cah in goldfmiths' hands, both-to receive and pay for them ; until sc which time the whole and proper bufinefs of London goldfinith, St wai to buy and fell plate and foreign coins of gold and filver," &c.

APPENDIX.
" This account," fays Anderfon, " we have from afc irce and moj
i4 curiousfinall pamphlet, printed in 1676, entitled " The wrmery qf tbe 4'nw-fafbioned gohtmithf, or bankers, d fovered, in.eight quartopages," from which he extrl&s the followirg paffage. " Such merchants' fer1 vants as fill kept their mafter's running carh, had fallen into a way 4 of clandeflinely lending it to the goldfmiths at 4 pence per cent. per " diem ; 'who by thefe and fuch like means, were enabled to lend out c great quantities of cafh to neceffitous merchants and others, weekly " or monthly at high intereft ; and alfo began to difcount the mer" chants' bills at the like or an higher rate of. intereft. That much. " about this time, they (the goldfiniths or new fafhioned bankers) be" gan to receive the rents of gentlemen's eflates -entitted to town, and " to allow them and others, who put cafh into their hands, fome in" tereft for it, if it remained a fingle month in their hands, or even
a leffer time. This was a great allurement for people to put their " money into their hands, which would bear intereft tjll the day they 6 wa'nted it ; and they could alfo draw it out by/" I oo, or[/'. 5o , &c. 1 at a time, as they wanted it, with infinitely lefstrouble than if they " had lent it out on either real or perfonal fecurity. The confequence
" was that it quickly brought a great quantity of cafh into their hands ; "c fo that the chief or greater part of them were now enabled to fupply " Cronwellwith money in advance on the revenues, as his occafions 6 required, upon great advantage to themfelves.
- After the reftoration, King Charles being in want of money, they "took ten per cent. of him barifacedl, ; and by private contr& on ma-
ny bill, orders, tallies and debts of that king, they got 2o, fometimes 30 per cent. to the great dithonor of the government. This d great gain ihduced the goldfmiths to become more and more lenders c to the king ; to anticipate all the revenue i to take every grant of c parliament into pawn, as foon as it was given ;'alfo to outvie each " other in buying and taking to pawn, bills, orders and tallies ; fo that "in effe& all the revenue' paffed through their hands. And fo they " went on till the fatal fhutting of the exchequer, in the il 572."
The banking trade was at its greateft height in 1667, when the Dutch burnt fome fhips at Chatham. But that difafter caufing a run ori the bankers, it in fome meafure leffened their future credit, which was entirely ruined by the flutting up of the exchequer, five years after; by which they were prevented from drawing out the money weeekly, as it came in, fo as to anfwer the demands upon them. The confequence was their failure for nearly a million and-an half flerling, which fum they were in advance to the king.; anathe ruin or injury of Ioooo fLmilies.

APPENDIX.
This hort hiftory of the goldfwiths will 'account for the fuddea increafe of paper credit after the year 1('45, and renders itextremely probable that inland bills and promiffory notes were in very general ufe and circulation. Indeed, we know that to be the fa& from the cafes in the books; upon examining which we flball find that~therc was no dflinlTion made between inland bills of exchange, and promiffory notes; they were both called bills ; they -were both called notes; fometimes they were called." bills or notes." Neither the word " inland" nor the word "pronzylbry" was at this time ihufe, as applied to diflinguifh the one fpecies of paper from the other. The term " promdflbry note" does not feem to have obtained a general ufe till after the ftatute. There was no diftin&ion made, either by the bench, by the bar, or by merchants, between a promiffory note and an inland bill, and this is the caufE of that obfcurity in the reports of mercantile cafes during the reigns of Charles 2d, James 2d, and K.. William, of which Lord Mansfield complained fo much in the ciafe of Grant and Vaughan, 3 Bur. 1525, and i W'. BI. 488; where he fays, that in all the cafes in K. William's time, " there is great conitfifon ; for, without fearching the record, one can not tell whether
they arofe upon piorniffory notes, or inland bills of exchange -" " for the reporters do not exprefs themfelves with fufficient precifion, "tbut ufe the. words " note" and "bill" promifcuoufly." This want of preciflon is apparent enough to us who now (fince the decifion of Lord Holt in t!.e cafe of Clerk v. Martin,) read the cafes decided by him before that time ; but at the time of reporting them there was no Wast of precifion in the reporter, for there was not in fa&, and never had been fuggefted, a difference in law between a promiffory note and an inland bill. They both came into ufe at the fame time, were of equal benefit to commerce, depended upon the fame principles, ani were fupported by the fame law.

Without doubt many had preceded it, and paffed fub filentio. The cafe was this: A butcher had bought cattle' of a grazier, but not having the money to pay for them, and knowing that the patron of 'the parifh had money in London, he obtained (by promifi .g to pay for it) the parfon's order or bill on his conefpondent, a merchant in London, in favour of the grazier. The parfon having doubts of the credit of the butcher, wrote fecretly to his coirefpondent not to pay the money to the grazier'until the butcher had paid the parfon. In confequence of which, the.London merchant did not pay the draft, and the grazier brought his fuit againrft the parfon and declared on the

t1ftom of merchants. It was moyed in arreft of judgment thAt neither the drawer nor payee was a merchant. But it was held to be fufficien that the drawee was a merchant.

Next came the cafe of Woodward v. Row, Mich. 18. Car. 2.. .A4,uo 1666. 2 Keb. Io5. 132, in which the court faid that " the " law of meichants is the law of the land, and the cuftom is good cc enough generally for any man, without naming him merchant; and
they zvill intend that he of 'wom the value is scid to be received by the Sde'lfndant was the plainti 's servant."
The next is Mfilton's tase, Mich. 2G. Car. 2. Hard. 485, of which it may be neceffary to take notice, as it has bcen confidered as a lead-ing cafe, and as having eftablifhed fome principles upon which a number of fubfequent cafes have been decided. It was an aCion of debt in the exchequer upon a bill of exchange accepted. The plaintiff declared that by the eom of England, if a merchant fend a bill of exchange to another merchant to pay money to another perfon, and the bill be accepted, that he who accepts the bill does thereby bece-me chargeable with the fum there'n contained; and that a certain met, chant drew a bill of exchange npon the defendant, payable to the, plaintiff, which bill the defendant accepted , per quod afio acerevit. Upon nil debet pleaded, the vetdi6t was for the plaintiff. A motion was made in arreft of judgment, and one of the reafons afligned wa that there was " no privity between the plaintiff and defendant," 44 nor any contrat in deed, or in law."

The chief Baron, among other things, fiid that "without doubt it
49 the common law, or the cuftom of the place, create a duty, debi " lies for it; as in the cafe of a toll due by cuftom; 2c. H. 7. 1. and
.3 in cafes of a certain fum due by cuflom for pound breach to the z lord of the manor, or to a goaler for barfees, v. H. 7. But the
- great queftion herels, whether or no a debt or duty be hereby raifed ; " for if it be no nmore than a collateralengagement, order or promife, - debt lies not, as in the cafe that has been cited, of goods delivered " by A. to B. at the requeft of C. which C. promifeth to pay for if - the other does not ; for in that cafe a debt or duty does not arife beC twixt A. and C. but a collate-al obligation only. In our cafe the 91acceptance of the bill amounts clearly to a promife to pay the Mo.. c ney ; but it may be a queftion whether it amounts to a debt or not."

Precederts were ordered to be fearched ; but none being foun4, the court afte;wards, in Hill r), term, 2o, 2i, C. 2, declared their opi-
nions, " that an action of debt would not lie upon a bill of exchange

APPENDIX.
,accepted, agaiift the acceptor; but. that a fpecial afion upon the 9 cafe muft be brought againft him, For the ax'ceptance does not create " a ditty, no more than a promife made by a flra nger, to pay, &c. if " the creditor will forbear his debt. And he that drew the bill co." tinues debtor, notwithftanding the acceptance, which makes the " acceptor liable to pay it. And this courfe of accepting bills being 49a general cuftom among all traders both within and without the " realm, and having eyery where that effe& as to make the acceptor c liable to pay the contents, .the'court muft take notice of that cultom; " but the cuflom does not extend fo far as, to create a debt ; it only "5makes the acceptor onerabilis to" pay the money. Though cuftom c may give an affion of debt, as in the cafe of toll "and fo in cafe of " a fine for a copyhold.
'cc Wherefore, and becaufe no precedent cotld be produced, that an. " a&ion of debt had been brought upon an accepted bill of exchange, "judgment was arrefted."
The ground of this judgment feems to be that the drawver is the original debtor, and that the undertaking of the acceptor is only to pay the drawer's debt; and thereforef is a collaterlaland not ;,original engagement. If the court were miftaken in this pofiton, the cafe is not
law ; or at leaft the reafon of the cafe fails. It may be true that the drawer is the original debtor until the bill is accepted; but after the bill is accepted the acceptor is the original debtor, and the undertaking of the drawer is collateral, viz. to pay,-in cafe the acceptor does not. The, queftion in the cafe cf Heylin and A4damfon; 2 Bur. 674, was, who was the original debtor in a bill of e~change. I.nrd Mansfield faid,
a bill of exchange is an order or cofinmand to the drawee, who has, " or isfuppofed to have, effeds of the drawer in his handd, to pay. - Wher, the drawee has accepted, he is the originaldebtor." .If fo, a. duty is certainly created by the aceptance, and according to the ch. Baron's own admiffion ,9debt liesfor it." -In the .fame cafe of He'lin ·v.Adamfon, lord Mansfield ftates ihe law to be the fame refpeding the maker of a promii )ry note, as the acceptwr of a bill of exchange ; yet it has been held in the cafes of Rumbald v. Bal, jo Mod. 38, Rudder and P, ice, x.H. 1. 547 and Biop v. rotuvo. 2 Bos and Pul. 78, that debt lies againft the maker of a promiffory note. See alfo Chitty enbills, 22o,where the authority of the cafe in Hardres 485, is doubted.
The next cafe is that of Brown and London, reportedin i Pent. 15 i Lev. 298, 1 Mod. 285 and2 Kb. 695, 713, 726, 758, 822, (Mfich. 2- Cgf. 2. anno 1670) inwhich it was decided, upon the authority f Miton's 'ye, Hard, 485, that indebliatus ofundt would not lie pon

APPENDIX.
1he acceptance of a bihl of exchatge. This cafe was not decided on tie. groV'ld ot 'want of privit,, becaufe it is faid by the court, that " if A. " delivers money to B. to pay to C. and gives C. a bill of exchange " drawn on B. and B. accepts the bill, and doth not pay it, C. may c bring an indebitatus ajfumpfit againif B. as having received money to his " fe: but then he muft not declare only on a bill ofexchangeaccepted, as " the cafe at bar is." And in the cafe of Rables v. Sikes, at the famc term, 2 Keb. 71 r. Such a declaration of indebitatusafanpJt for money had and received in cafe of a bill of exchange, was adjudged good upon demurrer.
The cafe of Bakery. Hill (Paq'h. 28, Car. 2) 3 Keb 627 is the next
which occurs in the books. rhis is faid by the reporter to be " Debt " on inland bill by cuftom of merchants." This appears to be the firft cafe in which the term "sinlandbi" is ufed, but it furnifhes no evidence that the cafe was not up'n a promifibry note ; for it will be obferved by any one who will take the trouble to examine the cafes prior
to the judgment in the cafe of Clerk v.' Martin (f Aline.) that the term promi/ory note Was not in ufe, nor had they any technical name by which to diftinguifh a promiffory note from an inland bill of exchange, unlefs it was by calling the former an inland bill, and the'latter an inland bill of exchange. In the cafe of Baker and Hill, the circumftance of its being an affion of debt, induces a fufpicion that it was a promiffory note, becaufe we have already feen that in the cafe of a bill of exchange, it had beendeqided in Hard.485, that an a~lion of debt would not lie.
In the next cafe, which is " again? Elborouqgh," Pq/fh. 28, Car. 2, 3 Keb. 765, it feems doubtfut whether it was a promfliory note, or an inland bill of exchange. It is a thc'rt note of a cafe in thefe words, " In aCtion upon the cafe on cuft3m of London, that any merchant or ,,other inhabitant therefuif'ribinga noteftrpaynientof mory to any other, " not faid where inhabiting ; on defaut of payment by him on 'whom dt the bill is drawn, fhould pay, &c. lhonpjon exceptedl in arreft ot ic judgment, that no a~tion lieth as between merchants it doth fed " non allocatur, forper cur'iam there is as much reafon for ;nend bills as "for bills of exchange' and this is no more, and being averred that the
defendant is an inhabzitant in .L. &c. judgmeilt for the plaiitiff."
The cafe of Shelden v. Hentley, , Shovw. 161, (33,Car. 2, B. R. awi i68o) was " upon a note underfeal, whereby the defendant promifled
, to pay to the bearer thereof, upon d'i'very of i/e n2te, 1. ioo, anmd 49 avers that it wa6 delivcred to him, .(cauingthe dfefidaat) Iw th "cbearerthereof, and that he (the riaiint ) was' fo."

APPENDIX.
It was objcded that this was no deed becaufe there was no perfo* named in the deed to take by it. But it was anfwered that it was not -adeed until delivered$ and then it was a deed to the plaintiff.
" Court. The perfon feems fufficiently defcribed at the time that 'tis G made a deed, which is at its delivery : and fuppofe a bond were cc now made to the lord Mayor of London, and the party feals it, and " after this man's mayoralty is out, he delivers the bond to the fubfecc quent mhyor, this is good ; et traditiofacitchartam lhqui. And by
the delivery he expounds the perfon before meant ; as 'when a iner" chant proinfes topay to the bearerof the note, any one that brings the note (Jha!l be paid. But Mr. juftice Jones faid it 'was the cuJlotp of merchants cc that, made that good." Here it will be obferved that the court, in order to elucidate the fubjed before them, refer to principles of law more certain and better known, viz. that a promiffory note payable to beare'r is good, and that promiffory notes, were within the cuftom of Merchants.
Then followed the cafe of Norfolk v. Howard, Trin. 34, Car.2, B. R. anno 1681, 2 Show. 23 5, which was " cafe upon fp cial promife .44 on a note wherein the defendant promifedtopay unto theplaintf''. 5o ," at any time during the joint lives of plaintiff and defendant, within " 3 months after the plaintiff (hould demand 'the fame; and no de" mand modo etfon-ma pleaded." The demand proved was by plaintiff's attorney who delivered a demand in writing at the defendant's houfe to his maid, by whom it was fent up to the defehdant, being ick and not to be fpoken with ; the maid brought down word ihe had delivered it to her mafter ;-held no good evidence to maintain the ua'ion, for the demand ought to be perfonal. No objedion was madc to the form of the a&ion;. it was only to the fufficiency of thr deiwand.
The next cafe is Hintons (Mich. 34. Car. 2. Anno 1681.) 2 -Sow. 23 5, which is faid to be, ", Cafe on a bill of exchange againit the " drawer, Bill not being paid, and payable to I. S. or to the bearer; - the plaintiff brings the aCtion as bearer; and upon evidence ruled by " the lord Pemberton, that he muft intitle him*felf to it on a valuable ,9 confideration, though among bankers they never make indorfemnents " in fuch cafe ; for if he come to be bearer by cafualty or inavery, cc he fhall not have the benefit of it." It does not appear that this is not an aCtion on a promiffory note. It feems to have been either a banker's promiffory note or a check drawn on a banker, and at this time no difference was fuppofed to exift as to the law in thofe, afes. But it expreffes a clear opinion that the bear~r of fuch a note or 'ill

APPENDIX.
may maintain an adion in his own name, if he camevairly by ihe bill, Arid although this principle was denied in the fubfequent cafes ot, Horton and Coggs, Hodges and Steward; and Nichofon and Sedg wick yet thefe again were exprefsly oVer ruled and denied to be law by lordt Mansfield and the ieft of the judges in the cafe of Grant v.Viughan, 3. Bur. 15 16 ; in which cafe the reafoning of the court applies as Urongly to the cafe of a promift6ry note as ty that of an inland bill bf exchanfge.
In th cafe of Claxton v. Swift in tle exchequer on a writ of error, (Hill 36, 37. Car. 2. Anno 1684.) t Lut. 878, it was decided, upon an ifiland bill, " that the firft drawer of the bill and every indori,fer is liable to the payment of a fum certain, to the laft indorfee." No difference was then taken between an inland bill and a promiffory inote. Both were confidered as being within the cullom. So that what is ilated to be law as to one may be, conlidered to be law as to the other.
In the cafes of .Cram/ingtonand Evans (T. 3. Jac. 2,) 2. Vent. 296. -and Eoers v. Benehkin (Pif. 4. Jac. 2.) 1. Lut. 231, the pleadings are f-t forth at large, and fhew the manner of delaring upon the cufaom as to inland bills.
The cafe of>L)arrachv. Savage (Paf'h. 2. W. andM. Anno 1689) i. ,Sh& . 15S , was " indebitatus affumpJit for [. 40 received' to the "'plaintiff's ufe. Non afunpfit pleaded ; and upon the trial, the evi4,dencc was a bill of exchange or note under the defendant's'hand, da" ted the.' 22d February 1687, dire&cd to a merchant in London, pray " pay to Mr. Darrach or his order the fum of /.40 and place it to " my account, value received, witnefs my hand."
This cafe fliews that a bill or note was good evidence on an ,6fion for money had and received; and thatno diffinc'tion was made between a bill and a note.
1ortovn. Coggs. (Mich. 2. IV. and M. C. B. Anno 1689) 3. Lev. 299, was clearly upon a promiflbry note, yet in the margin it is called " c/ufirmpftfur bill d- exchange." The plaintiff " declared upon " a cuftom in London, that if any merchant or other perfon, merchan- dizing in London, make a note in writing under his hand and there, by promife to pay any.furm of money therein contained, to apelfon thereinl" named or b.arer; and if the perfon in the note named, to whom by " the note it was promifed to be paid, afign or deliver it to any other ·'pexfon to receive it to his o9,n%ufe, and he bring it to the drawer

APPENDIX.
" of the note and requeft him to pay it to him who brings the note, " then the perfon who made the note was chargeable to pay it to the " bearer. And that the defendant being a goldfmith, made fuch a: " note, thereby promifing to pay ,r. too to William Barlow, or the " bearer ; and that Barlow delivered the note to the plaintiff, to re" ceive the money to his own ufe, in fatisfaffion of [. too, due to c him-by Barlow ; and that the plaintiff brouight and fhowed this to " the defendant, and requefted him to pay the £. 1o, which he had c not done, whereby, by the cuftom, he became chargeable, and fo
being chargeable affumed to pay. After verdiC* for the plaintiff, it " was moved in arreft, &c. that this cuftom to pay to bearer was too "general; for perhaps the goldfmith, before notice by the bearer, had. c paid this to Barlow himfelf. (And this was at bar now alleged to " be the truth of the cafe.) And of fuch. opinion, after divers mo" tions in Hillary term, and this term, were Pollexfen, Powell and ( Rookfby. Ventris being dead in the laft vacation. Although upon " the trial of the caufe before Pollexfen at Guild-hall, he then held " that the aCtion well lay, this matter being objeded at the trial. Le-
vins of counfel for the plaintiff."
In this cafe the only objeffion was ihat a cultom to pay to bearer was too general. It feems to be admitted that Barlow himfelf might have brought an 2Ction upon the cuftom ; and that a cuftom to pay to order or to indorfee would have been good. It is a fufficient anfwer to this cafe, that in the cafe of Grant % Vaughan, 3 Bur. t516, it' was declared. not to have been law, fo far as it decided that an affion Gould not be maintained by the bearer of fuch a note in his own name.
The cafe of Dehers v. Harriot, (T. 2. W. and M.) i Show. x63, was this-tg A. draws a firft and fecond bill of exchange payable by c himfelf in Dublin, to B. or order," who indorfed to the plaintiff. No queftion was made as to this being a bill of exchange ; and yet it diffiers in nothing but in form from a promiffbry note.
The next cafe is Hodges v. Steward, (Pafc'h. S. W. and M.) reported in Comb. 204. Salk. 125. 12 Mord. 36, ind Holt 15.' The cafe ig thus fhortly ftated by Comberbach. "Cafe upon a bill of exchange: " Cuttom was laid in London, that where a bill is payable to A. or
bearer, it muft be paid to the indorfee. Holt, chief juftice, faid it " was repugnant . for another perfon, and not the indorfee, might " be the bearer." This feems to be the true ground of the decifion, although the reafons are varioufly flated by the different reporters. They all call it a bill of exchange, but in 12 Mod. 36. we are iriformed what kind of a bijll of exchange it was, viz. A bill drawn by the

APPENDIX.
defendait on luiif/lf, payable to another or learer. The payee indorfed it, and the indoifee asfuch, and not as bearer, brought the 'ction, which was held not to lie ; becaufe no authority was given to the payee to indorfe, or to transfer it by indoifement. And in i Salk. 125, it appears that in the fame cafe a difference was taken between a bill payable to bearer, and to order; for a bill payabie to "I. S. or bearer " is not aignable by the contrail fo as to enable the indoifec to bring ".an adion ; becaufe there is no fuch authority given to the party by "the firfl contracT." " But when the bill is payable to 1. S. or orier, " there an expros power is given to the party to a Tgn, and /& ijdorl'e " may maintain an akion,"
It was alfo faid that although fuch an indorfement is not a good iffignment of the bill fo as to charge the drawer; yet it is a good bill between the indorfer and indorfee; and the indorfer is liable to an a&ion for the money, "for the indoif'ment is in nature of a ne'w " bill." It was alfo held, (as it had been before adjudged in Milton's cafe, Hard. 485, and in Brown and London's caf', i Vent. i52,) that a general indebitatus aampf/t would not lie on a bill of exchange, but that the a&ion muft be dither a general indebitatus aq.-nPit.for mbney had and received, or a fpecial adion upon the cafe grounded on the cuftom. Upon this cafe it may be remarked that a bill drawn by a man on himfdf, is precifely a promiffory note in effe& ; and IovClafs in his treatife on bills and notes, p. 22, exprefsly fays, " that the "9law c6nfiders a promiffory note in the light of a bill drawn joy a " man upon himfelf; and accepted at the time of drawing." Martus alfo in his advice, p. 3, fays, "' a bill may be by two perfons, as where " the drawer makes the bill payable to himfelf or order," fo where a man draws a bill on himfelf. The fame is faid by Kyd, on bills, p. 2, and Chitty, 22, 48, fays, " a bill will be valid where there is only .9 one party to it, for a inan may dratv on hinfiflf, payable to his own di order; but in fuch cafe it is faid that the inftrument is more in the ' nature of a prontiory note, than a bill of exchange."
The next cafe is that of Hill et al. v. Lewis, (H. 5. W. and M. B. . Salk. 13 2. This was an adion by the holder agaihft the in-
dorfer of two notesfubfcribed by one Moore, a goldfmith, payable to the defendant and by himindorfed in blank, and delivered to one Zouch, to whom he was indebted. Zouch delivered them fo indorfed to the plaintiffs, and received from the plaintiffs therefor other bills and fome cafh. One of the notes was payable to the defendant or.order, the other was payable to the defendant without the words 6f or order." Moore.broke and ran away ; the plaintiff decltred, i ft, upon two bills ?f ex:change againft the irdorfer; 2dly, upon a mutuats ; 3 dly, uPoI)
D 3

APPENDIX.
an indebitatitsalumpf]t for money !aid out for the ufe of the defendant, And the principal queftion was, whether the plaintiffs had ufcd due diligence in applying to Moore for the' money. Holt, chief julice, held
" Thatgoldfmiths' bills 'weregoverned by thefame laws and cujioms as other " billosf exchange ; and every indorfement is a new bill: And fo long as
cc a bill is in agitation, (circulation) and fuch indorftments are made, Ccall the indorfers and every- of them are liable as a new drawer., That
by the law generally, every indorfe" is liable as thefirfl drawer, and can "not be difcharged without an adual payment; and is not difcharged " by the acceptance (receipt) of the bill by the indorfee ; but by the " cuflom this is reflrained, viz. the acceptance (receipt) is intended to
" be upon this agreement, fc. that the indorfee will receive it of the "firf drawer if he can, and if he can not, then that the indorfer " will anfwcr it; as if the firft drawer be infolvent at the time of the " indorfement, or upon demand refufes to pay it, or cannot be found. " And the indorfer is not difcharged without adual payment, until
" there be fome negle. or default in the indorfee, as if he does not " endeavour to receive it in convenient time, and then the firfi c drawer becomes infolvent." " He left it to the jury to cqnfider, " whether the tim. in this cafe were convenient time or not ; and if
c the plaintiff had convenient time to receive his money, then to find , for the defendant, otherwife for the plaintiff. And they upon corn9,fideration found for the plaintiff; upon which the plaintiff prayed to ,,take the verdi& upon the indebitatus alumpfit. Et per chiefjuflife, - You 'can not take the verdid upon any part of the declaration but " ihat to which evidence was given, and hereit 'willlbegood iff~imnd upon t,the bills ofexchanie ;but if the evidence be applicable to any other part I of the declaration, you make take it upon any fuch part to which the 't evidence is applicable. And becaufe Zouch had fworn that he re" ceived the benefit of., and had been fatisfied with the bill he took of -the plaintiff, by which the defendant was difcharged againft Zouch, " the verdi&l was taken upon the indebitatus ajlfhmpft for money laid c out for the defendant's ufe; and it feemeth the indorfement by the - defendant to the plaintiff was good evidence of a requeft to pay the c faid money to Zouch. Now, exception was taken that one bill was cc payable to the defendant only, without the words "or hr order," ccand therefore not affignable by the indorfement; and the chief juf" tice did agree thatthe indorfement of this bill did not make him that " drew the bill chargeable to the indorfee ; for the words "or to his
order, give authority to the plaintif to afign it by indotfement ; and 'tis It an agreement by the fljr drawer that he would anwf.er it to the afTgnee:
" but the indorfement of the bill which has not the words " or to his " order" is good, or of the fame effe& between the indorfer and the
indorfee, to make the indofer chargeable to -the indorfee." This cafns

APPENDIX.
oertaiidy ought to hav& been confidered as fettling the law upon promiffory notes. Lbrd Holt here admits .that promiffory notes are It go,4 vened by the fame laws and cujioms as other bills of ex. h.ange ;" and that if the verdia had been taken upon the count which declared upon the notes as bills of exchange it would have been good. His reafons %vhya note to order is affignable, viz. " that the words, or to his 6 order, give authority to the plaint? to fign it by indoifenment ; and that " 'tir an agreement by thefirjlr drawer that he -would aifwver it to the af"fignee," are certainly good ; and are the fame which were ufed in feveral modern cafes which will be noticed hereafter. The obfervation is alfo important cc that the indorfement by the defindant to the plaint( If was good evidence of a requij? to pay the money to Zouch." We fhall have occafion to refer to this cafe again when we come to confider the cafes of Clerk and Martin, and Buller and Crips, decided about nine years afterwards.
The cafe of PearonandGarretoccurred in the next term anno 1693, and is reported in Comb. 227. and 4. Mod. 242. " 1 he affion was
brought upon a note for the payment of fixty guineas when the (le"fendant flould marry fuch a perfon, &c. in which the plaintiff de-
clared as upon a bill of exchange fetting forth the cuftom of mer" chants," &c. This note appears.by the declaration, which is ftated at length 4 AMod. 242, to be dated 2ift Odober, 4 th W. and M. by 'which the defendant "promifid to pay to the plaintiff or his arfigs fix" ty guineas in two months after the defendant fhould be lawfully " married to one Elizabeth Pretty."
It was obje&ed that this was " only an agreement founded upon a ' brokage, and therefore not within the cuilom of merchants ; nei" ther were there ever yet any precedents to p,'y money upon fuch a At collateralcontingency." The j udgment was for the defendatt ; and
it was faid that, , f the note had been given by way of comerce it had
It been good ; but to pay money uponfuc.h a contingency cannot be called ," trading, and therefore not within the cuftom of merchants."
If any doubt could remain that the cafe of Hill and Lewis had fully fettled the law that promiflbry notes were within the cuftom of merchants, that doubt muft have been completely removed by the cafe of Williams v. Williams, decided at the next term in the fame year in the king's bench (viz. Pafch. 5. IV. and M. Anno 1692,) Cartheu 269. c The plaintiff rhomas Williams being a goldfm-nith in Lombard ftreet, -. brought an adion on the cafe againft Jofeph Williams, theprqiec96 tor of the diving engne, and declared upon a note drawn by one

APPENDIX.
, Jokin Pullin; by which he promifed to pay . 12 o o to the faidt ' Jofeph WVilliams on a day certain; and he indorfed the note to one
Daniel Foe, who itidorfed it to the plaintiff for like value received. , And now' the plaintiff, asfecond indorfee, declared in this manner, " viz. " that the city of London is an ancient cit, and that there is, , and from the time to the contrary whereof the memory of man doth " not exiit, there hath been a certain ancient and laudable cuflom " among merchants and otherperfons refiding and exercifing commerce "11 within this reahn of'England,ufed and approved, viz. &c. So fets forth 11 the c/oin of merchants concerning notes fo drawn and indorfed tit
"fupra, by which the firf indorfer is made liable as well as the fecond,
" upon failure of the drawer, and then fets forth the fa& thus, viz. " And whereas alfo, a certain John Pullin, who had commerce by "way of merchandizing, &c on fuch a day. at London aforefaid, to
wit, in the parifla of bt. Mary le Bow, in the ward of Cheape, ac. -c" cording to the ufage and cultom of merchants, made a certain bill " or note in writing, fubfcribed with his name, bearing date, &c. " and by thefald bill or notepromifed topay, &c. fetting forth the note; " and further, that it was initorfed by the defendant to Foe, and by oe
.to the plaintiff, according to the ufage and cuftom of merchants; and , that the dra%er having notice thereof, refufed to pay the money,
whereby the defendant, according to the Ufage and cuflom of mer" chants, became liable to the plaintiff, and in confideration thereof
promij d to pay it, &c. alleging that they were all perfons who Actraded by way of merchandize, &c.
" To this the defendant pleaded a frivolous plea, and the plaintiff "demurred; and upon thefi;jl opening of the matter had judgment in B. " R. And now the defeniant brought a ''rit o/ error in the exchequer
chamber, and the only error infifted on was, that the plaintiff had not " dclared on the cuftom of merchants in London, or any other par-
ticqlar place, (as the ufual way is) but had declared on a cuitom throughall England,and if fo it is the conimsn law, and then it ought "not to be fiet out by way of cujom; and iYit if aetu/lom, then it ought " to be laid in fome particularplace, from Whence a venue might arife "9 to try it.
" 1o which it was anfwered that this cufl om of merchants con" cerning bills of exchange is partof the coimntn lZeaq, of which the -' judges will take notice ex offlc, as it was ref,.lved in the cafe of "c Carterv. Downih, and therefore it is needkfs to fet forth the cuf" torn fpccially in the declaration, for it is fuficient to fay that fueh fl a perfon, according to the uJfie and cuflom f merchants, drew the bill; ,' fherefore all the matter in the tieclaration concerning the fpecial

APPENDIX.
" cuftom was merely furpfuffage, and the declaration good without "it.
"The judgment was affirmed."
There cannot be a ftronger cafe than this. On demurrerjudgment was rendered for the plaintiff in the King's bench, which judgment was .firmed upon argumdnt, upon a writ of error in the exchequer chamber, on the very point of the cuftom ; fo that here was the unanimous -concurrence of ail thejudges of England. . This cafe, it is believed, has never been denied to be law, either before or fince the ftatute of Anne.
A fhort note of this cafe is to. be found in 3 Salk. 68, by the name of Williams v. Field, in thefe words, " Rule'd, that where a bill is " drawn payable to W. R. or order, and he indorfes it to B. who indor"fes it to C. and he indorfes it to D. the laft indorfee may bring an ac49 tion againft any of the indorfers, becaufe every indorfement is a new "' bill, and implies a warranty by the indorfer that the money ffi~ll be Mp' aid."
The next cafe upon a promiffory note is that of Bromwich v. Loyd, (Hill 8, W. 3, C. B. anno 1696) 2 Lut. 1582, where the pleadings are fet forth at full length, in which the plaintiff declares t&at (4at " London aforefaid, viz. in the parifh, &c. there is a cuftom that if "any merchant or othqr perfon refiding and trading at London, make "any note with his proper hand fubfcribed, and thereby promife to "pay to any other perfon dwelling at London, any fum in fuch note 1' fpecified, then fuch perfon who fubfcribed fuch note, by reafon " thercof, and by the faid cuftom is liable to pay. the money, &c.. " That the defendant, 8th June 1696, refiding and dealing at London, ' made a note, &c. and thereby promifed to pay to the plaintiff at
it London aforefaid in the parifh and ward aforefaid refiding, L. 26.
*' iO. 9 on demand, by reafon whereof, &c.
" To this the defendant pleaded that at the time of making the faid " note, .he was refident at Brantford, &c. qbfque hoc, that he was refi-
a dent at London. To which plea the plaintiff demurred, for that the
"9 defendant had traverfed matter not traverfable, and becaufe it tended " to the general iffue," &c.
It was urged for the defendant, that the cuftom was laiddn St. Mary le Bow, but in fa t is extended to London, and was therefore contradit ory. Sed non allocatur " forper curiam, the .parifli is mentioned

"but in refpecl of the venue, and that it was matter of neceffity to al. lege it fo."

And it was furtheri faid for the defendant, " that there were three "things neceffary to mainiain the af-ion, viz. t. commorancy, 2. The cc making of the note, 3. Commerce between the parties ; but there
is no place mentioned in the declaration where the note was made ; fed non allocatur, for it flall be intended at the parifh of St.
" Mary le Bov; for it is faid, that the defendant at London qforefaid in
Sthepar/b and ward aforefaid, refiding and ufing commerce, made a " note ; and therefore the whole is to be intended at the fame place.

" It was alfo objeded that the cujlom was unreafonable, becaufe it took v4 away theproofhow the money became due; but the court were of opi,9 nion that the cuflom was good notwithflanding this objetion.
"t Treby, chiefjufl ce, faid in this cafe, that bills of exchange at firft "were extended only to merchant Avangers, trading with Englifh "' merchants, and afterwards to inland bills betw en merchants trading ," one with another here in England ; and after that to all traders and " dealers, and of late to allperfons tradingor nt ; and that there was no "occafion to allege any cuftom ; and that was no! deni-d by any of the " otherjuflices. And the chief juftice alfo faid, that bills of exchangi. " were of fuch general ufe, and benefit, that on an indebitatus ajump40fit, a bill of exchange may be given in evidence to maintain the a~on ; "and Powe~l, juflice, faid, that on a general indebitat'us afunpit for
1nmmey received to the ife of the plaintfi, fuch bills may be left " to the jury to determine whether it was for value received or not. "4In Hill, 9 and 'o, W. 3 the plaintiff had judgment by the opinion "c of the whole court." This cafe is in perfe& conformity to thofe of Hill and Lewis, and Williams and Williams.
The cafe of Pinckney v. Hall (Hill, 8 and 9, W. 3, ann 1697, B. R.) i lord Raymond, 175, was by the indorfee of a promiffory note made by the defendant for himfelf and partner as joint merchants to Hutchins or order, and by him indorfed to the plaintiff. The declaration
was on the ctuom ofEngland,to which the defendant demurred.

ift. " Becaufe the declaration being per cotfetudinem Anglie, &c. " was ill, for the cufom of England is the law of England, of which "9 the judges ought to take notice without pleading. Sed non allocatur.' * For though.heretoforithis has been allowed, yet of late time it has * always been over-ruled, and in an afion againft a carrierit is always

di law of Englaud, yet it is but a particularcujiom amongmerchants, and "therefore it ought to be ihewn in London or forne other particular, "place. Sed non allocatur; for the ctuom is not rejirainedto any parti' cular plane." Two other exceptions were taken which are not material to the prefent queftion : butjudgment was given for the plaintiff
At the next term (Eafler9, W. 3) 1 Lord Raymond, 8do, occurred the cafe of Nichofon v. Sedg-wick, reported alfo in 3 Salk. 67, where it is fiated"to be upon a,bill.
"The defendant Sedgwick, being a goldfmith, made a note in wri"ting by which he proinifed to pay to one Mafon, or to the bearer "thereof f . too. Mafon delivered the note to the plaintiff for 4.ioo "'in value received," who brought the adfion as bearer and declared upon the " cuftsm of merchants and others trading 'within this realm."
tUpon non afumpJit pleaded, and verdid for the plaintiff, ,, it was "moved in arreft of judgment that this ation could not be brought " in the name of the bearer, but it ought to be brought in the name " of him to whom it was made payable. Z od fuit conceofm p.r cu" riam ; for the difference is, where' the note is made payable to the "1 party or bearer, and where it is payable to the party or order; in " the latter cafe the indorfee has been allowed to bring the aaiionin his own ctncre." -The prin'cipal point of this cafe, viz. that the bearer could not maintain an a&ion in his own name, was exprefsly declared not to be law, .in the cafe of Grant v. Vaughan, 3 Bur. 15 L6.
In the fame year in the cafe of Boulton v. Hilhfden, Comb. 450, it was decided that a mafter may be bound by a promiffory note made by his fervant.
Another cafe in the fame year is cited in i Com. Dig. 19o , 19j, by. the name of Oromwell v. Floyd, in C. B. which does not feem to have been reported, unlefs it be the fame cafe with that reported in 2 Lut. 1582, by the name of Bromwich v. Loyd; which is not impoffible.
.In Mich. term of the fame year, in the cafe of Woolvil v. Toung, etal, 5 Mod.'367, it was held that a declaration upon a promiffory note, founded on the cuftom of England, was bad, becaufe it did not allege that the defendants were commercium habentes; but it feems to admit ,thatit would have been good if thofe words had been ufed.
h an anoymous cafe in chancery, in the fame year, reported by Ch. Baron Comyns, p. 4., it is faid that the iindorfee for a valuabli

APPENDIX.
" confiderationrecovered in indebiaus 4117mifit on this bill of eze " change, agaiiift the drawer. The drawer filed a bill in chanccry" c to be relieved againi this judgmnt.at law, alleging that he received '1no i'alue; and that the indorfee might refort to the indorfer for his c original claim. It was anfwered that the drawer might be relieved ccagainri thepayee, or any claiming as fervant or fador of, or to the ·' ufe of the payee : but the chancellor held that the indorfee being 9 an honefr creditor, and coming by this bill fairly, for.the fatifcc fa&ion of a juft debt, he would not relieve againfi him, becauf. it 9(would tend to defiroy trade which is carried on every where by bills C of exchange, and he would not leffen an honeft creditor's fecurity."
It may be doubted whether this was really a bill of exchange or a promiffory note.; and perhaps it is immaterial whith it was,. as the law had been clearly fettled to be the fame upon both. Yet if it had been a bill of exchange it feems probable that fomething would have been faid of the drawee; by which it fhould appear that the plaintiff· had a.right of action againft the drdwer; fuch as that the bill had been prefented for acceptance, and refufed or that being accepted by the drawee, he lhad refiifed to pay, &c.
The cafe of the bant-of England v. Nevman, !2 Mlod. 241. B. R
i lord Ray. 442, and Coyns rep. 57, was upon a promiffory note, drawn by one Bella.my, poyable to Newman or bearer, who difcounted it at the bank without indorfing it. Upon Bellamy's failure the bank brought fuit againfi Newman. But the court held him. not to. be liable, " for the law is, that if a bill or nte be payable to one or " bearer, and he-negotiates the bill and defiers it for ready money
paid to him, without any inlorfement'on the bill, this is a plain "blying of the bill; as of tallies, bank-bills, &c. but if it be indo~frd, " there is a remedy againf the indotfer."
Havkins v. Cardy, in the next year, (Mich. io. IV. 3. B. R.) T Lord Rayrn. 360. i Salk. 6S. 'Cartb. 466, was alfo upon a promiolbry note. " The plaintiff brought an adion on the cafe upon a bill 4'f exchange," ( fays the reporter,) " againif the defendant, and de49 dared upon the cuffom of merchants, which he flhewed to be thus: " that if any merchantfulbfcribes a bill, by which he promifes to pay a furn " of money to another man or his order, and afterwards the perfon " to whom the bill was made payable, indorfes the faid bill for the
ppayment of the whole* fum therein contained,, or any part thereof, " to another man, the firfi drawer is'obliged to pay thefiimfoinqorfed, "to the perfon to whom it is indorfed payable; and then the plaintiff i fhews that th defendan;, being a merchant, fubfcribed a bill of

APPENDIX.
". 46 19 o payable to Blackman or order; that Blackman indorfed " [-43 4 o of it, payable to the plaintiff," &c.
On demurrer, the declaration was adjudged ill; " for a man cam C not apportion fuch perfonal contrac ; for he cannot make a man "liable to two actions, where by the contract he is liable but to one."
"But if the plaintif had acknowledged the receipt of the [. 3 15 o the
" declarationhad been good."
And " Holt, chief j/)ice, faid, that this is not a particular local cuftom, 'but tt c Lommon e/lonm of merchants, of 'which the law takes
,i,je.
Salkield in reporting this cafe, begins thus, " A. having a bill of cc exchange upon B. indorfes part of it to I. S. who brings an acion " for his 'part," &c. This, compared with Jord Raymond's report of the cafe, fhews what has been already fo often mentioned, that no difference had yet been difcovered between the law refpefing promiffory notes, and that concerning inland bills of exchange. Even lord Raymond ftates it firft to be a bill of exchange, and immediately fhows it to have been a promiffory note. So glaring a contraditlion could not have paffed uncorre&ed, if a promiffoty note and an inland bill of exchaige had not been confidered, as the fame thing.
In this cafe it will be remarked, that upon demurrer, the court faid that this declaration, upon the culomn of merchants, on a p omi otV note, by the indorfee aga.iry? the maker, would have been good, if the receipt of the L. 3 15 o had been acknowlcdged.
The next year produced the cafe of Lambert v. Oakes (Pafch r C' W. 3. B. R.) reported in i. !'rd RIF. 443- i. Salk.. 27, by the name of Lambert v. Pack. i Salk. 126. cafe 6,'Anonymous. 12 lod. 244. and Holt i i8. This cafe was clearly upon a promiflbry note, although four out of the five reports of lihe cafe call it a bill of exchange. This circumftance fliows that no difference was underflood to exift at that time between a promiffory note and an inland bill of exchange; for upon this fuppofition only can we account for the extreme inacctiracy of fo many reporters upon that point. The fak of its being called a bill of exchange induces alfo a firong prefumpt;on of another faa which does not exprefsly appear in Lord Raymond's report of the cafe, and that is that the plaintiff grounded his ation on the cuflon of.merchants, which was at that time the only known and eftablifhed form of declaring upon ' pr~miffory inote. This was then an a&ion by the indorfee againft the indorfer of a promiffory note, pav-
F3

APPENDIX..
abre to defendant 'or order, grounded on the cuflom of merchants, in which it was decided that the plaintiff .muft demand the money of the drawer of the note, before he could refort to the indorfer ; and is another ftrong cafe to fhow that promiflfry notes and inland bills of exchange, before the ftatute of Anne. were precifely on the fame footing.
The cafe of Starke v. Cheefinan, in the fame year, Carth. 5o9. was upon a bill of exchange drawn by the defendant in Virginia upon himfeg'f in London, which, as has been before obferved, is in effe&. a promiffory note. Th plaintiff had judgment, although he had not alleged in the declaration that the defendant promifed to pay the money after proteft, or even. that he had notice of the proteft, for "the, c"law did raift the promife upon the cujlom of merchantaand therefore it i"was not neceffary to lay an a4ual promife."
In thenext year, (Pafch. 12. IV%3.. Anno 17oo, B. R.)we findthe cafe of Carterv. Palmer, reported in 12. Mod- 380.
cc Palmer had given a note under his hand in this form: c Ipromire cc tpay the BEARER/o much money on demand."
cc Plaintiff brings his a&ion grounding it upon the cuftom of mer11 chants, as if it were a bill of exchange ; and avers no confideration. "tAfter Verdi&, upon motion in arreft of judgment, Holt, chiefjufct rie, "We will take fuch a note ptima.facie for evidence of money "9-lent; and though they have declared on the cuftom, yet we mut take "ccare thvt by fuch a drift, the law of England be not changed, by d making all notes bills of exchange." " But all feemed to agree if it "'were made payable to him or order, the defendant by thatform had if made it negotiable, and by cofiquence he would be liable to the aaion of ccaffgnee in his owun name; for if a man who is no merchant will cc drw a bill of exchange, he is fuable upon it according to the cuom of "c merchants, for he makes hiinfelf a merchant, pro tanto. And inland cc bills were not known till tradegre. to a greatheight ; and when they obctaiited, they received theJame law 'with OUTLANDISH bills : and he faid " he remembered that at a trial upon an inland bill before Hale, the " defendant's counfel would put the plaintiff to prove the cuftom; 4 but Hale faid they had a hcpeful point of it. Et adjorn."
It does not appear that this cafe was finally decided, but the principal point, viz. that a bill or note payable to bearerwas not:'a bill of exchange, had been before dtccided in the cafes of Horton and Coggs,
odger.and.Stezard, and Nichl fn .v. Sedgwick, (before cited). But

APPENDIX.
Ohefe cafes, as before obferved, were exprefsly denied to have been law, by Lord Mansfield and the other judges in the cafe of Grani v. Yaughan, 3. Bur. 1516.
The other point' of the cafe,- viz. that if the note had been made payable to him ororder, the defendant, by thatform, had made it nego-
tiable, and the affignee might have fued in his own name, is in ftritk
analogy with the whole current of authorities from the time of the *irft introduction of promiffory notes ; and the reafon given is the fame with that ufed in the cafe of Grant and Vaughan, viz. that the defendant by the orginal contraa had made it negotiable, and had made himfelf exprefslv liable to the aftion of the algnee. The further reafon given by 'the court fhows moft clearly that a promiffory note payable to order was an inland bill of exchange ; " for, fay the court, c' if a man who is no merchant will draw a bill of exchange, he is fua- ble upon it according to the cuftom of merchants, for he makes " himfelf a merchantpro tanto."
There was another fimilar cafe at the fame term, between Jordan and Baroe, 3. Salk. 67, where it is faid to be ",ruled that where a - bill is drawn payable to W. R. or order, 'tis within the cuflom of mer4' chants; and fuch a bill may be negotiatedand afflgned by cuflom, and " the contrag of the parties; and an afion may be grounded on it, , though 'tis no fpecialty; but if 'tis made payable to W. R. or bearer, cc 'tis not within the cuftom'of merchants; and therefore, when upon
fuch a bill, the plaintiff declared, that the defendant being a mer" chant, had drawn a bill according to the cultom of merchants, but -9 had not paid the money, this declaration was held ill."
Although the inftrument in this cafe is not exprefsly ftated to be a promiffory note, yet it feems ftrongly implied trom the vxpreffions ufed. For it may be remarked, ift, that it appears by all the reports of the time that the words bill and note were fynonymous; that the term promiflory note was not in ufe, and that generally whenever the term bill is ufed alone, it meant a promiffory note.
2dly. It is faid that " a bill payable to W. R. or order, was within "the cuftom of merchants." It was furely not necelffary at that time to have decided folemnly that a bill of exchange was within the cuftom of merchants.
3 dly. It is ftid that " fuch a bill may be negotiated and affigned 4'by cuftom and the contrafl of the parties, and an a6ion may be

APPENDIX.
ccg.rounded on it, though 'tis no fpecialty;" which laft exprellion feem, more.apjg able to a promiffory note, than to a regular bill of exchange."
4 -hly, It is faid that "the defendant drew a bill, but had not paid 4 .the maney;" without naming any drawee, or a non-acceptance or non-payment by the drawee, or any other circumftance to fhew that the drawer was liable to pay the money.
Sthly. The points decided are precifely thofe mentioned in the pre,. ceding cafe 6f Carter v. Palmer.
In the cafe of Crawley v. Crowther, 2 Freem. 25'7, (Trin. 1702,) in chancery, it was faid, that "it is now likewife held, and the pracit tice is fo, that if a man gives a note for money, payable on demand, 4"he need notprove any confideration."
Lawon v. Lamb, (Hill. 12. W. 3. C. B. Anno 1700) i Lut. 274, was another cafe upon a promiffory note by affignee of payee, a bankrupt, agaioft the maker of the note. The pleadings are fet forth at large', and it appears-that the plaintiff declared upon the culom of mer¢hant:.within the realm of England, upbn a note payable to the bankrupt or order.
"The obje'ion to the declaratiorj was, that all the proceedings of the commillioners of bank, upt ought to be alleged at large; but by " reafon of divers precedents accordingto the declarationhere,judgment eper tot. cur' was given for the plaintiff."
In Trin. term of-the fame year, it is faid by Comyns, in hi: digefl,p. x91, of vol. ', that in the cafe of Butcher v. Swift, in B. R. it was duub.'ed, whether a promiffory note to A. or.order, was within the cuftom of merchants, and whether the affignee could bring an aclion upon it in his own name. This cafe, it is belicved, has not been reported.
In i Salk. 183, Fordv. Hopkin, (Hill. 12. W. .3") lord Holt is reported to have faid at nyfpirius, " that goldfmiths notes to pay mo-
ney~or tickets, are *evidenceof the receipt f.money." As he had be-
fore faid that every indorfement makes a 'new bill, it feems to follow that an sndorfemint is alfo evidence of the receipt of money.
We have now examined all the rep'orted cafes upon promiffory notes, from the time of the firft introduiion of inland bills, to the time of lord Holt' decifion in the cafe of Clerke v. Martin. At leaft, if iny

APPENDIX.
others are to be found, they have efcaped a. diligent fearch. They form a feries of decifions for a period of more than 30 ycars, in which we difcover an uncommon degree of unanimity, as well as of uniformity. We find the law clearly eftablifhed to be the fame upon promiffry notes as upon inland bills.; and we find no evidence that the latter were in ufe before the former.
There is not a contradidory cafe, or even diRum, unlefs we confider as fuch the doubt expreffed iii the cafe of Butcher v. Swift cited by Comyns ; but that cafe is not reported, and therefore it is impoffible to fay upon what q'ound the doubt was fuggefted. The cafes upon promiffory notes and inland bills, go to eftablifh not only their likenefs in every refpe, but even their identity ; for the former are almoft uniformly called inland bills.
V. Upon examining the printed books of precedents during the above period, we flall find that the common ufage was to dc lare upon a promiffory note as upon an inland bill of exchange.
The firft precedent of a declaration upon a promiffory note is that in Brownlow latine redivivum p. 74, which is prior to any of the declarations upon inlhnd bills of exchange. It is in fubftance as follows, that there is and was from time immemorial a "cuftom among merchants at the-city of Exeter, and merchants at Crozi&, that if any merchant-at Crozit fhould make any bill of exchange, and by the faid bill fhould acknowledge himtfe/fto be indebted to another merchant in any fum of money to be paid to fuch other merchant or his order, 'and fuch merchant to whom the fame Thould be payable, fhould orderfucb'fum' to be paid to another merchant, and fuch merchant to whom the fame was payable fhould requeft the merchant who acknowledged hinifelf fo as aforefaid to be indebted, to pay fuch fum to fuch other merchant to whom he had ordered the money to be paid ; and if upon fuch requeft the merchant who acknowledged himfelf to be indebted in the fum in fuch bill and ind6rfenaent mentioned, fhould accept thereof, then he would become chare'eable to pay the faid Cum to the, perfon to whom it was by the faid bill and indorfement direaled to be paid at the time in the faid bill mentioned, according to the tenor thereof. It then avers that on the 8th May i678, the. defendant according to the cuflom aforefaid, ackno~wledged imfe/f to be indetedto one M. M. in 5-2s.whichhe obligedl,;,nfe/fndhi. f ns (this is probably mifprintcd) to pay to the faid M. M. who by indorfement on the fame bill ofex. chang,'on *-at ordered the money to be paid to the. plaintiff, which bill of exc~hange afterwards, to wit, on at the defendant faw and accepted, by which acceptance and by the ufage aforefaid the

406

APPENDIX.

defendant became liable, &c. and in confideration thereof promifed to pay, &c.

There is in the fame book p. 77, a declaration upon a bill of exchange at double qjuance, which i4 probably upon an inland bill, as the cuftorn is alleged generally among merchants, but does not fay at what place.

The next declaration on a promiffory note is in the cafe of Horton v. Coggs, 3 Levinz 296. The note is dated ift O6ober, 4 Jac. 2. The cuftom is alleged to be in London, that if any. merchant or goldfmith in London (hould make a billor note in writing, with his Pame fubfcribed, and thereby promife to pay to any perfon or bearer, &c.

In Clift's Entries 918, is a declaration upon an inland billof exchange, calling it a note, and the word bill is not mentioned in the whole count. This flhows that the words bill and note were confidered as fyn6nimous.

In the fame book 899, Turner-. Toj] is a declaration by the indorfee v. the maker of a promiffory note dated 6th November 1684. It ftates that within this realm of England, viz. at the city of Briftol, there is and from time immemorial has been a cqlom among merchants, &c. ufed and approved, viz. that if any merchant or other perfon ufing commerce, &c. make any note under his proper hand and thereby promife topay to any other merchant, &c. in the fame note mentioned, or to his order, any fum of money at any time in fuch note fpecified; and fuch merchant, &c. to whom or to whofe order the 'fame is payable, &c. by indorfement of the faid note, appoint fuch fum of money in the note mentioned, to be paid to any other merchant, &c. in the faid indorfement mentioned, or to his order, then fuch perfon who fub-. fcribed fuch note, having notice of fuch indorfement, is chargeable, and for the whole time aforefaid hath been accuftomed to be chargeable, to piy the fum of money in fuch note mentioned, to the perfon in fuch isdorfement mentioned, at the time in fuch note limited for the payment thereof, according to the tenor of fuch note. It then fets forth the fa&s to bring the cafe within the cuftom, by reafon of which, and of the culom aforefaid the defendant became liable, &c. and
fo being liable in confideration thereof promifed to pay, &c.

The next precedent is in the cafe of Sheppard and Bragg v. Flemyng
(Mich. 5 W. and U1.) Clio. Ent. 929, Indorfees v.Maker. "Whereas "t the faid Flemyng on 28th Otober 692, at, &c. according to the it cuftom of merchants in that cafe ufed and approved, made his cer-
" tain bill in writing, and the fame bill with his proper hand fubfcribed, " and by the faid bill promifed to pay to one George Mafon or order, the

APPENDIX.
4'tum of £. 40 upon the 28th day of November then next following, c for value received, and whereas the faid George Mafon afterwards, c viz. on at by indorfement with kis proper hand fubfcribed "tupon the faid bill according to the ufage and cuftom of merchants " aforefaid in that cafe ufed and approved, appointed the contents of c the faid bill to be paid to the faid William Sheppard and Jofeph " Bragg, by the name of William Sheppard and company, in the faid " indorfement named, whereof the faid Flemyng then and there had "notice, by reafon of which premifes and by the cuftom of merchants i in that behalf ufed and approved, he was liable, &c. and being fo c liible, in confideration of the premifes, promifed to pay," &c.
In Clift. Ent. 916, in the cafe of Gilb's admx. v. Fowle'and Wooton, is a declaration upon the cuftom of merchants, by adminiftratrix of the payee againif the mafter, upon a promifibry note made by his fervant, dated 29 th May, 1693. See a/fo j .lWntworth'sfyflem of leading 346.
In p. 914' inthe cafe of Dymes v. Smith (Mich. 8, W. 3.) is a declaration on the cuftom, by the payee againft the mafter upon a like note made by the fervant, 7 th Mlay 1696. And in p. 913, in the cafe of Wifeman v. Conyers, is another, upon the cuftom, by the indorfee againft the maker of a promiffory note, dated 4 th May 1686.
In 2 Mod. Intr. x26, is another declaration upon the cuftom by the indorfee againft the maker of three promiffory notes, dated in 1697. This declaration isprecifely like a modern declaration upon a promiffory note, excepting that the note is called a bill, and is faid to be made and indorfed " accordingto the ct1/lom of merchants," "whereby accordc ing to the cuftorn of merchants," the defendant became liable, and fo being liable, &c.
In p. 122 is another by payee v. the maker of a promiffory note calling it a "bill or note," and fetting forth the cuftom fpecially.
In every'cafe upon a promiffory note the declaration is grounded en the cuftom of merchants.
Upon a review of this lift of authorities and precedents we are at a lofs to imagine from what motive and upon what grounds, lord Holt ceuld at once undertake to orer-rule all thefe cafes, and.totally change the l2w as to promiffory notes: and why he fhould admit inland bills of exchange to be -within the cuftom of merchants, and deny that privilegc to promif'ory notes; when the fame evidence

which proved the former to be within the cuftom equally proved that ,it extended to the latter. By examining the books it will be found that molt of the points which have been decided refpe&ing inland bills of exchange, have been decided upon cafts on promiffory notes. If he confidered promiffory notes as a new invention, when compared with inland bills of exchange, he feems to have miftaken' the fad ; f6r the probability is that the former are the moft ancient, or, to fay the leaft, are of equal antiquity.

VI. But let us proceed to examine the cafe of Clerk v.. Martin, (Pafch. i Anne, B. R.) 2 lord Ray. 7.57. I Salk. 129, upon which alone is founded the affertion in modern books "cthat before the ftatute of Anne promiffory notes were not aifignable or indorfeable over
within the cuftom of merchants, fo as to enable the indorfee to bring
an adion in his own name againft the maker." The cafe is thus re-
ported by lord Raymond:

"The plaintiff brought an a&ion upon his cafe againft the defend-

, ant upon feveral promifes ; one count was upon a general indebita-

"tus aflumk~t for money lent to the defendant; another was upon

the cujiom of merchants as upn a bill of exchange ; and fhewed that

"the defendant gave a notefbfcribed by himfif, by which he promifid to

"'pay.

to the plaintiffor his order, &c. Upon non afIumift

( a verdid was given for the plaintiff, and entire damages. And it was

c moved in arreft of judgment, that this note war not a bill of exchange

" 'within the cufmoof merchants, and therefore the plaintiff, having de-

"delared upon it as fuch, was wrong; but that the proper way in fuch

"cafes is to declare upon a general indebitatus afumpyt for money
6* lent, and the note 'would be good evidence of it.

"But it was argued by Sir Bartholomew. Shower, the laft
c Michaelmas term, for the plaintiff, that this note being payable to · the plaintiff or his order,, was a bill of exchange inafmuch as ly its "f natureit was negotiable i and that diftinguifhes it from a note pay"able to 1. S. or bearer, which he. admitted was not a bill of exchange cc becaufe it is not a/ignable nor indorfable by the intentof the fubfcriber, " and confequently not negotiable, and therefore it can not be a bill ccof ex ,hangeb; ecaufe it is incident to the nature of a bill of ex,c laInge to be negotiable ; but here this bill is negotiable, for i/it had ,.been indoifedpayable to . N. 1. N. might have brought his aRion upon -1 it as upon a bill'of exchange, and might have declared ufon the cuftom of
" merchants. Why then thould it not be, before fuch indorfenent, a
" bill of exchange to the plaintiff himfef, fince the defendant by his
" fubfcriptionhas fhown hi. intent to be liable to the payment of this

APPENDIX.
" money to the plaintiff or his order; and fince he bhith thereby agreed " that itjhall be aignableover, which is by confequence that it fhall be " a bill of exchange. rhat there is no difference in reafon between " a note which faith, " I promife to pay to I. S. or order," &c. and a ,c note which faith, It I pray you to pay to I. S.' or order," &c. they are " both equally negotiable, and to make fuch a note a bill of exchange
can be no wrong to the defendant, becaufe he, by the- figning of the " note, has made himfelf to that purpofe a merchant, (-2 Vent. 29"4. 1, Srifield v. Witherly) and has given his coifent that his note,/hall be neC gotiated, and thereby has fubjeaed himfelf to the law of merchant4.'"
c But Holt, chief juftice, was totis viribus againft the affion ; and "cfaid that this could not be a bill of exchange. That the maintaining "' of thefe aaions upon fuch notes, were innovations upen the rules of lhe " common law; and that it inmounted to a newfirt offpecialty unknown to the " common lawv and invented in Lombardflreet,w/jich attempted in thefreout"ters of billsof exchange to givelaws to 1TVeflminler Hall. That theconti'uing " to declare upon th fie notes upon thecjflom of merchantsproceededupon ob ina" cy and opinionativenf;, fince he had always expreffed his opinion againit . them, andJince.there wasfo _eafy a method as to declare upon a general " indebitatus ajjumpfitfor money lent, &c. As to the cafe of Sarsfield " v. Witherly, he faid he was not fatisfied with the judgment of the " king's bench, and that he advifed the bringing a Writ of error.
Gould, juftice, faid, that he did not remember it had ever been " adjudged that a note in which the fubfcriber promifed to pay, &c. to " L S. or bearer, was not a bill of exchange. That the bea-er could " not fue an ation upon fuch a note in his own name, is without doubt; " and fo it was refolved between Horton and Coggs, now printed in 3 ,Lev. 299, but that it was never refolved that the party himfef (to "whom fach note was payable) could not have an affion upon the " ct/lom of merchants uponfuch a bill. But Holt, chief juftice, anfwer" ed that it was held in the faid cafe of Horton v. Coggs, that fuch a " note was not a bill of exchange within the cuftom of merchants. " And afterwards in this Eafter term it was moved again, and the " court continued to be of opinion againit the a~tion. And then ,, Mr. Branthwaite for the plaintiff urged, that if this note was not " a bill of exchange within the cuftom of merchants, then the pro" mife -founded upon it was void; and then it could not be intended
" that any damage was given by the jury for the breach of it, but all
"the damages muft be intended to have been given upon the general ( indebitatus aqfumpfit_ I olt, chief juftice, faid that would be true,
"if it had been void by reafon of its being infenfible ; but this mat" ter is fenfible enough, though not i~ffient in law to rafe a prnm'ife
F .3

APPENDIX.
"and therefore one cannot in'tend but that damages were given for "it ; aid confequently that judgment muff be arrefted. And judg"ment was given, quod querens nil capiat per billam, &c. by the opi"nion of the whole court."
As four other cafes are reported upon this fubje& prior to the ftatute of Anne, all of which were dependant upon this of Clerk and ,lartin, it may be proper to notice what fell from the court in each, before any comments are made on that cafe.
At the fame term,, the cafe of Potter v. Pearfon, i lord Ray. 759, was upon a writ of error from C. B. In which the c6urt faid, " it is "ta void cuftom, fince it bindq a man to pay money without any confi",deration; for the rule is, ex nudo pa~lo non orituradlio. And there" fore the judgment was reverfed."
In the cafe of Burton v. Souter, at the next term, (2 Lord Ray. 774,) it was moved in arreft of judgment,. "that fuch a note is not within " the cuftom of merchants, but they ought to declare upon a mutuatus " and give the note in evidence, as it was fettled laft term between Clerk " and Martin. And of that opinion was the whole court."
The cafe of Williams v. .Cutting, at the next term, (2 Lord Ray. 825. lfarr. 154.) was another writ of error from the C. B, There were two counts: x, on the cuJlom of merchants, declaring upon a note given by the defendant to the plaintiff promifing to pay him fo much money. 2, Upon an indebitatus affumpfit. There were feveral -damnages, but only one judgment; and it was affigned for error that the count upon the cuftor of merchants was void ; and therefore there being one entire judgment, all was void, and judgment ought to be reverfed in toto. And the cafe of Clerk and Martin, was quoted as an authority in point.
The court were all of opinion that, "if one of the declarations wag 1fuch on which no damages ought to be recovered, it would be bad." Andper Holt, as to that point he had ,,propofed it to all the judges, and " that tliey were all of opinion that a declaration upon the cuftom of 4 merchants upon a note fubfcribed by the defendant to the plaintiff for "fo much money, or promifing fo much money was void ; for it tendcc ed to make a note amount to a fpecialty. And judgment thereupon was "1 reverfed in toto."
Lord Raymond does pot mention this laft obfervation of Lord Holt, but fays, "INote, all. the judges bld clearly that the fr#4 count was ill,

APPENDIX.
It' (according to the cafe of Clerk v. Martin,) except Powell, )jqlice,Iwo ·"doubted."
The next and laft cafe in the books before the flatute of Anne, is that of Buller v. Crips (Mich. 2 Anne, Ann? 1703.) 6 Mod. 29. "A " note was in this form, c Ipromife to pay to L S. or order, thefum of " 6. ioo, on account of wine had of him." " I. S. indorfes this note c to another ; the indorfee brings the aafion againft him that drew the " note, and declares upon the cuJom of merchants, as upon a bill ofexchange; c and a motion was in arreft of judgment, upon the authority of Marcc tin and Clerk's eafe.
" But Brotherick would diftinguifh this cafe from that; for there " theparty to whom the no* was originally made breught the adion,"but " here it is by indorfee ; and he that gave this note, did, by the tenor i thereof, make it affignable or negotiable by the words "pr order," " which amounts to a promife, or undertaking, to pay to any whom 1e - fhould appoint, and the indorfement is an appointment to the plainti."
c Chief juflice Holt. I remember when af'ions upon inland bills " of exchange did firft begin ; and there they laid a particular cuftom " between London and Briftol, and it was an adfion againft the ac" ceptor. The defendant's'counfel would have put them to-prove the " cuftom; at which Hale who tried it laughed and faid, They had a " hopeful cafe on't. And in my Lord North's time it was fail that the " cuftom in that cafe was part bf the common law of England, and " the afions fince became frequent as the trade of the nation did in" creafe ; and all the difference between foreign and inland bills is, " that foreign'bills muft be protefted before a public notary, before c the drawer.may be charged; but inland bills need no proteft. And the " notes in queqfion are only an invention of the goldftnitbs in LombardJlreet, " who had a mindto make a law to bindallthofe thatdid deal with them. Aind "fure to allowfich note to carryany lien with it, were to turn apieceof pa: per, which is in law but evidence of a parolcontraR7, into a fpecialty, and "befides to empower one to affign that to another, which he could "not have himfelf ; for fince he to whom this note was made could cc not have this aaion, how can his affignee have it ? And therl notes "are not in the natureof a bill ofe~change; for the reafon"of the cuf"tom of bills of exchange is, for the expedition of trade, and itsfafety;
and likewife it hinders the exportation of rmney out of the realm.
" He faid, if indorfee had brought this a&.ion againft indorfer, it c might peradventure lie, fir the indorfement 'may be faid t6 be tanta:"' moutt to drawinga new billforfe much money as the nite isfor, upon the

APPENDIX.
"perfon that gave the'note ; or he may fue theftrft drawer in the name " of the indorfcr, 'and convert the money, when recovered, to his , own ufe; for the indorfement amounts. at leaft to an agreement, " that the indorfce fhould fue.for the money in the name of the in" dorfer, and receive it to his own ufe. 'And befides, it. is a good au-9 thority to the original drawer to. pay the money to indorfee. And '" Powell juftice cited one cafe where a plaintiff had judgment upon "a declaration of this kind in the common plea5; and that my lord " Treby was very earneft for it, as a mighty conveniency for trade "but that when they had confidered well the reafons why it was , doubted here, they began to doubt too ; and the whole court feem" ed clear for ftaying the judgment, And at another day the chief "juftice declared, that he had defired to fpeak with two of the moft "famous merchants in London, to be informed of the miglty ill con"fequences that was pretended would enfue by obtrufting this courfe ; " and that they had told him, it was very frequent with them to make
".Ach notes, and that they looked upon them as bills of -whange, and that "they had been ufed for a matter Yf thirty years ; and that not only notes " but bonds for money, were transfered frequently, and endorfed as "bills of exchange. Indeed I agree a bill of exchange may be made "between two perfons 'withouta third; and if there be fuch a neceffi"ty of dealing that way, why do not dealers ufe that way which is
legal ? and mpy be this; as if A. has money to lodge in B,'s " hands, and .ould have a negotiable note for it, it's only faying S,thus ; 1 Mr. B. Jay me,,or order,Jo much money, value to yourfelf;"
" and figning th's, andi B. accepting it ; or he maytake the common "note and fay thus; for value to youtfel, pay indorfee fo much ;. and "good. *lnil the court at loft took the vacation to. com1/ider of it."i But what became of the cafe afterwards does not appear.
Thefe five cafes, viz. Clerk v. Martin, Potter v. Pearon, Burton v. Souter, Cutting'v. Williams, and Buller v, Crips, are the only reported cafes in which the former decifions were over-ruled, and it 'may be obferved that the four Taft were decided upon the autbority of the firft -which is to be confidered as the leading cafe ; and' it is in that cafe, therefore, that we are to look for the grounds upon which fo great a thange of the cftablifhed law was founded. We lhall however confider the reafors that are fcattered among the whole, as having concurred in the formatibn of lord Holt's opinion. In the firft place, we find an affertion of his lordihip, in Clerk v. Martin, " that'this " note could not be a bil) of exchinge," but lie feems to have been too much irritated at that time to give a reafon for the affertion, or to recolle& that in the cafe of Hill 'v. Lewisj, upon promifory notes, he had faid " that goldfinit.h's bill were governedby the fame laws andcuflom, as

APPENDIX.
i other bills ff exchange," and that the verdiiJ in that ca,' would be good .,ffound upon the bills of exchange."
His next affertion is, "that the maintaining thefe afios upon fuch Unotes, were innovations upon the rulesofthe common law."
But if, as we have ihown, the cuffom of merchants is a part of thecommon law; if promiffory notes had always, from the time of their firft introdufion, been adjudged to be as much within the cuflom of merchants, as inland bills of exchange, then an affion on a promiffory note, founded on the cuftom, was not more an innovation than a like alion upon an inland bill of exchange. Befides, that could hardly deferve the name of innovation, which had been fandioned by all thejudges of England, on a demurrer, as was th cafe in Williams and Williams.
His next affertion is, "cthat it amounted to the fetting up a new ",fortof fpecialty, unknown to the common law, and invented in Loin" bardfireet." To this it may be anfwered that it did not amount to the fetting up a fpecialty, becaufe the confideration of a fpecialty is not examinable at law; but between immediate parties to a bill of exchange or a promiffory note the defendant might always have availed himfelf of the want of confideration. I only amounted at mof to the' fetting up a promiffory note as~a bill of exchange. The affertion that promiffory notes were invented in Lombard ftreet, is certainly not corret, for Malynes mentions them as in ufe in foreign countries, and as being affignable by the cuftom of merchants, long before they appear to have been introduced into England.
The other affertions of his lordfhip only tend to fhew,a degree of irritation which derogates from the refped which the decifion might otherwife deferve, The mildnefs of Mr. Juftice Gould, forms a contraft with .the precipitation of the chief juftice. He faid, "che did "f not remember that it had ever been adjudged, that a note in which cc the fubfcriber promifed to pay, &c. to I. S. or bearer, was not a " bill of exchange ;" and that it was never refolved, that the party " himfelf, to whom fuch note was payable, could not have an a6ion "upon the cq/om of merchants,upon fuch a bill."
In the cafe of Potter v. Pearfin, it was faid that ccit is a void " cuftom, fince it binds a man to pay money without conjideration." This reafon equallyapplio" to inland-bills, and is no reafon why a ditlinction fhould be taken between them, and promiffory notes payable to order. The one is as much a mercantile. tranfaaion as the other ;

APPENDIX.
and " a nultum pa7uin doe§ not exift in the ufage and law of mer- chants," nor is " the want of confideration an objedion in corn- incrcial cafes." 3 Bur. 1669.' I Powellon Con. 341.
Tie cafe of Burton v. Souter, furnifhes no ne reafon, but relies entirely upon the cafe of Clerk v. Martin.
The cafe of Williams v. Cutting, as reported by lord Ray. 825, Aiews only that Mr. Juftice Powell doubted upon the cafe of Clerk and Martin. But in Farr.aSS, it appears that Holt faid, " he had cc propofed it to all the judges, and that they were a/l of opinion that " a declaration upon the cuftdm of merchants upon a note was void ; ,,.tip it tended to make a note amount to a fpecialty." It has been before fliewn that this reafon was not founded in faR; and it may be further remarked that if true in point of faa, yet it would equally apply to inland bill, and therefore is no ground for a difcriminatiork. But it appears by lord Raymond, that all the judges did not agree, for Powell doubted.
The cafe of B'h'erand Cripfs, differed from the others in this, that the a&ion was brought by the firft indorfee, and not by the payee of the note. Lord Holt again declares that "the notes in queftion are - only an invention of the goldfiniths in Lombard-fireet," in which he was certainly miftaken. He repeats that "to allow fuch a note to 4"carry any lien with it were to turn a piece of paper, which is in " law but evidence of a parol contraa, into afpecialty ;" and the reafon which he gives why this cafe ought not to be diftinguiflied from that of C!krk v. Martin, is that a man can not affign that.which he has not himfelf. But it is not is aI gnee that the indorfee was intitled to his adion, but as the payee of a bill of exchange; for an indorfed notc is a bill drawn, by the payee of the note, upon the maker, in favour of the indorfee ; and the maker accepts the bill when he figns the notc, for itis no objeaion to the acceptance of a bill that the accept·nce is made bqfore the bill. However, if the judgment in Clerk and Martin, was againift law, the foundation of lord Holt's opinion in this cafe muf fail. His lordfhip again afferts that, " thefe notes are not " in the nature of a bill of exchange ;" and he now condefcends to give his reafons why.they are not; " for the reafon of the cuftom of .." bills of exchange is for tihe expedition of trade, and its fafety and " likewife it hinders exportation of money out of the reahn;" in each of which reafons he is equally unfortunate, for the expedition of trade imnLot more promoted, nor is its fafety more fecured~by inland bills Oian by promiiffory notes, nor is the exportation of money more prevnted by the for'Mer than bt the latter. Indeed it is in modern times

APPENDIX.
fuAly admitted, that payment by bills on a foreign country ha no effea either by increafing or diminifhing the current coin of a nation. For payment of a fum by exchange prevents the importation qf exadly the fame fum of money.
But lord Holt himfelf admitted that " if the indorfee had brought (I thir adion againft the indorfer, it might ptradventure lic ; for the t4 indorfimentmay be faid to be tantamount to the drawinga newo billforfo " much as the note isfor, upon theperfon that gave the note; or he may fue '" the firft drawer in the name of the indorfer, and convert the money, " when recovered, to his own ufe ; for the indorfement amounts at " lea9 to an agreement that the indorfee fhould fue for the money in " the name of the indorfer, and receive it to his own ufe ; and be" fides it is a good authority to the original drawer to pay the money " to the indorfee."'
If this indorfement makes it a bill of exchange for one purpofe, the reafon is not eafily perceived why it fhould not be a bill of exchange for other purpofes. The exprefs promife of the maker to' pay the mo-, ney to the indorfee feems to be at leaft equal to an acceptance of the bill; and, as it has been before obferved, a bill may be accepted before it is in fadf drawn ; 3 Bur. 1663, Doug. 284, 1 Atk. 715, (611,) Kyd 4 8. A bill drawn by a man on himf/'f " is payabli-by him at all c events," and fuch a bill " is tantamount to an acceptance." i Wene. f/flem p leading, 225.
Lord Holt adriits alfo that the in.dorfemgent will authorize the indorfee to i'ue in the name of the indorfcr ; hence it appears that the whole difpute was merely about the form of the affion ; andthis renders it, the more aftonilAing that he fhould have contended 9 totis viribus," as lord Raymond fays he did, for an exception fo clearly contrary to the juftice of the cafe, efpecially as the point had been before fo fo'. lemnly fettled in the cafe of Williams and WVilliams. Indeed his lordfhip feems, by the latter part of the report of Buller v. Crips, to have relented a little, after his converfation with the merchants, for he agreed " that a bill of exchange may be made between two perfons C without a third" by faying thus, (Mr. B. pay me, or order, fo much " money, value to yourfelf ; and figning this and B.accepting it. Or " he may take the common note aYld fay thus, For value to yourfelf, pay, "iudorfee fo much ; and good."
This 14t example feems to have been precifely thecae before the court ; and as the court adjourned witho.ut giving judgment, it feems

APPENDIX.
to be doubtful how they would have decided, notwithfianding what had been faid before'.
Hence then we find, from an examination of all the cafes before
.te ftatute of Anne, that it never was adjudgedthat a promiffory note for
noney payable to order, and indorfed, .was not an inland bill of exchange. But we find that the contrary principle had beenxecognized in all the cafes from the time of the firft introdu&ion of inland bills and pfomiffory notes to the firft year of Queen Anne, and that in one of them it had been exprefsly adjudged upon demurrer in the king's bench, and the judgment afirmed upon argument in the exchequer chamber, before all the judges of the common pleas and barons of the exchequer, fo that it may truly be faid to have been folemnly adjudged by all the judges of England. Principles of law fo eftablifhed are not to be thaken by the breath of a fingle judge, however great may be his learning, his talIents or his virtues. That lord Holt poffeffed thefe in an eminent degree will neyer be denied ; but he was not exempt from human infirmity. The report itfelf, in the cafe of Clerk v. MA'fartin, fhows that, from fome caufe or other, he was extremely irritated with the goldfmiths of Lombard ftreet, and that his mind was not in a proper ifate for calm deliberation and found judgment. The fame obfervation applies to the cafe of Buller v. Crips, and is further confirmed by that of Ward and Evals, 2 lord Ray. 930, in which his lordfhip faid " But then I am of opinion and always was (notw7it4/landing the - nolfe andcry, that it is the tfe of Lomnardflreet, as if the contrary opi" nion 'wouldblow up Lombardlreet) that the acceptance of fuch a note " is not a&ual payment." This circumftance has alfo been noticed by. judges and others, in fome of the more modern reports. In the cafe of Grant v. Vaughan, 3 Bur. 52o, Sir Fletcher Norton and Mr. Dunning obferve that " lord Holt was peevi/h" in the cafe of Clerk and JlMartih, and lord Mfansfield remarked that " lord Holt got 'i into a dispute with the city about it." In i TV. BL 487, lord Mfansfield faid, "The firft ftruggle of the merchants, (which made Ioltfo angry " with them,) to make inland bills in the nature offpecialties, and to - declare upon them as fuch, was certainly wrong on their parts ; as 4 it 'was admitted they might declare on general indebitatus ajumpflt, " and give thefe bills in evidence. But the reafons given by the " judges, why no a&ion can be brought by the holder of fuch a bill,
c payable to bearer, are equally ill-founded." And in the cafe of ' Brovn and Harraden, 4 Term Rep. i5 t, lordKenyon faid, it is not " neceffary now to confider whether or not lord Holt were right in fo c-pertinacioufly adhering to his opinion, before the ftatute of Anne, " that no naion could be maintained on promiffory notes, as inifrucc ments, but that they were only to be confidered as evidence of the

APPENDIX.
(U debt : that qtieftion exercifed the judgments of the .bleft men at c' that time ; but the authority which his opinion had in WP/iminr er Hall, " madeothersyieldto him ; and it was thought necefary torefort to the " legiflature to apply a remedy." And in the fame cafe, p. 154, Buller, juftice, faid "The cafes cited by the defendant's counfel are i extremely material ; for though they do not direfly decide the quef" tion, they fhew that the courts of Weftminfter have thought the ".analogy between bills of exchange and promiffory notes foflrong " that the rules e/flablijTed with refpeR7 to one ought a/Jo to prevail as to the " other. Such is the general tendency of the cafes fince lord Manf", field's time. Many of the cafes alluded to by the plaixitiff's coun" fel, happened before the flatute of Anne : they only thew theJtrong "cdifpoition 'whichlord Holt manift/edon all occafions to dlfcouagepromif"fory notes. It appears from them that lord Holt and the merchants ' wereperpetually difputing whether or not they flhould he put upon the ,c fame footing with bills of exchange. The merchants did not con"c tend that they might recover on notes in particular cafes only, but " that theyJhouldbe univerfally confidered in the fame light as bills of ,x4t change. 'Upon that ground they applied to the legiflature for relieft, "cand theirconduR is veryjtrong to/hew what cotfflru5iion the flatute of "6Anne ought to receive."
Lord Kenyon faid " it has been argued that there is an efentialdif" ference between bills of exchange and promiffory notes ; and that c there are reafons why the acceptor of the one lhould be allowed " more time than the maker of the other; but lcojfefs Jfee no diyer.nce
wwhatever ; they both make engagements of the (aniu nature, and when the
" acceptor has accepted a bill he is equally bound to be prepared to " pay on the day appointed, as the maker of a promiffory note." Lord Hardwicke in the cafe of Wahiley v. Child, anno 1749, 1 Vez. 346, fays, " The reafon of making the flatute 3 and 4 Anne arofe : fromfome determinations, in the beginning of her reign, by Holtchief "ju4ice, that no aftion could be maintain-d on a promffory note, nor " declaration thereupon, viz. Clerk v. Aartin, and Potterv. Pearfon, 4i Salk. 129 which cafes producedtht ac ; as the a& itfelf recites ; " but that at of parliament did not alter, but :hat fill an ind,uitatus "af9unpftt may be bruught, and the note given in evidence, or proved " if loft." From this concurrent teftimony it is apparent, that the cafe of Clerk v. Martin was a hafty intemperate decifion of lord Holt, which was acquiefced in by the other judges, in confequence of his overbearing authority, " wlich made others yidd to hirn" and that he fo "pertinacioijly" adhered to hi; opinion, as to render rt neceffary to apply to parliament to over-rule kin.

,APPENDIX.
.This, 'it is believed, is the true origin of the flatute of Anne# which did not enaL a new law, but fimhply confirmed the old ; the authority of which had been fhaken by the late decifion of lord Holt, This idea is confirmed by the words of the preamble of the flatute, which are, cc Whereas it hath been held" that notes in writing, &c. payable to order, " were not affignable or indorfable over, within the " ciglom of merchants," and that the payee could ",not maintain an ac-,
tion, by the cujfom of merchants," againft the maker; and that the indorfee ",could not, within thefaidcuflom of merchants, maintain an ac"6 tion upon fuch note" againft the maker; "therefore, to the intent to " encourage trade and commerce," &c. Be it ena6ted, &c. that all notes in writing made and figned by any perfon, &c. whereby fuch perfon, &c. fhall promife to pay to any other perfon, &c. or his order, or unto bearer, any fum of money, &c. "/bfallbe taken andcon"frued to be, by virtue thereof, due and payable to any fuch perfon, &c.
qthoom thefame is made payable ;" " and alfo every fuch note pay" able to any perfon," &c. " or his order, fhall be affignable or in" dorfable over, in the fame manner as inland bills of exchange are or
may be, according to the cu/tmn of merchants," and that the payee "may maintain an aaion for the fame, infuch manner as he might do
"upon any inland bill of exchange, made or drawn accordingto the cif/lon "ofmerchants, againft the perfon,, &c. who figned the fame." And that the indlorfee"9 may maintain his affion," for fuch fumn of money either againf the maker or any of the indorfers, " in like manner as in
"9cfes.of inland bilb of exchange." Here it may be obferved, that by
ufing the words, " it hath been held," the legiflature clearly allude to certain opinions, which they carefully avoid to recognize as law. And in,the enaaing claufe they fay that fuch notes "Jhallbe taken'and con"flrued to be due and payable," &c. expreffing thereby a command to certain peyfons, without faying exprefsly that the notes fhali be due and payabie, &c. for this being the law before it was rot nceffary to enatl the thing itfelf, but to inftru6 the judges how they Abould con.flaue it. The mifchief to be remedied was the opinion which had " been hd," not any defea in the law itfelf. By comparing this a&t with the cafes decided prior to Clerk and Martin, it will be found to contain no printiples but fuch as had been fully recognized by the courts of law. It follows, therefore, that it was paffed fimply to reflore the old order of thing., which had been difturbed by lord Holt,
The only real ffet of the ftatute was to alter a few words in the declaration. The old forms allege that the defendant became liable by reafon of the ciJiom of merciAants, the new f'.y that he became liabie ,by force of theJiatute. Even lord Holt himfelf always admitted that an indebitatus aqnnpfat for monei had and received, or money lent,,

would lie, and the note would be good evidence of it. HiN objections were only to the form of the a-tion, and not to the liability of the parties.
A promiffory note was always as much a mercantile iiffrument as an inland bill of exchange, and there certainly feems to be more evidence that the former is within the cufIom of merchants than the latter, and that it was fo at an earlier period on the continent of Europe, from whence it was introduced into England ; and when introduced it came attended with all the obligations annexed which the cu6, .tom had attached to it.
We fometimes, in modern books, meet with an afrertion that a promiffory note was not negotiable at coiiinon law ; this may be true, becarfe a promiffory note was not known at common law, if from the term common law we exclude the idea of the cuflom of merchants. It was a mercantile infirument introduced under the 6uftom of mer-chants. But if the cuftom of merchants is confidered, as it really is, a part of the common law, then the affertion that a promiflory note was not negotiable at the common law, is not corred.
VIII. In the prefent cafe of Dunlop v. Silver, it is not neceffary to enquire whether a promiffory note, while it is confined to the original parties, can be cohfidered as a bill of exchange within the cuftorm of merchants, although the authorities already cited fhow it to have been fo adjudged; but it is fufficient if it become fo by being indorfed. It has already been obferved that it has never been decided tLat an indorfed promiffbry note is not a bill of exchange, or a.negotiable initrument, under the cuftom of merchants, but that the contrary has been folemnly adjuadged ; and 'has been fettled law for more than a century.
One of the counts in the pi.cfent cafe is for .money had and received, and the evidence produced is a promiffory note made by Cavan, payable to the defendants or order, by them indorfed to Downing and Dowell, and by them to the plaintiff. The note was in due timeproteed, as an inland bill of exchange, for non-payment, and due notice given to the defendants. So that every flep was taken which would have been neceffary to charge the defendants as drawers, or itdorfers of an inland bill.
The indorfement of the defendants is evidence of money received by them from the intermedi.te indorfers, and the only q(ud'ilon is, ,whetherthe money, fo received, is for the ufe of the plaintiF. The

APPENDIX.
folution of this queftion depends upon the natureof the contradi which the defendants entered into by their indorfement. Lord Holt himfelf always admitted that every indorfement was the drawing of a new bill; and even in the cafe of Buller v. Crips, he admits that the indorfement of a promiffory note is the drawing of a bill on the maker in favour of the indorfee, and that the indorfee may maintain an action againft the indorfer upon the cuflom of merchants. Thig principle, which fo far. from being denied, has always been recognized in the fubfequent cafes, Chitty 121, 4 T. R. 149, decides the nature of the engagement which the defendants entered into by their indorfement. It was that of the drawer of an inland bill of exchange, whofe obligation as fuch is well afcertained by the euftom of merchants. The plaintiff does not claim as agtgnee at common law, but as indorfee under the law merchant; by which law the defendants are clearly liable as drawers of the bill to pay the money to any indorfee, holder of the bill; and where the plaintiff has either an equitable or legal right to money received by the defendant, be may recover in an action for money had and received. The defendants, then, having rec'eived money (which they are clearly not entitied to hold, for it is admitted that the intermeate indorfer would be entitled to recover it againft them) and being, by the terms of their contra6, as conftrued by the cuftom of merchants, liable to the plaintiff, are anfwerable in an afion for money had and received. We have feen that in the old declarations upon bills of exchange, the cuftom of merchants is not alleged, and yet the courts prefumed that the advancer of the money was the favor of the plaintiff, through whom the plaintiff is fuppofed to pay the money to the defendant. In the cafe of Woodward and Row, before cited, the court faid exprefsly that they would " in"4tend that he, of whom the' value is faid to be received by the de" fendant, was thiplaintf's fervant:' Upon the fame principle the intermediate indorfer is to be prefumed to be the fervant of the plaintiff in the"prefent cafe.
The indorfer of apromiffory note, or bill of exchange, when he receives the money from the indorfee, holds it in truft to be re-paid to the holder -of the bill or note, if he fhall fail to obtain it from the acceptor .or maker, after ufing due diligence, and giving proper notice. When this contingency has happened, the truft becomes abfolute, andit is againft confcience if the indorfer refufes to pay the money to whom of right it belongs.
The argument on the part of the defendants in this a&ion is, that as a promiflory note is not an iriltrument negotiable by the cuftom of merchants ; as the ftatute of Anne is not in force in Virginia, and as

APPENDIX.
the adl of affembly of Virginia does not give an adion againft the indorfer, his engagement is only fuch as arifes at common law; which is only an imJplied contract to refund morley which has been paid in conteimplation -of a confideration that has failed. That this contrad exifts only between the indorfer and his immediate indorfee, and is fuch a chofe in ation as by the common law is not affignable. That it arifes only in confequence of the money paid, and is raifed in favour of that perfon only from whom the money was received. That the payment of the money by the plaintiff to the intermediate indorfer raifes no contradt between the defendant and the plaintiff. That there is no privity between the plaintiff and defendant, whereby the plaintiff can derive any benefit from the contraft made by the defendant with the intermediate indorfer; and that no adion of indebitatus affumpfrt will lie without fuch privity. That even fuppofing the contra& of the defendant was exprefs to pay the money to the intermediate indorfer, or to his order, yet that contraCt would not be negotiable or affignab-le fo as to enable the plaintiff to recover in his own name, becaufe no confideration moved from him, and no promife is made to him; and if the promife were in fai made to him, yet it ,would be as to him nudum paaum.
This argument, fo far as it is neceffary to confider it, may be re. *uced to thefe five propofitions:
i. That promiffory notes are not negotiable within the cuftom of inerchants.
2. That the contra& of the indorfer is only an implied contraCt, grounded on the receipt of money upon a confideration that hag failed.
3. That this contraa is a chofe in a7ion, not affighable.
4. That no affion of indebitatus affumpfit will lie without privity.
5. That a promife in writing, without a confideration expreffed, is a nudum padum.
The firp.rofpolfiltion, viz. that promiffory notes are not negotiable
within the cuftom of merchants, has been fully confidered, and feems not to be maintainable. It might therefore be deemed unnecefary to examine the argument further; but as fome of the other points arc queftionable, it may be worth while to notice them.

APPENDIX,
The 2d propofition is that the contrad of the indorfer is only an implied contrat, grounded upon the receipt of money upon a confideration which has failed.
If this were true, it would equally apply to'the cafe where a man. teceives a note with a blank indorfement and paffes it away, for a valuable confideration, without indorfing it himfelf. But in fuch a cafe, no man has ever been held liable, unlefs there was an antecedent debt, or from partlcular circumftances a guaranty of the note could be prefumed, or unlefs he knew the note to be a bad one at the time. 3 T. R. 7S9, 76t, Fenn v. Harrifon. This point was early decided in the' cafe of the Bank of England-0. Newman in x lord Ray. 442. It is true that this was a note payable to the defendant or bearer, but it has been held in the cafe of Peacock v. Rhodes, Doug. 636, (614,) and Doug. 639, (617,) Ancher v. Bank of England, that a note with a blank indorfement is exafly like a note payable to beaver. The reafon is that the receiver of fuch a note takes it upon the credit of the parties named upon it, and gives no perfonal credit to the man who merely pays it away, without indorfement. 'The obligation of the indorfer then does not arife from the receipt of money only, but in confequence of his having written his name upon the infirument. But the fimple writing of his name upon the inftrument can create no obligation unlefs it be the fign of a certain contra&. Words are but reprefentatives of ideas, and evidence of the intention of the contrafing parties. Any other mode of conveying thofe ideas and teftifying that intention, if equalif certain, is equally capable of being the evidence of an exprefs contraeL. The a& of writing ones name upon the back of an inftrument of a certain defcription, is as firong evidence of an exprefs contra6t, as if it had been written in a thoufand words. What the nature of that contrat is, depends upon the nature of the infirument indorfed; but fill it iA not an im,. plied, but an exprefs contraa. The terms of that contra& are known by a reference to the ufual mode of tranfad"ing bufinefs, the nature of the inftrument, and the incidents which have been attached to it either by pofitive law, by common acceptation, or by judicial authority. The purpofe for which a man puts his name on the back of a promiffory note is well known, and can not be miftaken ; it is to give credit to the note ; but to anfwer that purpofe it muft be the fign of a contra6t to pay the money to the holdet if the maker does not. Such is the common acceptation and underftanding of the country. The fignature of the defendants is as much evidence of fuch a cofitra&, as it is of the receipt of the money, or of an orde: to pa' the money to the indorfec. But it is faid,

APPENDIX.
3dly. 'Tat fuch a contra&, being made with the immediate indorfee, is not negotiable, becaufe it is a chofe in adion which by common law can not be affigned.
To this it may be anfwered, that the antiquated do&rine that a chofe in aeion is not affignable was introduced in early times before negotiable infirumeolts were in ufe, when trade'was carried on in its fimpleft form, and when the principal, if not the only purpofe intended to bc anfwcred by the rule, was toprevent maintainance in controverfies refpeding titles to land. It was to prevent the poor man from being oppreffed by a powerful antagonift to whom his competitor might affign his title, and who by his wealth, his influence, or his power might pervert
j uftice. At what time, or by what means, it was firft applied to per-
fonal rights is not afcertained ; but it feems clear that in its original adoption it was never intended to apply to thofe inflruments which by thei, nature and the originalcontral7of the partieswere made negotiable. Every man has a natural right to make fuch contrads as he pleafes, provided they are not repugnant to any pofitive law, nor injurious to others; and all contra(ts entered into without fraud or force, are legally and morally obligatory according to their fpirit and intent. The reafon of the rule was to prevent maintainance. (Co. Lit. 214.) But no man could be oppreffed by maintainance who had exprefsly agreed to pay his debt to fuch perfon as his creditor fhould appoint. The reafon of the rule failing, the rule itfelf cannot apply. Blackitone, (2 Coin. 442,) calls it theflri&- rule of the ancient common law; and the reafori given is ccbecaufe it was thought to be a great encourage"ment to litigiouffiefs, if a mani were allowed to make ever to a " ftranger his right of going to law." But it was a rule introduced for the benefit of the debtor, and every man may wave the benefit of a law introduced for his advantage. Blackftone fays, " this nicety is cc now difregarded ; though, in compliance with the ancient principle, " the form of affigning a choe in aLTion is in the nature of a declaration " of truft," &c.
7'Voodefon fays (in vol. 2. p. 387.) " It is a maxim of the common 61law that no chofe in aition can be granted or affigned. The policy " whereof was to avoid a multiplicity of fuits, by preventing thofe " who would not profecute their right themfelves, fromn transferring " it to others of a more litigious difpofition ; and particularly to pre" vent the granting of pretended titles to great men, whereby, faith "4 fir Edward Coke, (i Infl. 214, (a.) '66, (a.) "Julice might be 44 trodden down," "4 Perhaps the ride was more general than the mif-
chief apprehended; and having relation originally to landed ales was " afterwards vntece/ierilv transferred to 6cijfnrl property. The doe,

" trine, however, always was, that a chofe in a&ion was affignabfe - in equity for a valuable confideration. Bills of exchange and pro" miffory notes are regularly affignable by indorfement; and if bonds; :," policies of infurance, and even judgments, are in like manner af"'figned for valuable confideration, the affignee may fue in the name " of the original claimant, and the, latter will not now be permitted, c even in the courts of common law, to undo his own transfer, or un- confcientioufly to obftru& the plaintiff's fuit. Where one of the " captors of a maritime prize, before condemnationthereof, transferred " hisproportonatefiareof the property taken, it was held that the af'fignee might maintain an aaion for the fame, againft the capturing c flip's agent, as for money received by him to the plaintiff's ufe.'" i Wifon 21 1. Morrough v. Comyns.
Upon which cafe it may be obferved, that the failor's right to fhare of the prize money was as clearly a chofe in a7ion as a right to any other property not in poffeffion ; and the affignment of fuch right was as clearly within the old rule that a chofe in agion is not affignable ; it is therefore a much ftronger cafe than that of a debt which, by the originalcontraRitfelf, the parties have made negotiable.
The cafes on this fubje& are colleded in a very able argument of judge Buller, in the cafe of Majfler v. .Miller, 4 T. rep. 340, and although the judgment in that' cafe was contrary to his opinion, yet it was not given upon the point mentioned in that part of his argument which we flhall cite. Evans on bills, io6, fpeaking of this argument, fays, " it furniflies a greater fhare of profeffional inftrudfion and a c more admirable fpecimen of judicial reafoning than can often be " found in an equal compafs." "It is laid down," fays the judge, " in our old books, that for avoiding maintenance a chofe in aaion can " not be aifgned or granted over to another. Co. Lit. 214. a. 266. a. " 2 Roll. 45. 1. 40- The good fenfe of that rule feems to me to be very ." quf/lionable; and in early as well as modern times, it has been fo explain4' ed away, that it "remains, at. moi, only an objedion to the form of the " anion in any cafe. In 2 Roll. ab. 45, 46, it is admitted that an obc ligation or other deed may be granted, fo that the writing paffes ; " but it is faid that the grantee cannot fue for it in his own name. If "a third perfon be permitted to acquire the intereft in a thing, whe" ther he is to bring the adion in his own name, or in that of the " grantor, does not feem to me to affe& the queftion of maintenance. " It is curious, and not altogether ufelefs, to fee how the dofine of " maintenance has from time to time been received in 'Weflmi'fer " Hall. At one time not only he iho laid out money to affift another " in his caufe, but he that by his triendfhip or intereft faved him an

" expence which he would otherwife be put to, was held guilty of ,c maintenance, Bro. tit. maintenance, 7, 14, 17, &c. Nay if he offiIt cioufly gave evidence, it was maintenance ; fo that he muft haVe " had afupana, or fupprefs the truth. That fuch do6trine, repugnant "4.to every honeft feeling of the human heart, fhould be foon laid 4c afide, muft be expeded. Accordingly a variety of exceptions were 4 foon made; and amongft others it was held, that if a perfon has "'any intereft in the thing in difputc, though on contingency only, " he may lawfully maintain an adion on it. 2 Roll. ab. i15. But " in the midi of all thefe dotrines on maintenance, there was one " cafe in which the courts of law allowed of an affignment of a chfi 94 in action ; and that was in the cafe of the crown; for the courts did. " not feel themfelves bold enough to tie up the property of the crown, " orto prevent that from being transferred. 3 Leon. r98. 2 Cro. i8o.
Courts of equityfi-om 'the earlieJt times thought the dotrine too abJilrd "for them to adopt ; and therefore they always a&ed in dired con16tradidfion to it. And we fihall foon fee that courts of law alfol, " altered their languagc very much. In 12 Mod. 554, the, court
fpeak of an affignment of an apprentice, or an aifignment of a bond, as things which are good between the parties ; and to which they "muff give their tandion, and adl upon. So an affignment of a chojf in afion has always been held a good confideration for a promife. "It was fo in t Roll. ab. 29. Sid. 212, and T. ones, 222; and
Slaiftly by all the judges of England in Moulfdale agaiijfl Birchall, 2
"Black. 820, though the debt affigned was uncertain. After 'thefe
" cafes 'we may venture tofay that the maxim was a badone, and that it pro" ceeded upon a foundation 'whichfails. But ftill it muft be admitted that "though the courts of law have gone the length of taking notice of " affignments of chofe in aeTion, and of ading upon them, yet in ma"ny cafes they have adhered to the formal objedfion, that the adipn '(i all be brought in the name of the aflignor, and not in the name " of the affignee. Ifee no ffe or conveniencd in preferving theIhadow,
" when thefubflance isgone; and that it is merely a fhadow, is apparent " from the latter cafep, in which the courts have, taken care that it "/hfall never work injuflice. In Bottomly v. Brooke, C. B. Mich. 22, G. 3. " (i T. R. 621,) which was debt on board, the defendant pleaded
"that the bond was given for fecuring f. ioo, lent to the defendant
" by E. Chancellor; and was given by hiCer diretion in truft for her, " and E. Chancellorwas indebted to the defendant in morq money. " To this plea there was a demurrer, which was withdrawn by the " advice of tie court. In Rudge v. Birch,, K. B. Mich. 2S. G. 3, c( i T. R. 622,) on the fame pleadings there was judgment for the "defendant. And in W*'nch v. Keely, K. B. Hill. 27. G. 3. (1 "T.R. 4 619,) where the obligee affigned over a bond, and afterwards be-

" came bankrupt, the court held that he might, notwithftanding, main' tain the a-tion. Mr. J. Afhhurft faid, " It is true that formerly " courts of law did not take notice of an equity or a truft * but of " late years, as it has been found produ&ive of great expence to fend 6 the parties to the other fide of the hall, wherever this court have t4 feen that the juftice of the cafe has been clearly with the plaintiff, " they have not turned him round upon this obje&ion. Then if this
"court will take notice of a truft, why fhould they not of an equity. "-It is certainly true that a chafe in atlion can not ftritly be affigned, " but this court will take notice of a truft, and fee who is beneficially "interefted." But admitting that on account of this quaint maxim, c there mayfill be fame cafes in which an adion can not be maintain" ed by an affignee of a chafe in atRion in his own name ; it remains to " be confidered whether that obje&ion ever did hold, or ever can hold, " in the cafe of a mercantile injqrument or tranfailion. The law merchant
" is a fyftem of -equity, founded on the rules of equity, and governed " in all its parts by plain juftice and good faith. In Pillan v. Van " AMicrop, lord Mansfield faid, if a man agree to do what if finally ex- ecuted would make him liable, as in a court of equity, fo in merc cantile tranfalins~., the law looks on the aR as done. Ican find no in,,iance ih qvhich the oljeaion has prevailed in a mnercantile cafe ; and in " the two inflances molt univerfally in ufe, it undoubtedly does not " hold, that is, in the cafes of bills of exchange, andpolicies ofinfurance." (He might have added the cafe of bills of lading.) "The firft is the ,, prefent cafe ; and bills are affignable by the cuftom of merchants.
,' So in the cafe of policies of infurance, till the late a& was made, re.c quiring that the name of the perfon interefted fhould be inferted in c' the policy, th conftant courfe was to make the policy in the name "cof the broker, and yet the owner of the goods maintained an affion ,' upon it. Circulation and the transfer of property are the life and "c foul of trade, and muft not be checked in any inftance. There is no

4. firft obligee. This contra&,is therefore devifed to operate upon " fubfequent affignments, and amounts to a declarationthat, upon]itch " affignment, the money which Ihave borrowuedjhallno longer bethe money " of A. but of B. hisfIuifitute. The plaintiff is certainly entitled to " the money in confcience ; and therefore I think entitled alfo at law ; 'Jor the defendant haspromifed to pay any petfon who is entitled to the mo-
ney." So, in the prefent cafe, I fay the plaintiffs are in confcience " entitled to the money, and the defendant has promifed to pay, or "which is the fame thing,, is bound by law to pay the money to any " perfon who is entitled. The very nature andfoundation of an aLion "for money had and received is that the pilaintiy is in confcience entitled to " the money; and on that ground it has been repeatedly faid to be a "bill in equity. We all remember the found and manly opinion given "by my Lord Chief Juftice here, in the beginning 6f the laft term, "on a motion made by Mr. Bearcroft for a new trial, wherein he faid,
"if hefoundjulice and hon/y on thefide of the plaint#i here, he would never turn him round, in order to give him the chance of gettingjuflicc
elfewhere. 2dly. Clarke v. Adair, fittings after Eafler, 4. G. 3. Debray, an officer, drew a bill on the agent of a regiment, payable
"out of the firft money which fhould become due to him on account " of arrears, or non-effetive money. Adair did not accept the bill, " but marked it in his book; and promifed to pay when effe&s camc
to hand. Debray died before the bill was paid ; and the admini"ftratrix brought an aftion againft Adair for money had and received. " It was allowed by all parties that this was not a bill within the cuf" tom of merchants: But lord Mansfield faid it is an a ignmentfor va" luable confderation; with notice to the agent, and he is bound to pay it.
" He faid he remembered a cafe in chancery where an agent under " the like circumftances had paid the money to the adminiftrator, and " was decreed, notwithftanding, to pay to the perfon in whofe fa"four the bill was drawn. 3dly. In Ifracl v. Douglas, C. B. Eal.
29. G" 3. (1 H. B. 242.) A. being indebted to B. and B. indebted to "C. B. gave an order to A. to pay C. the money due by A. to B. where" upon C. lent B. a further fitm, and the order was accepted by A. On
the refufal of A. to comply with the order, it was held that C. might " maintain an aftion for money had and received againfit him. And " Mr. J. Heath exprefsly faid he thought in mercantile tranfaccions Y' ·" this fort fuch an undertaking may be conftrued to make a man lia" ble for money had and received. This opinion was cited with ap-
probation in the houfe of lords in Gibjon v. Afinet. Laftly, T come to " the cafe of Tatlock v. Harris, (3 T .R. x82.) in which Lord Kcc nyon, in delivering the judgment of the court faid, " it war (in af-, "propriation offo much money to be paid to the peifon who jhoulM become the it holder of the bill. We conder it a; an agreement bet-ween all the par-

APPENDIX.
"( ties to appropriate o much property to be carried to the account of the " holder of the bill, and this will fatisfy the juftice of the cafe without
infringing any rule of law." All thefe cafes prove that the remedy fhall be enlarged, if neceffary, to attain the juftice of the cafe ; "and that if theplaint# hasjuflice and conf-ience on hisfde, and the de"fendant has notice only, the plaintfifKhall recover in an ailonfor money. "1had and received. Let us not -be lefs liberal than. our predeceffors, " and we ourfelvt s have been on former occafions. Let us recolle&t, as 4 lord chiefjuflice Wilmot faid in the cafe I have alluded to, that not "only bonijudicisej amp!iarejurfdiRionem,but ampliarejufliciam:and " that the common law of the land is the birth right of the fubje&. "under which we are bound to adminifter him juftice, without fend,ing him to his writ of fubpcena, if he can make that juftice appear. "The juftice, equity and go6d confciehee of the cafe of thefe plain' tiffs can admit of no queftion: neither can it be doubted but that the defendant has got the money which the plaintiffs ought to re' ceive."
Thus we fee that the rule, that a chofe in a,7ion is not affignable, has been often fhaken ; that at moft it amounts only to an objetionto the
form of a[Iion, and that courts of law ought to lean againft an exception
to form, which does not fupport the fubifantial merits of the cafe. No cafe is recolleCted in which it has ever prevailed when the inftrument was made negotiable by the original contraa and intention of the parties. This promiffory note was intended by theparties to be negotiable; it is made payable to order, and fays on the, face of it,
-' negotiable at the bank of AIexandria." And in the cafes of More v.
.Mainig, Comyns 31, A.che/on v. Fountain, i Str. 5S7, and Edie v. E. India Company, 2 Bur. 12 r6, it is determined that a bill or note, negotiable in its original creation, remains negotiable in. the 4ands of the indorfee, even if it be not indorfed payable to order. If the original contra& of the maker wap negotiable, the dependant contr,& of the indorfer muft be negotiable alfo, for he warrants that the. maker thall perform his engagement; which is, to pay the money to the holder. The indorfement follows the nature of the original contra l, and partakes of its negotiability.
That a chofe in ac7ion may be made negotiable or algnable in its original
creation, by the contraft and intention of the parties, independant q1 the
eujgom of merchants, and offlatute law, feems not to be a new idea, but is ftrongly fupported by the reafons affigned by the judges for their judgment in feveral of the reported cafes.

In thefe cafes it will be found that no confideration paffed from C. to B. nor any promife from B. to C. and yet an adion was held to be maintainable by C. againft B. upon the contra& made between A. and B. So that to fupport an aaion for Money had and received it is not neceffary that a confideration fhould pafs from the plaintiff to the defendant, nor any promife from the defendant to the plaintiff; and this principle will be found to run through all the cafes for money had and received.
In the cafe of Ole v. Dittle.feld, 23. Car. 2. B. R. x Vent. 154, the principle is carried fRilfalrther. The money in this cafe was not paid by A. to B. purpofely to pay over to C. as in the forpier cafes, but B. being indebted to A. and A. to C.-A. appointed C. to receive the money from B. in fatisfaaion of the debt, due to C. by A. which he, (A.) fignifying to B. (the defendant,) he, in confideration of the premifes, and that the plaintiff (C.) would forbear him a quarter of year, promifed that he would then pay him. It'was moved in arreft of judgment that there was no fuficient confideration ; fr the defendant was no party to this agreement, and was not liable to the plaintiff and therefore the plaintiff's forbearance was no benefit to the defendant ; fid non allocatur, for Hale faid, "When affumpfits firft grew into praficec"they ufed to fet out the matterlat large, viz. in fuch a cafe " as this, ,uodmutuo agreatumffaitinter eos, &c. andthey /hould be dif" chargedonte againfl the other. But fince, it'hath been the way to declare "9more concifely.' -And upon the whole matter here it appears thatthe " defendant agreedto the traiqferringof the debt to t,,flaintyf; and that "it was agreed he fhould be difcharged againft A."
Here then is an' affignment of a debt, and held to be valid becauft the debtor agreed to it. This was a precedent debt and was clearly a ,chofe in afion ; and if fuch a debt may be affigned by avfu ,fquent agreement of the debtor, a fortiorimay a debt be affigned which the debtor exprefsly makes affignable at the very moment of its creation. Its negotiability then becomes a part of the nature of the contrat ; it is a quality belonging to the debt itfelf, and enters into its very effence.
Another principle which feems to be well eftablifhed is, that hefr vhofe benhSt a promife is made, may maintain an aaion upon it, al-

If A. lends B. too dollars, for which B. gives A. his-promiffory note payable to -A. or order, the money thus delivered by A. to B. is delivered to be paid over by B. to a third perfon upon a contingency, viz. that A. fhall, by indorfement on the note, name the perfon to whom it is to be paid. This differs in nothing from the cafe of Core and Woddye, and the other cafes before cited, except that the third
eofirn is not named at the time of the delivery of the money to B.ut the cafe of Oble v. Dittlefield fhows, that the naming of a third perfon may be as well done after the debt is created, as at the time of its creation, provided the debtor agree to the transfer. Thefe principles certainly go far to prove that a contract for the payment of money, may be made negotiable in its nature by the confent of parties, on principles of. common law. It muff be an obifinate principle of law, indeed, and juftified by the ftrongeft reafons, that can prevent free agents from voluntarily entering into a contra& not injurious to themfelves, or others. Every contrad is to be conftrued according to the intention of the parties.
A contra& conflitutes the law between the contraffing parties, unlefs it be contrary to fome pofitive law, or prejudicial to fociety.
No good reafon can be given why a man fhould not be permitted to make his contrad negotiable.

In Hill v. Lewis, "iSalk. 132, 5 W . andM. Lord Holt laid, "for " the words or order" (this was in a promiffory note before the flatute of Anne) " give authority to the plaintiff to affign it by indorfement ; and " 'tis an agreement by the jl drawer that be would aZf/wer it to the af"fignee."
In ,ordan v. Barloe, 12 W. 3. 3 Salk. 67, it was "ruled that "cwhere a bill" (probably meaning a promiffory note) " is drawn, pay" able to W. R. or order, 'tis within the cuflom of merchants, and "fuch a bill may be negotiated and affigned by'cuftom, and the contrai ' of thb parties, and an aaion may be grounded on it, though 'tis no " fpecialty."
In Carter v. Palmer, 12 Mod. 380. 12 W. 1. upon a promiffory note payable to bearer, " all feemed to agree, if it were made payable " to him or order, the defendant by thatform had made it negotiable, afd " by confequence he would be liable to the aaion of affignee in his " own name."
In Clerk v. Martin, i Lord Ray. 757, x Anne, Shower, for the plaintiff, argued in the fame manner, ufing nearly lord Holt's own expreffions in the cafes juft cited; yet his lordfhip was "totis viribus" againift hit. Shower contended, " that this note, being payable to 9 the plaintiff or his order, was a bill of exchange, inafmuch as, by its ,, nature, it wa$, negotiable; and that diftinguifhes it from a note " payable to I. S. or bearer, which he admitted was not a bill of ex,, change, becaufe it is not afilgnable nor indorfable by the intent of the "fubfcriber, and confequently not negotiable, and therefore it cannot be " a bill of exchange, becaufe if is incident to the nature of a bill Qf " exchange to be negotiable: but hem this bill is negotiable, for if it " had been indorfed payable, to I, N., I. N. might have brought au " a&ion upon it, as upon a bill of exchange. Why then fhould it ,i not be before fuch indorfement a bill of exchange to the plaintiff ,, himfelf; ]ince the defindant by his fubfcription has ivewn his intent to be 99 liable to the payment of this money to the plaintiff or hij order; and t fince he hath thereby agreed that it ]hall be afignable a.er, which '- is by confequene. -that it fball 4c a bill of exchange;. and to mpkc

"fluch a note a bill of exchange can be no wrong to the defendani'l "becaufe he,. byfigning the note, has inade himfelf to that purpofe a cc m .rchant, and has given his confent that his notefiall be negotiated, and c his thereby fubje&ed himfelf to the law of merchants." Strong as ,his reafoning is, it was not fufficient to convince lord Holt. A fiilar argument by Brotherick produced no greater effed upon his lJrdffiip in the cafe of Budler v. Crips, 6 Mod. 29, 2 Anne, where it
j fla1i7d that "he that gave this note, did by the tenor thereof make it ' affignable or negotiable by the words or order, which amounts to a
promife or undertaking, to pay it to any whom hej~ould appoint, and the indorfement is an appointmentto the plaintiff."
But although his lordfhip would not acknowledge the weight of his own arguments, they have been duly appreciated by fubfequent judges.
In the cafe of Edie et aL. v. E. India company, Trin. z, G. 3. 2 Bur. 12t6, it was contended for the plaintiffs, " that a promiory " note or bill of exchange, originally made payable to one, or order, is, " in its own nature, aflignable ; and the aflignee has the whole interef cc in it, and may affign it as lie pleafes ; and any reftridion or. con" finement of his affignment of it, is contrary to the nature of the thing, " and therefore void." And the couinfel for the defendants admitted that fucli a bill of exchange " was negotiable in its nature." But they contended that an indorfoment to a man, without the words, or order, was no more than a naked authority to receive the money.
Lord Alan.field faid, "a draft drawn upon one perfon, dircing ,,him to pay money to another or order, is, in its originalcreation, not " an authority, but a bill of exchange, and is negotiable."
Mr.Jtilice Dennifon. "Where a bill is originally made payable to -"A. or order, it is of cour/e, and in it; very ea tice, negotiable, from hand cc to hand. An inland bill of exchange is affignable in its nature."c Foreign bills are equally fo by the law of merchants." " This is " matter of law: And the law is clearly and fully fixed. There is no c. inftance of a retric7ive limitation, where a bill is originally made pay.,able to a man or order." " In general the indorfement follows the $cnature of the thing indorfed , and is equally negotiable." " The cfl!aw has determined that the bfll is negotiable in itfef."

"And there is no difference whether th, determinations c' be on promiffory notes or on bills of exchange: it is juff the fame - thing ; becaufe it is to be governed by the fame rule."

On the part of the defendant it was contended "'that this was not a negotiable note, but only an authority " to receive fo much cafri. That it cannot be confidered as a negotiable
" bill of exchange ; for it was not accepted, nor indorfed, nor was it
" proteftable, nor entitled to any day of grace."
c The plaintiffs counfcl infifted that this bill or note was in itsna-
a ture negotiable; that fuch bills were in fa& a ways confidered as ne"gotiable, and a&ually negotiated, and commonly circulated as ca/h.
And if they t-,, from' the nature of the contraa, negotiable, the - finding of the jury can not alter the law." (4 They objea that it is " not a bill of exchange, becaufe it is not accepted, nor can be proteoi" ed, nor is entitled to a day of grace, nor is indor/able. But it is a i"negotiable inflrument. It is not neceffary that it flhould be a bill of " eoehange , an inland bill of exchange is niot like a foreign bill of ex- change ; for the former could not have been prot #ed before this " a& of parliament, nor needs to be fo fince the a; ; whereas a fo49 reign one always abfolutely required it." "c Whoever gives a note "payable to bearer, exprefsly promfes to pay it to every fair bearer; "however, an implied promife would fuffice for our iurpofe."

Lord Mansfield went into a minute examinationof the cafes of Nicholfon and Sedgwick, Horton and Coggs, and Hodges v.,'Steward, and faid that upon generalprinciples, they were not agreeable to law. cc It "is a: queftion of law whether a bill or note be negotiable or not. It "appears in the books that thefe notes are by law negotiable; and thc
plaintiff's maintaining his adion or not maintaining it, deperids up"on the queftion, whetherfjth a note is negotiableor not." Speaking of the decifions of lord Holt before the ftatute of Anne, he fays, "The %ocbjeaion was to bringing aft a6lion upon the note itfelf, as upon a "fpecialty; but I do not find it any where difputed, that an adion upon it an indebitatus a#umpflt generally, for money lent, might be brought
on a note payable to one or order." " But upon the fecond count, the prefent cafe is quite clear, beyond all d/ifnte; for undoubtedly, an ",a&ion for money had and received to the plainti's tfe, may be brought " by the bondfide bearer of a note made payable to bearer. There is 4' no cafe to the contrary. It was certainly money receidedfor the ufe of the ."original -advancerof it; and iffo, it is for the iifi of theperfon who It has the note as bearer."
Mr. Jujice Wilmot. "Probably the jury took upon themfelves to "9 confidur, whether fuch bills or notes as this is, were in their own 99 nature negotiable." But thii is a point of law; and by law they are Mnegotiable." And again he fays, " But this is a negotiablenote ; and (6the adion may be brought in the name of the bearer. Bearer is .4 defiriptio perfona,; and a perfon may take by that defcription, as "gwell as by any other. In the nature of the contra49 there is no im" propriety in his doing fo. It is a contral to pay the bearer, or to the "perfon to whom he/hall deliver it, (whether it be a note, or a bill of
exchange:) and it is repugnant to the cont,4itI that the drawer thould obje,. that ihe bearer has no right to demand payment from 4 him."

cc The reafons given in the cafes that are oppofite to ts (Hinton'a cafe, 2 Shower 235) are altogether .unfatisfa&ory. Thofe deter" minations frrike at this great br inch of commerce j if they were to "prevail they would put an end to all this fpecies of it."
"Even be/ore the ftatute of 3 and 4 Anne, lord chief jflice. Holt -9himfelf thought, that an indebitatus a/fqidpfit for money lent, or for " money had and received, might be maintained upon fuck a note : and " if it was a queftion antecedent to that a6t, I ihould frond by that " firft cafe of Hinton, rather than the latter ones which differ from it. " But that flatute was made exprefsly and on purpofe to obviate thefO "1doubts. However, if you 'would fuppofe it made to introduce a ne'e "law, ad that fiuch an a~lion could not be maintained l'efore the makint

" This now under confideration is a nigotiable inflrument, which I ,' think partakes more of the nature of a pronifory note, than of a -bill

Mr. uflice Yates, faid, " Nothing can be more peculiarly nego. c tiable than a draught or bill payable to bearer ; which is, in its no. 14 ture, payable from hand to hand, toties quoties.
cc It had been doubted, it is true, whether that fpecies of allion, where the plaintiff declares upon the note it/ ef, as upon a fpecialty, was pro" per ; but here is a count for mone , had and received to the pla.ntif'rs rfe. "The queftion whether he can bring this aftion, depends upon its being afignable or not.

A pradical expofition of thefe principles is to be found in the cafe of 'enner v. Mearej, -2W. B. 1269, which was an adion for money had and received brought by the a/ignee of a refpondentia bond, againft the obligor. The bond was payable to one Cox. The defendant, in the prefence 6f Cox, figned an indorfement on the bond, by which he acknowledged himfetf " bound to pay, to fuch affignee thereof as " fhould be duly appointed by him the faid James Cox, the whole of " the principal and intereft of the within bond, agreeably to the te"nor thereof, without any dedu&ion or abatement whatfoever."
It was objeaed for the defendant, that no general indebitatusafump. fit will lie where the debt arifes on a fpecialty, and if it did, yet the plaintiff ought to have recovered no more than he paid to the'affignor with common legal intereft.
For the plaintiff it was faid, that the obje&ion was only to theform of the a&ion; and the court would not grant a new trial contrary to equity. " But the form of the a&ion is well conceived. The in" dorfement is an a9umpfit by fingle contra&, as much as if made on O'a feparate paper a ter the aflignment had. Meares promifes to pay any "cone to 'whoin Cox/hould a/ign; befides the reiterated promife made to "Evans after Meares' return." 44 As for the damages and intertft, cc thofe muft purfue the terms of the originalcontraO 'which is nowo ,ctransferredto Fenner,
Blacjone,julice. " As this is entirely a new queftion, and I cannot, " upon fo fhort a confideration, forefee all the confequences attending 4,it, I thall avoid giving any czcifive opinion upon it. I cannot, for in. itftance, upon fo tranfient a view, difcern what effe& might be de" rived to the affets of a perfon deceafed, by thus turning a fpecialty " debt into a fimple contrad. And from this caution, rather than "from any great doubt attending this particular eaft, I chufe to deter"mine it upon plainer and more indifputable grofinds, arifing from " the evidence before us. The promife made by Meares to Evans" (a meffenger fent by the plaintiff to the defendant to give him notice of the affignment and to demand the money) "upon his return from In" dia, is clearly an affumpfit to Fenner. It would be a fufficient pro-
."mifeto avoid the ftatute of limitations. And the aflignment and " other tranfaffions are fully fufficient as a confideration, to make 09 that afftimpfit binding. Upon thtt ground it is therefore clear that a ," general indebitatusa§himn/t will li, 2d. As to the quantum of da-

When therefore the afignment is executedv 44 the money is demandable by virtue of that affiempft ; and of confe" qtuence this aaion well lies. I agree with my brother Blackflonc, " in refpe6d to the quantum of damages."
De Grey, chief juftice. " At the trial I gave an opinion that in point It o; law this aclion was maintainable, and I have feen no reafon to 6 change it. Were I now filent it might be thought I had. But I am , ill fa-tisfied that the a&ion wilt lie, abflra~edof the particularevidence " on which my brother Blackftone has founded his opinion. Refpon. " dentia bonds have been found effentially neceffary for carrying on " the Indian trade. But it would clog thefe fecurities, and be proSdud-ive of great inconvenience, if they were obliged to remain in " the hands of the firft obligee. This contraCt is therefore devjfed, " to operate upon fubfequent affigninents ; and amounts to a declara" tion that, uponfuch a/ignment the money, which I have fo borrowed, "Jha/! no longer be the money of A. but of B. hisfubatitute. The plaintift ' is certainlyentitledto the money in confciencc,, and the'efore, I think, enti"' tled alfo at law ; for the defendant has .promifed to pay any perfon that -'/hall be entitled to the money."
It will be obferved that there is no difference between the ground of ·lackftone's opinion, and that of the other judges, excepting in ,this, that the former chofe to ground his opinion upon the verbal promife made after the affignment, and the others refted it ;upon the written promife on the back of the bond, made before the affignment'; but all muft have agreed that the debt was aff'gnable, with the affent of the debtor.
The cafe of Innes v. Dunlop, 8 T. R. 595, was by the affigire 4of a Scotch bond, againft the obligor. There were two fpccial counts, and four money counts. To the two fpecial counts the defendaat demurred.
" Oty/ow, fergeant, in fupport of the demurrer, obicted that the I plaintiff, who was merely the affignee of a ch~le in ai~ion, could not 41 fue in his own name, but ihould have brought the aCtion in tho " name of Hunter and co. the obligees in the bond. But,
"1The Court- after obferving that this was ftot an affion on the bond, 49 faid that they were clearly of opinion that the eagnment of the bond

" And therefore they gave judgment for the plaintf." In a note to thxs cafe, the reporter refers to the cafe of Fenner and Meares, 2 B. rep. t269, before cited. Although the declaration fRates, that " by " reafon of the premifes," (viz the making of the bond and the afo fignment to the plaintiff) ccand according to the la'w of Scotland, the " defendant became, and was indebted to the plaintiff," and being fo
" indebted, in confideration thereof promifed to pay," &c. yet the
law of Scotland does not feem to be the ground of the judgment, but the court rely entirely upon the afflignment of the bond being a fufficient
confideration for the affumpfit, agreeably to judge Blackftone's opinion in F/enner and .Meares.

The cafe of Reedy. Ingraham, 3 Dall.505, isa ftrong cafe in fup-

port of the principle that a contrad may be made negotiable by the in-.

amount of the difference, due on the contra&, which-was expreffed

in thefe words, " On the x8th of April, 1792, 1 promife to receive

Upon a policy of infurance, the perfon interefted is allowed to bring an aCtion in his own name, although not mentioned in the policy. i Shower, iS6.

To thefe authorities may be added that of the cafe of Gerardv. La
Cofle et al. i Dallas 194.
From all thefe cafes it feems to be a maintainable propofition that a man may make his debt negotiable, notwithftanding the principle that a chofe in action cannot be affigned. Indeed that principle feems to have been introduced for the purpofe of preventing the creditor from transferring his right of action contrary to the will of the debtor, but was not intended to apply to thofe cafes where the debtor had exprefsly 2uthorifed his creditor to affign it.
4. The fourth point is that no indebitatus afiany/lt will lie without privity.
This idea feems to have been founded upon the exploded doctrine, a-at indebitatusaftiimpfit will lie only iqcafe where debt will lie. But

APPENDIX.
even admitting the latter propofition to be true, yet it will not apply ) for in the cafe of Core and Woddye (and the other cafes cited which were dependant upon it) it was held that if a man receives money to my ufe I may maintain an aCtion of debt againfft him for it.
Plowden, in the cafe of Plattv. Locke, Pach. e, Ed. 6, which was an aftion of debt againif the fheriff for an efcape, frI. 36, (a. and 3.) fays, cc And fo it appears that the aCtion upon the matter was maincc tainable, although there was not any contra&t between them ; for cc upon a liberatedelivered to the clerk of the Hanaper, who has afcc fetsin his hands, an ation of debt will lie againft him, as appears " by t H. 7, and yet there is not any contraRt between them, nor any "9privity in words; and fo in many like cafes."
In the cafe of Wherwood v. Shaw, 44 Eliz. x Brownlow 82, it was cd adjudged that although no contrat was between the parties, yet when " either money or goods are delivered, upon confideration, to the ufe "of A ; 4. may have an afion of debt. And of that opinion was Mon"tague, 28 H. 8, in Core and Woddye's cefe ; and alfo there is a prece" dent of fuch aftions in the book of Entries." relv. 23, S. C.
In i Salk. 27, J7acob v. Allen, an executor brought an a&ion for money had and received againft an attorney of an adminiftrator, who had been appointed before it was known that there was a will, and it was held to lie, although the attorney hadpaidit over tothe admin/lrator before ai~ion broughr. Here certainly was no privity of contra&.
in 2 W. BL. 83 o , Hitchen v. Campbell, it is faid by the court that, ('The fame principle which fupports this aftion againft one who re" ceives money from the bankrupt himrelf, will fupport it againft ', another who receives it under the bankrupt. "In both cafes it is the " property of the affignees. -And though while this aL7ion was in its in"fancy (2 ones 126, 2 Lev. 245.) the courts endeavored to find tech9 nicalargumentstofupport it, as by a notion ofPRIVITY, &C. yet that "principle is too narrow to fupport thefe aftions, in general, to the c extent to which they are admitted." In the fame cafe as reported in " 3 Wilfon 304, it is faid by the court, " Whoever has received the "t money for the bankrupt's goods io fuppofed in juftice to have re" ceived the fame for the ufe of the affignees, in whom the property ", of thofe goods was, by law, vefted; and to have promifed to pay " the fame to the afignees ; there is a fuppofed privity of contrai? be" tween the perfons whofe money it lawfully is, and the perfon who has got " or received ii."

APPENDIX.
The fame ideas are fuggefted by lord Mansfield in the cafe of Hawkes ,v. Saunders, Corwp. 29o. Indeed among the innumerable cafes in which the a&ion for money had and received is the proper remedy, fearcely one can be found in which there exifts any privity of contradl between the parties.
It lies to recover fees received by the defendant clairng a right to the plaintiff's office; as in the cafe of Howardv. Wood, 2 7ones, 126. 1 Freem. 473, 478, where the action was brought to try the plaintiff's title to the office of Steward of a Court Baron. " It was " objected for the defendant, that this aaion did not lie, but only a " fpecial ation on the cafe ; and that this a(ion is not only improper 9 but contrary to the truth of the cafe ; for the plaintiff declares upon " afumpfit for money received by the defendane to the i fe of theplaintiT, I and the jury find that the defendant received the money to his ooi " ufe, claiming the office of fteward in his own right, and the money CCas fees incident to the office, which he had exercifed contrary to the " zvillofthe plainti5, and not otherwife due than by the exercife of
" the office. That this money was incident to the tort done by the " defendant in the exercife of the office, and where a receipt depends 4 merely on a tort, there can be no contra8, or prisity, and without thefe " no debt, and by confequence ind.,bittitus afumpfit does not lie." " But it was refolved by the whole court that the ation lay ; for this is c an expeditious remedy to facilitate the recovery of jufl rights ; and "9this manner of adion has now prevailed for a long*time; and the c point had been ruled often by the judges in their circuits, and 49afions frequently brought in this manner; and lately upon folemn "6 argument in the court of exchequer, in the cafe of Dr. Aris, " 2 Mod. 26o, who brought fuch ation for the profits of the office 41of comptroller in the port of Exeter, it was refolved by the lord " chief Baron and all the court that the aCtion lay." Here the fame exception was exptefsly over-ruled, which is now fet up in the prefent adion; and it has been uniformly over-ruled ever fince. The fame points were made and overruled in the cafe of Dr.Aris above cited ; and the court faid that inaebitatusaffumpfit will liefor rent received by one whopretends a title, and cited 4 H. 7, 6,, (b.). and Moor 458. This was alfo agreed in 12 Mod. 324. Huf#ey v. Fiddall.

clearly fhow that the want of privity is no objeftion to the a~tion of indebitatus alfumpft for moiey had and received. . If then the want of privity is no bar, what is there to prevent the plaintiff from recovering againft the defendant ? Is it that he is not in juftice entitled to the oohey ? Or has the defendant a right to retain it ? It is admitted that
the plaintiff, may look to the intermediate indorfer, and that he may recover from the defendant. The objeftion then is that the defendant is not liable to the prefent plaintiff, but to the intermediate indorfer, who alone is liable to the plaintiff. But the plaintiff may fue in the name of the intermediate indorfer, " for," as lord Holt fays in Bullet v.* Crips, " the indorfement amounts at leai to an agreement. " that the indorfee fhould fue for the money in the name of the in"1 dorfer and receive it to his own ufe 9" aind.this court will prevwit

APPENDIX.
tfie intermediate indorfer from releafing the a&ion, and from interfering in any other manner to fruftrate the plaintiff's fuit. Befides, a recovery and fatisfadion in the prefent a&ion will be a bar to any a~tion which the intermediate indorfer may bring againft the prefent defendants on the fame note. Complete juftice is done between both parties in the fhortelt, leaft expenfive, and leaft oppreffive manner; and that circuity of alion, which the " law abhors," is avoided. If the plaintiff recover againft the intermediate indorfer, and he againft the defendant, the judgment will come down upon the defendant charged with the heavy expenfes of two fuits inftead of one. The plaintiff will be turned roun l upon a mere point of form, and perhaps may lofe the debt altogether by the .infolvency of the intermediate indorfer. If the indorfements are in blank the plaintiff may ftrike tut the intermediate indorfements and declare as the immediate indorfee of the firit indorfer. Evans on bills 15, i Efp. Rep. igo, Smith v. Clark, for a blank indorfement authorizes the holder to fill it up with what he pleafes, confiftent with the nature and tenor of the inflrument. So that if privity i6 neceffary, it is in the power of the plaintiff to raife it. But the cafes before cited Thow that privity is not neceffary to fupport the affion for money had and received; and from the nature of the thing it can not be neceffaty in. any cafe where the inftrument is negotiable, whether it be made fo by the cuftom of merchants, by pofitive ftatute, or by the contrail f -heparties.
S. The fifth propofition is that a promife in writing, without a conlideration expreffed, is nudumpalum.
This do~trine of nudumpaaum feem6 not to be well fettled, although much has been faid upon the fubje&.
It was confiderably difcuffed in the cafe of Pillan v. Van Mierop, 3 Bur. 1663, but as there were other principles in that cafe, it was not neceffary to decide abfolutely upon this point. Yet the whole court feemed ftrongly inclined to the opinion that the rule, ex nudo palos'non oritur a&io, did not apply to a promife in writing. Lord Mansfield Tfaid, " A nudum pa&um does not exift in the ufage and law of
merchants.
" I take it, that the ancient notion about want of confideration was " for the fake of evidence only; for when it is reduced to writing, as a in covefhants, fpecialties, bonds, &c. there was no objeqtion to the "want of confideration. And the Jiatuteof frauds proceeded upon the 'fame principle. In commercial cafes amongft merchantp, the ware " of confideration is not an objetion."

kfr.juglice Wilmot. " I can find none of thofe cafes that go upon 46 its being nudumpatum, that are in 'writing; they are all uponbparol. " I have traced this-matter of nudum pazum ; and it is very curious. If He then explained the principle of an agreement being looked upon " as , nudum patum, and how the notion of nudumpaum firflt came "6 into our law. He faid it was echoed from the civil law. 6Ex nuI dopa-o non oritur aaio.' Vinnius gives the reafon in Lib. 3, tit. de
· obligationibus, 4 to Ed. 596. If by fliptdation, (and afortiori, if by "writing) it was good without confideration. But it was made requi-
ite in order to put people upon attention and refle&ion, and to " prevent obfcurity and uncertainty : and in that view either writing
or certain formalities'were required. id. on Julinian4 to Ed..614 . Therefore itwas intended ',as a guard againft rafh, inconfiderate, " declarations : but if an undertaking was entered into upon de/ibera"tion and ref-tS/ion it had aa-ivity ;' and fuch promifes were binding. "Both Grotius and Pufendorf hold.them obligatory by the law of na" tions. Grot. lib. 2. c. i i. deprom/is. Puff. ib. 3. c. S. They are morally good, and only require afcertainment. Therefore there is " no reafon to extend the principle, or carry it farther. There would " have been no doubt upon the prefent cafe, according to the Roman " law; becaufe here is both' ]iulation (inthe exprefs Rorhan form)
9 and writing."
Mr. Juftice Wilmot then refers to.a pafTage in Braaon which will be confidered prefently, ind proceeds thus, " Our own lawyers have If adopted exatly the fame idea as the Roman 'law. Plowden, 308, (b.)' If in the cafe of Sherynton and Pledalv. Strolton and others, mentions ." it : and no one contradieted it. He lays down the diftindion be44 tween contraffs or agreements in words (which are more bafe) and 4 contrafts or agreements in writing (which are more high) ; and puts " the difinftion upon the want of deliberation in the former cafe, " and the full exercife of it in the latter. His words are the marrow "9 of what the Roman lawyers had faid. cWords pafs from men cc lightly;' but where the agreement is made by deed, there is more flay,
&c." " The delivery of a deed is a ceremony in law, fignifying fully his good will that the thing in the deed hould pafp from him 4' who made the deed, to the other ; and therefore a deed, which - muPt neceffarily be made upon great thought and deliberation, (hall 19 bind, without regard to the confideration." " The voidnefs of the " confideration is the fame in reality, in both cafes : The reafon of " adopting the rule was the fame in both cafes; though there is a cdifference in the ceremonies required by' each law. But no inlff. " cay arifes merely from the naked promife. Therefore if it Rood only I upon the naked promife, its being in this cafe reduced into writing,

APPENDIX.
4c is afuJffiienl guardagaingfiirprize; and therefore the rule of nudum "padum does not apply in the prefent cafe.
"I can not find, that a nudum pafiian evidenced by writing has ever ,been holdenbad ; and I fhould think it good: though where it is c merely verbal, it is bad. Yet I give no opinion upon its being good *' alwa s when in writing." " It has been melting down into com" mon fenfe, of late times."
Yates anid Afton, juftices, concurred in opinion, nearly on the fame grounds.
This opinion of the court in Pillansv. Van Afierop, does not feem to be contradicdted by any fubfequent cafe, fo far at leaft as it affirms this principle,. that a written promife carries with it prim facie evidence of a good confideration, (until the contrary appears ;) and throws the burthen of proof upon the oppofite party. So that in an a6tion between the original parties, upon a promife in writing, it does not feem to be neceffary to aver a confideration:* Blackflone's opinion, (2 Co". 446,) goes further than this, for he fays, " if a man gives a
"' At the time this argument was made, the writer had not feen the cafe of Paxn v. BEgbes, in the Houfe of Lords, reported in a note to the cafe of Mitchnfon -v. Hewfqn, "7'. R. 350, which is faid, in a note to tl"'. 3 d edition of. Doug. 683, to have been decided :4th of May, 1778, and to be rcported in 7 Br. Parl. cafes, 55o. Nor is the cafe mentioned by Powell or Fonblanque hi treating of this fubje&.
The Lord Chief Baron Skynter, in delivering the opinion of the judges, has thefe ohfervations. " 3ut it is faid that if this promife is in writing, that takes away the neceffity
of a confideration, and obviates the objeffion of nudum pansm, for that cannot be where " the promife is put in writing ;" " but whatever may be the rule of the civil law, there " is certainly none fuch in the law of England. His lordfliip oherved, upon the dodtrine 4' of nudum padtum by Mr. J Wilmot, in the cafe of Pillans va. Van .Mierop and HoPRYS, 1 .1 Bar. "1663, and that he contradided himfelf, and was alfo contradiied by tinnimi in " his 'coniment on Ju7lintan.
" All contraas are by the laws of Englanddiftinguifhld into agreements, by eialty, "4 and agreements byparol; nor is there any fitch third clafg, as fone of the counfel have " endeavored to maintain, as. contra&5 in writing. If they be merely written, and not
fip'ecialties, they are parol, and a confideration muft be proved But it is faid that the " ftatute of frauds has taken away the neceflly of any confideration in this cafe; the fla" tute of frauds was made for the relief of perfonal reprefentatives and others, and did not " intend to charge them further than by common law they were chargeable His lord" fhip here read thofc fe6tions of that flatute which relate to the prefent fubje&. He ob' ferved that the words were merely negative, and that executors and adminiftrators " fliuld not be liable out of their own eflates, unlefs the agreement upon which the
adtion was briught, or fome memorandum thereof, was in writing and figned by the " party But this does not prove that the agreement was fiill not liable to be tried " aqd judged ot, as all other agreements in writing are, by the common law, and does " not-prove tlte concverfe of the propofition, that, when in writing, the party mulf be, " at all events, liable He here obferved upon the cafe of Pillans v. Vat 1ie'r p, in Bur. 1 and the cafi, of LoJZ ,v Willianfon, Micb 16 G 3. in B R ; and fo far as thefe cafea ""went on the doctrine of nudum padtum, he feemed tointim-ite that they were erronc1ois. Hc faid that all hisbrothers concurred with him, that in thia caft thcre was nut

" promm~ory note, be ]hall not be allowed to aver the want of a cofde" ration in order to evade the payment; for every note from the fub-
"fiription of thc draitrer," 'c carries with it internal evidence of a good 6ceonfideration." 'he cafe, however, which he cites from lord Raym. 76o, does not bear him out in the full extent of his propofition ; for the court faid, that " though no confideration was expreffed.in Hurft' " note, yet the note, being fubfcribed 1*t Hur), was good evidence of 99 a debt due from Hurl to the plaintiff."
There is certainly a difference between good evidence, and incontrovertible, or eonclyufive evidence. The expreffion good evidence, feems to imply only Primdfacie evidence. And this feems to be the extent pf the proportion, as it applies in an aation between the original parties to a note, for when it is negotiated and the adtiori is between an indorfee and the maker, the latter will not be allowed to aver the want'of a confideration, becaufe " its operation is then governed by " the fame law as a bill of exchange, which is the law merchant; and " that is founded upon the law of natureand nations,in which the want " of a confideration is no eflential defedt in a contra&," (z Powellon 4"contraf.r,34,) and in which the great leading principle is, fides e7 ecfervan&. i Fnb. 338, not, (d.)

Powell and Fonblanque h,-ve both controverted the dotrine as laid
down by lWilmot, in the cafe of Piflans v. Van Mier.p, and by Black-
ftone in the paflage above cited ; but their arguments only go to prove
that a note in writing is not concf'ive and incontro'uertbleevidence of %good confideration, between thet original parties ;- and it is believed a cafe can not be found in'which the plaintiff has been put to prove the confideration of a written promife, by a mere denial on the part of the dekndant. It feems to be the rule, that the plaintiff is not obliged to

Sa fi;Mfcient confidratiemn to funport this demand, as a psrfonal demand againl the defendant, and that its being now fuppofcd to be in writing makes no difference."

This care, as far as it go"., mut be confidered as having decided the law in England, where the decifions of the h*ghefl court of judicature are regarded as binding But in this country it can only be refpced as an opinion; and the queltion is JIll open as to the

rounds of that opinion. It ;s not contended that a promife in writing can not le a udum palrum; but the

whfion is whether the burden of proof is not thrown upon the promifor ; or whetherthe airting does not raife a prima facie prefumption of a Srood confideration. How far this sefllion is affected by the cafe of Rann and Huges, is left to the confideration of the reader:
If a promiffory note is admitted to be a mercantile inflrument, and 'governed by the raw nrhant, the queflioa of sudum paifum can not arife in the prefent cafe For it is ellevcd to he fettled law, that " a auduw Oa~um does not exiii in the ufage and law of

merchants."

APPENI IX.
prove the Confideration of fuch a promife, until the defendant has proved circumfitances tending to deliroy the prefumption arifing from the written contra&. Powell and Fonblanque have taken oppo ite premifes, and yet both draw the fame conclufion. The former fays, (inhis efay on the law of contrals, Vo1. I.P. 340..) " Now it feems " reafonable to conje&ure, that when this maxim of the Roman law,
quod ex nudo pacto non oritur atijo," was adopted and received iiuto 4our fyftem, it was adopted in its full extent."
Fonblanque, (Vol I.p. 326, note a.) fays, "The civil law is fo generally referred to in the difeuffion of this fubje&, that it may be ma" terial to take a curfory view of the different means by which a legal "obligation was created by that law, in order, to fhew, that though we have borrowed the phrafe nudum paum from the civil law, and ti" rule which decides upon the nullity of its effed, yet that the commnino " law has not in any degree been influenced by the notions of the civil law, in "dftning what conjflitutes nudum paLdum."
He then cites authorities to fhow that by the civil law a promife in writing might be a nudum paTum, and therefore not capable of fupporting an aaion, and hence fems to infer that fuch is the rule of the common law.
However, both Wilmot and Blackftone are fupported by Braaon, who appears to be the firft writer upon the Erglifh law, who has noticed the doCtrine of nudumpactum. Brac7on, has certainly interwoven many of the principles of the civil law with his obfervations on the common law, but it, ii believed he has done it only in cafes where the common law ha recognized thofe principles. The paffages of Brcton, alluded to by Wilmot, in the cafe before cited, are the following: .Book 3d."c. i. §.-2p.. 99. edition, 1640. " Videndum eft etiam uncle aCtio oritur ? Et fciendum eft quod ex obligationibus, tanquam ai matre, fitia. Obligatio autem, que eft mater aftionis, originem ducit et initium ex aliqua cara pracedente, five ex contrafu vel quaff, five ex maleficio vel quc/i. Ex contra&u vero oriri poterit multis modis, ficut ex conventione, per interrogationes et refponfiones, ex conceptione verborum qu, voluntates duorum in unum trahit confenfum, ficut funt papa, conventa, qui :uda funt aliquando, aliquando vefita. qu'e, fi nuda .uerint, exinde wnn fequitur aTio, quia ex ;udo pato non nafcitur ah7io. Oportet igitur quod habeat veflinenta, de quibus inferius dicendum eft.-In the next chapter, §.i, in the fame page 1e tells us what are thofe veiimenta which prevent pacts from being nude.
hit enim obligatio, quafi contra ligatio, et quatuor habet fpecies. 'quibus contrahitur, et phra veftimenta. Contghitur euzim re, verbis,

APPENDIX.
frripto, confcnfu, traditione, junCtura, quxe omnia dicuntur ve/inmewa paCtorum."
And in §. 9, of the fame chapter, he fays, " Inventae autem funt hujufmodi ftipulationes et obligationes ad hoe, quod unufquifque habeat et fibi acquirat quod fu, intereft, fi contra ea agatur quxe in fipulationem deducuntur. Et fi rcs in ftipulatione dedu6ta aii ietur,
nihilominus intererit flipulatoris, quia ille qui promijt, tenebitur ad
intereffe, vel ad pcenam, fi pocna fuerit in ftipulationem dedu&a."
"c Per fJripturam ver 6 obligatur quis, ut fi quis ferijferit alicuife debere, five pecunia numerata fit, five non, obligatur ex fcriptura, nec habebit exceptionem pecuniae non numerate contra fcripturam, quia Jcripfit fe debere. Et non folum obligatur quis per verba, fed per fcripturam, et per literas, non ut literxe quidem ipfX, vel figura literarum obliget, fed oratio fignificativa quat. exprimunt litere; fed utrumque cooperatur ad obligationem, oratio fignificativo curn litLra."
Thefe expreffions of Bradon are ifrong and clear ; and if he is to be confidered as only borrowing terms from the civil law to exprefs his ideas of the common law, they are certainly conclufive.
The reafon of the rule feems to be truly given by Plowden, in the cafe cited by Mr. Juftice Wilmot ; and if a written promife is not within the reafon of the rule, it would feem that the rule cannot apply. In the ancient books no notice is taken of any written agreements but thofe under feal ; and the reafon probably is that in thofe times by far the greater part of the people could not write, 40 as to fign their names to an inftrument. Hence a feal was fubftitutcd for a fignature ; not becaufe it was a more folemn a&, but from the neceffity of the cafe. Wineffes alfo were produced for identifying the feal, and not to add *to the obligation of the contrad. But the dij. ference between fealed inftruments and others, has now become obfolete in pradice ; for there is no cafe of a tontrad, where the interefis of third perfons are not involved, in which the defendant may not either at law or in equity, avail himfelf of the want of confideration. And the moft trifling confideration is now'held fuficient to take evenl parol contrads out of.the rule of nudumpad7um.
In Styles 419, Bunnitworth v. Gibbs, chief juftice Roll faid, "a litcc tie confideration will ferve to ground a promife on." Blackjyone, 2 Com. 445, fays, "6 any degree of reciprocity will prevent the pad "4 from being nude." And Wi/mot, 3 d Bur. 1666, faid, " the leaji dcfpark of a confideration will be fufficient." In Fenner v. Meares,

APPENDIX
,7V . B1. 127T, Judge Blackftone faid, that "the afignment and
- other tranfaaions were fully fufficient as a confideraion to make " the affumpfit to the affignee binding." And in Hawk s v. Saunders, Co',p. 29 o , lord Mansfield faid, that " a legal or equitable duty is a " fuflicient confideration for an a~tual aflihmpfit ;"and that it " was " too narrow ground" to fay that " there muff be either an immedic ate benefit to the party promifing, or a lofs to the pei fon to whom " the promife was made." And Buller declared the true rule to be, " that wherever a defendant is under a moral obligation, or is liable - in confcience and equity to pay, that is a fuflicient confidera tion." But even admitting that the rule of widuon paThum applies to written contraffs, yet in the prefent cafe there is a fufficient confideration. For according to judge Blackilone, ',the affignment and other tranf4actions," and particularly the payment of the money by the intermediate indorfer to the defendant, were certainly fufficient confiderations to fupport the affumpfit.
Upon the whole, therefore, whether this cafe be confidernJ upon the grouna of a promifibry note befo.e the ifttute of Anne, or upon general principles of common law, the count for money had ard received, feems to be well fupportcd by the evidence offered.
IX. It is believed that no cafe has been reported in Virginia in which this queftion has been decided. .'here are cafes, however, which may poflibly be confidered as aired'ing fome of the principles involved in the prefent enquiry.
In Mackie and Davis, 2 1J/'bi1. 229, it is held that the (,ognee of a bond may maintain indebitatus aflfumpfit for money had and received againft the affignor, upon principles of common law. 'here are, in that cafe, feveral affertions and admiffions of counfel which are deemed not to be correed, but are warranted only by a few immature obfervations of fome of the writers fince the flatute of Anne, One of the counfel feems to confider the cuftom of mcrchants as no part of the common law. This has been fhewn to be an incorrcd pofition, by the concurrent adjudications of a long feries of years It is faid alfo that c as to promiffory notes, the right of recovery agatIuL thO 9 indorfer is exprefsly given by the flatute of Anne, and from this c provifion, an invincible argument is to be drawn in favouLir" of the defendant, c for if in a commercial country like England, it was nc" ceffary for the legiflature to provide a remedy agfinll the indorfir of " a promiflbry note, it is obvious that no fuch right exifted at coni" mop law." But if the flatute of Anne was in affirnice of the taw as it flood before, and only enaded to remove the delbts which
,3

APPENDIX.
had been raifed bylord Holt's decifion in Clerk v. Martin, then tfiisargument totally fails. And that fuch was the faal is believed to be" proved by the authorities before cited.
One of the counfel for the plaintiff confidered the cafe as flanding on the fame ground af notes of hand did bfbre the flatut of Anne ; and denies that notes were within the cuftom of merchants, for which lie ctes Kyd as an authority; but Kyd fays only " that it 'was held," &c. and relies on the cafe of Clerk v; Martin, and the preamble of the ftatute. And in the fame manner, every like affertion in the modern books may be traced up to the fame fource. The only authority which can fupport the pofition is the cafe of Clerk v. .Martin. The ftatute of Anne h'aving put the queftion at reft, no one has taken the pains to examine the real ftate of the law prior to the ffatute, but one writer after another has, repeated the affertion without the leafL examinat'on. In England it is of no importance whether they are :orre& or not i but in this country, where few of the ftates have idopted the ifatute, it becpnies interefting to know how the law really ftood before. In the cat'e of Mackie and Davis, the counfel and the court place much reliance on the privity between the indorfer and his. immediate kindorfee, and it is eviklent that they borrowed their ideas from Kyd on bills 1 14. But Kyd cites no authority for his obfervations . nor are they warranted by any adjudged cafe, at leaft fo far as they apply to the aaion for money had and received, Judge Roanefays, " The cafe of promiffory notes will be an important guide, and "therefore it will be proper to fee how they ftood previous to the fta" tute which it is fuppofed created the liability of the indorfer of
them.'" Buthe proceeds no farther in his invefligation than to the " cafe of Lambert v. Oakes, 2aoth May, 11, W-. 3 He fays, thicc cafe was decided antecedent to the flatute of Anne, and was confe1 quently governed by the principles of the common law." If he confidered the cuftom of merchants, as part of the common law (as it really is) he was certainly corre&.' But the probabilityris that the declaration was in that cafe grounded on the cuflom of merchants: ft, becaufe that was the ufual and eftablifhed form of declaring on promifibry notes in thofe days: 2dly, becaufe there had not at that time been a diflin&ion difeovered between a promiffory note and an inland bill of exchange. 3dly, Becaufe there never was, either before or fince the flatute of 'Anne, - time when an i.-difedpromiffbry note, was not confidered as a bill of exchange ; and 4tbly, becaufefour, out of the five reporters of that cafe call it a bill of exchange, and even lor l Raymond himfelf calls it a bill throughout his whole report, except in th. firft line, whcre he calls it a note

A7?PENDIX.
Julge Roane further fays, that " Bonds, in England, are not af*' fignable, and therefore fRand in the fame fituation as notes of hand -' did at the time when this cafe was determined." It is believcd, tip,on the authority of the cafes already cited, that therc never was a. time when a promiffory note payable to order was not affignable, and, even lord Holt, fubfequent to'the cafe of Cleik v. Martin, 'admitted, in the cafe of Buller v. Crips, that an indorfement of fuch a Tiote would create a negotiable bill.
In the cafe of Morton v. R?/e, 2 W-aJ9. 240, the counfel admit that goldfmiths notes " circulatedlike bills of exchange" before the ftatute of Anne, and yet it is contended that promiffory notes derived their whole negdtiability from the fIatute. But do/fmiths notes were fimply promig/biy notes, and were not more negotiable than the prcmiflory notes of any other defeription of perfons. Again, the famev counfel obferves, " that though notes of hand, according to the fta9tute of Anne, -were placed on the fame ground with bills of ex" change, and of courfe governed by the fame rules, the.legiflature
c' of 1748, by affimilatiig them in every retpe& to bonds, rendered " them unlike-to bils of exchange in this country, and thereby gave a cc convincing proof that it was not their intention to fuffer bonds to
be governed by thofe rules which ap,lid to bills." And in confirmation of his argument le cites D,dl. Rep. 23. Judge Roane o1b ferves, " that notes.of hand are now affignable in EDg.land, and it is ," admitted that the atfignee is difcharged of any equity.which exiffet
c againft the affignor,, unlefs the note was given for an ufurious oi if gaming confideration. The reafion of this is, not that the principle s' attached to them is alegal confecluence of their being made affignacc ble, but becaufe this rule, for cominercialpucpofes, applied to bills of cc exchange ; and the ftatute of Anne, declaring notes affignable in ,' like manner as bills of exchange, fhewed an intention, as it is was fupc' pofed, to render the former as highly negotiable, and as current in o internal, as the latter were in external commerce. The a61 of our #( affembly embraces equally the fubje6t of bonds and notes, but con.49 tains no exprelions tending to induce a bdif that the making them qiffgnc, able was intendedfor purpofes of commerce. The defign certainly wa' ,i to make them transferable to a certain extent; the proviionpoiuts out * the limits of their negotiability, and fixes a firong mark of difiincEion 4( between them and bills of exchange. As to the latter they were of always affignable, and the indorfenent transferred a legal righlt to cc the indorfee." They did not oxve this quality to flatntay pro" vifions, and of courfe thcy continued within -that principle which
had ,ttached to them, and of which they were not deprived by any v' Ratute." He then cites the cafe of Peacock vi Rhodes, Doul. 636 ,

APPENDIX.
where lord Mansfield obferves that the indorfee of a promif'lory note or bilt of exchange is not to be confidered in the light of an affignee at common law, becaufe it would Rop their currency and injure trade and coiincrce.
He then proceeds. - It is therefore, not becaufe the indorfee is " the affignee of the legal right to fuch bills and promiffory notes, that c the equity is barred by the indorfemant, but becaufe of their qual" ity as a currency, and from the necefflty of adopting fuch a princi" pie, for the convenience of trade and commerce with refped to fuch ," currency. But bonds are not to be confidered as a currency, and " within the reafon of the principle laid down in Peacoek v. Rhodes; "cfor that principle is founded on commercial canfiderationsaltogether, "9 and not upon a diflinaion between legal and equitable affignments." " The provifion of this a6t has long governed the affignment of bonds, "9 and it is but of late 'ears that the exiftence of fuch a principle, as " has been contended for in this- caufe, has been thought of as appli" cable to bonds and notes."
Carrington, Yuflice. "To confider this cafe upon general prlnci-c ples ; the queftion is whether an equity, originally attached to a 4c bond, follows it into the liands of an afignee without notice. In "t England, notes of hand uvre not aJfIgnable until the 3d and 4 th of 4 9ueen'Anne, fo as to enable the affignee to bring fuit in his own ,c name. Courts of equity were of couift reforted to, where the maker W9 of the note was not precluded from fetting up any equitable defence " which he might have. Frequent attempts were made by the bankers " and traders to bring them within the cuftorn of merchants, and to
place them, upon the fame footing of negotiability with bills of C exchange. But thejudgesfill cotridered them merely as evidences of I"debt. At length the Qatute was procured, conformably ith the
wifhes of the trading part of the community, making them affign-, able, in like manner as bills of exchange. The likenefs thus tirongly a fandioned by lejiflative authority, produced fimilar decifions in " cafes where their negotiability was concerned. But no efforts were If made in favour of bonds, and they remain in the fame fituation 4, in England as they flood at cot-Amon law. This country was then "9 a part of the Britifh empire, and our legiflature affimilated its laws 4c to thofe of the mother country fo far as our locM fituation and ftate "c of fociety authorized it. In 1705, fhortly after the Englifh ftatutt " pafred refpealing notes of hand, the affembly paffed a law authoriz" ing the alfignment of bonds and notes. -This law I cannot meet with, but it was repealed by proclamation in 1730, and in the fame *' year another law was enacted exaffly fimilar to the af of 1748.

APPENDIX.
*'With the Englifla fl-tute before their eyes the legiflature (lid not " chfe to adopt it altogether, or to introduce into it a principle " which fhould defeat the equity of tht obligor, as it was facurcd to " him at common law. Thofe exprefions, in the itatute, which ",affimilated notes to bills of exchange, were omitted in our law, and " in the room of them, others were introduced, which eftablifhed an 4,oppofing principle. The negotiability of bonds and notes was quali",fled and refirided within bounds confiftent with the, commercial " ftation of this country. There was no neceffity for exalling thofe ",kinds of paper to the high gr~undon which the comn.ercl world had cc placed bills of exchangc, and the whole complexion of the law ,,fhews that it was intended to be avoided. The docIrine which has " been ftated and relied upon, as applicable to foreign bills of ex" change, is confequently inapplicable to the prefent difcuffion. Thefe ' confiderations have produced conclufions in the public mind, as to " the conftru&ion of the law in queflion, the very reverfe of what" has been contended for by the counfel tor the appellee. I fhould
be unwilling to unfettle thefe long formed opinions, unlefs the " expreffions of the law rendered it abfolutely neceffary. That a
bond, fraudulent and void in its creation, can not be cleanfed of its impurity, and rendered valid, by aflignment, is fettled by the cafe " of Tnrton v. Benfon, and has uniformly been fo decided in the ",courts in this country. No man can, by the mere a& of affign"c ment, transfer a greater intereft than he holds; 'difpofe of an incc tereft where he has nothing, or make good and valid, that which
c was originally vicious and void. In this enlightened age though, ccformer decifions are rejeaed, and a new mode of attaining juffice " is difcovered. But is it true that the means are adequate to the ob"jet ? It is urged, as a reafon for the rejedion of former opinions it upon this fubjed, that they tended to impofe deceptions on the c public, and to cramp conmmcrce by deftroying the negoti.,bility of cc bonds and notes. As it ftrikes me, they rather tend to Prevent, dc than to countenance, thofe frauds, and if the other con fequences will St follow, it is preferable to facrificing a majority of the public to the "9 avarice and injuftice of a few. But I cannot perceive how corn" merce, or that fort of it which is mofi ufeful to fociety, can be in" jured. That their negotiability will be refirained I admit, but they , will anfwer the purpofes for which the law intended thenli, by fa-
cilitating the colleCtion of debts, and thereby affordin,' a oneni"c ent and defirable accommodation to the people of this country."
Judge Lyon, in giving his opinion, obferved that the are.cm-nts " ufed to affimilate this to the cafe of a bill of exchange and pronlif" fory note, are totally without foundation. The reabn of the law

APPENDIX.
as applicable to tlbofe cafes, is not founded upon the principle Rtated " by the counfel for the pppellee, but upon confiderations altogether cc of a commercial nature."
Thefe obfervations certainly claim great refpe6, not only as corniug from the higheft court of judicature in Virginia, but as containing the opinions of gentlemen high in the confidence of the people of that Rate, and whofe decifions have been fo generally corredt. But Rill their weight depends upon the accuracy of the fafs on which their opinions are founded, and the corrednefs of the arguments derived from thofe fads. In this cafe of Norton and Rofe, the queftion was not upon a promiffory note, but whether an equity, originally attached to a bond, follows it into the hands of an affignee without notice. Hence what is faid refpeaing promiffory notes comes in incidentally, and was not properly before the court: The decifion as far as it refpefs the queffion before the court feems to be corred.
The obfervations in thefe cafes from Virginia, refpe&ing promiffory notes, may be reduced to three propofitions.
ift. That promiffory notes were not negotiable before the ftatute of Anne, fo as to enable the indorfee to bring an adion in his own name.
2d. That the aa of affembly, by affimilating notes to bonds, fhows mn intention in the legiflature to reflrain the negotiability of both within the fame limits.
3 d. That the negotiability given by the ac of affembly to bolids und notes was not cc intended for purpofes of commerce."
The firft of thefe propofitions is clearly incorred. It never was doubted until the cafe of Clerk v. Martin, in the firfl year of queen 4nne, that a promiffory note was a bill of exchange, even between the paee and the maker. And NO CAsE has yet decided that a promflory note) paable to order and indoifed, is not a good bill of exchange. It was never .doubted until the cafe of Buller v. Grips, in the 2d year of queen Anne, and that cafe was never decided. Judge .Carrington fays, "courts of i'quity were of courfe reforted to ;" that is, becaufe the indorfee could not bring a fuit.at law in his own name. If this was the cafe, it muft have happened betwcen MAfichaeinas term, 2 Anne, when Buller v. Crips-was argued, and 3 and 4-Anne, when the ftatute was enaded. For before the 2d ;tnne the indorfee could bring andfupport a fuit in his owp name, at law, againft the maker or iny or all of the othear

APPENDIX.
parties to the note. The cafe of Buller v. Crips only raifed a doubt, and the fQatute followed immediately and difpelled it. No cafe, it is believed, can be found of an application to equity on the grounds fuggefted by the judge.
The fecond propofition, that the ad of affembly, by affimilating notes to bonds, intended to reft~ain their negotiability within the fame limits, contains an argument which, if ufed at the trial, was not much infifled on, but which feems to be the only ground upon whiclh a doubt can be fupported. It is much to be regretted that the a6 of I705, c. 34, is not to be found, as it would probably throw fome light upon the fubjed. Its title does not, like that of its fucceffors,, mention promiffory notes. It is " An ad declaring how long jvodg-
ments, bonds, obligations and accounts fhall be in force ; for the affignment of bonds and obligations; direding what proof ihall be " fulficient in fuch cafes, and afcertaining the damage upon protefled " bills of exchange."
Whether the legiw ature of Virginia, at the time of palling this a&, had before them the ftatute of 3 and 4 Anne, c. 9, is very doubtful. It is not probable that the ads of that feffion of parliament were printed until fome time after the end of the feffion, which was on the 14 th of March 1705, on which day the ftatute of Anne. refpeaing promiffory notes received the royal iffent.
The Virginia affembly of 1705 met on the 23 d of Odober in the fame year. There does not feem to have exifted any particular motive for tranfmitting in the ?no/ expeditious manner the new ads of parliament; and if their tranimiffion was left to accident, as was probably the cafe, the prefumption is, (efpecially as it was a time of war) that the legiflature of Virginia had no knowledge of the Englifli ftatute ntil after their feffion of 1705. But however this may be, there is at prefent no evidence that prom!j/o/ry notes were made affignable by that adl of aflembly.
The at of 1730, C. 5, is entitled " An ad for afcertaining the da" mage upon protefted bills of exchange : and for the better reco" very of debts due on promifibry notes ; and for the affignment of 9 bonds, obligations and notes." As the ad of 1705 was repealed by proclamation in 1730, it is not probable that the new ac't of that year would re-enad the fame thing in fubftance. Hence a material variance may be prefumed between the two. The ad of 1730, c. 5. §" 8. is as follows : ,, And to the end the recovery of money upon pro41 miffory notes, and other writings wit~hout feal, may be rendcred"

APPENDI,.
" more eafy, be it cna&ed, &c. that if any perfon or perfons flhaflllavrd " figned or hereafter fhal! fign any note, or by any other writing, hei
fhe, or they have prornifed or obliged, or fliaplrolmife or oblige cc him, her, or themfelves to pay any fum of money, or quantity of "9 tobacco, to any other petfan or perfons, fuch perfon or perfons, to cc whom the fame is or fliall be payable, fhall and may commence and t maintain an adion of debt, and recover judgment for what flall
"apeat to be due thereupon, with cofts." And by the i ithfeR. it is enad'ed, "That it fhall and may be lawful to and for any perfori $' or perfons to affign and transfer any bond or bill for debt, or aayfch 41 note as aforefaid, to any other perfon or perfons N.]aatfoever: And 'I that the alfignee or affignecs, his and their execut6rs and admini" ftrators, by virtue of fuch affignment, fliall and may have lawful " power to commence and profecute any fuit at law in his, her, or " their own name or names, for the recovery of any debt due by " fuch bond, bill, or note, as thefirI oblijee, his executors and adnini"firators might or could lawfully do: Provided always, that in any " fuit commenced upon fuch bond, bill, or note,. fo affigned, the ( plaintiff (hall be obliged to allow all difcou'its that the defendant " can prove, either againft the plaintiff himfelf, or againft thefirt ccobligee."
The intention of this ad feems clearly to be to extend and enlarge and not to reftrit or limit the negotiability of the inftruments of which it fpeaks. Such bonds, bills and notes, as are defcribed in the ad, certainly were never negotiable or affignable at common law; and for this plain reafon, becaufe it was not the intention of the parties to make them affignable. The debtor had never confented to the making his debt negotiable ; it would therefore have been unjuft in the legiflature not to have given him the full benefit of all difcounts againft his original creditor as well as againft the affignee. The notes defcribed by the ad are thofe by which the figner hflaplrolmife or oblige himfelf to pay a fum of money, or quantity of tobacco, to any other perfon. Such a note is not negotiable in its natuire, nor by the originalcontral and intention of the parties ; the figner never gave any authority to his creditor to negotiate it, and therefore legi'flative aid was neceffary to render it negotiable. But legiflative aid was never neceffary to render negotiable a promiffory note payable to order. Let it be again repeated, that although promiffory notes had been in common ufe in England for more than half a century before the ftatute of Anne, yet there never was an adjudgedcafe iiwahich it was decided that an indorfee of fuch a note could not maintain an aCtion in his own nafne againft any of the parties to the note. But the whole ,ourfe of decifions was uniformly to the contrary. There was no

APPENDIX.
tieceffity therefore for the Virginia aflembly to pfovide for the negotiability of notes payable to order; and hence we find that they confine the ad to bonds, bills, andfuch notes as, at common law, flood upon, the fame ground as bonds; and were confidered as mere chofes in, a&ion, unaffignable in their nature, and only fimple evidence of a debt due by one man to another. Although it muff be prefumed thac the legiflature of Virginia in 1730 had full knowledge of the flatut of Anne, yet it is equally to be prefimed that they knew that it was made in affirmance of the law as it before exifted, and folely to remove the doubts which had been fuggefted by lord Holt. It muff alfi be prefumed that they knew what had been the unilorm prae-lice, and courfe of adjudications ever fAnce the firfitntrodudion of promiffory notes. The evidence which weJfill have of thefe fads is tfrong and clear ; but it muff have been more ftrong and clear in the year i 73o, when many perfons were living who probably had perfonal know ledgt of the whole hiftory of the flatute of Anne. Hence then it may be fairly concluded that the affembly intended to leave thofe inftruments which in their own nature, and by the confent of the parties, were negotiable, as well as thofe which were negotiable under the cuftom of merchants, to the proteftion of fuch principles of law as had been. already found fufficient to fupport them.
The aft of 1748, C. 27, has precifely the fame title as the ad of 173 o , and precifely the fame provifion as to the affignment of bonds, bills and notes, making ufe of exatly the fame expreffidns, excepting that the words, " before nbtice of fuch qlignment was given to the c defendant," are added immediately after the word " obligee," irx tle laft line of the patFage before cited. So that this ad of 1748 gave the aflignee of juch bonds, bills and notes the fame remedy at law, which he had before in equity; and this feems to have been the only ufe and intent of the ad.
The ad of 1786, c. 29, §"3 and 4, is in tefe words, "An ac9 tion of debt may be maintained upon a note or writing, by wbich, " the perfon figning the fame flaall promife or oblige himfelf to pay c a fum of money or quantity of tobacco to anothee. Affignments of
c bonds, bills and promiflbry notes, and other writings 'obligatory, " for payment of money or tobacco fhall be valid ; and an aftignee of 49 any fuch, may thereupon maintain an ation of debt, in his owix " name, but thall allow all juft difcounts, not only againft himfelf, - but againift the affignor, before notice of the affignment was given "9 to the defendant." This ad, although its language is more concife, does not, as it refpeds the preferit queftion, differ in fubffance from t'e aCd of 1730- It is evident that it refe- to the fame kind.

of notes. If notes payable to order were negotiable before- the paffing of thefe ads, it is clear that there, is nothing contained in either of them to reftrid that negotiability. This brings us back to the enquiry, what was the law refpefing fuch notes previous to the flatute of Anne. If an indorfed promiflory note payable to order was in its nature an inland bill of exchange, and if in pradice it was: always fo confidered, there is nothing in the ads of affembly of Virgi" nia that f.orbids its being fill confidered as fuch. How and when did the law firft obtaiin in Virginia refpeding inland bills of exchange ? Nothing is faid of them in the flatute law of Virginia until the a& of 1786, c. 29, which adopts the provifions and nearly the words of the Englifhjflatute of 9, and 1o W. 3, c. 17, and 3 and 4. Anne, c. 9. Their negotiability is taken for granted, and muft have been derived from the cuitoni of merchants. But the fame cuftom which gave negotiability to inland bills of exchange, gave equal negotiability to indorfed promiffory notes payable to order. It made no diflindlion between them. W at the pradice has been in Virginia feems doubtful. Lawyers differ in their accounts of it; and it can not be confidered as fettled.
The cafe of Lee and Love, i Calf. 499, was by the indorfee againfi. the indorfer of a promiflbry note payable to order. The count refied upon was money had and received. But the court held that the
laintiff was not entitled to recover againft the defendant, becaufe e had not firft brought fuit againif the maker of the note. It is to be regretted that the court did not give their reafons for fuppofing fuch a fuit neceffary. It was. faid that they confidered the cafe as having been already decided ; and they probably alluded to the cafe of Mackie v. Davis, as that is the only cafe cited by the counfel for the defendartit. But this point was not decided in that cafe. Judge Carrington faid, ccAs to the lengths which it behoves the affignee to go in pur" fuit of the obligor, before he can refort to the affignor, it is unnecef"fary to lay down any general rule.: it may fuffice to fay that in the , prefent cafe he went far enough." Judge Roane faid, ( In this 4( country, the affignee of a bond acquires a legal right to bring fiut upcc on it, and to-receive the money, difcharged from any controul of the 4c affignor over the fubjea; it is terefrre his duty to bring fuit." The
duty of bringing a fuit, does not, at the firft glance, feem to be the inevitable confequence of a right to fue ; and it is. regretted that, the intermediate terms were not hinted, which. conned the conclufion with the premifes. But the dictum of a fingle judge, however refpeaable, upon a point not neceflliry to fupport the judgment, can not be confidered as conclufively fettling the law. The only points
decided in.that cafe were, that a affignee of a bond might, maintaia

APPENDIX.
,an affion for money had and received againft the affignor; and that tthe aflignee had done enough to entitle himfelf to fuch adion, by bringing fuit againft the obligor, profecuting it to judgment, and taking out afierifaciaswhich was returned nulla bona.
Thefe feem to be all the reported cafes in Virginia which bear upen the prefent queftion.
In Pennfylvania a number of cafes have occurred, from the whole of which it appears doubtftd whether the ftatute of Anne is to be confidered as havig been extended in pradice to that ftate, or whether their adions upon promiflry notes are grounded upon the cuftorn of nierchants. Their a& of affembly of 28th May, 171 , feems %tohave been pafled in the full contemplation of the ftatute of Anne, but it provides a right of ation only for the indorfee againft the maker, and that only to recover fo much " asihall appear to be due at the time 44 of the alignment, in like manner" as the payee .night have done. But it ,gives no aclion to the payee againft the maker, nor to the indorfee againft any of the indorfers. Yet fuch aStions are maintained in that ·tfate upon promiffory notes confidered as injlruments. Judge Shippen, in the cafe of Robertfon v. Vloge, x Dall. 252, fays, " there can be . no doubt that the right of indorfees to call upon the indorfers mu "-be founded on the cr/9m of merchants." It appears by their a& of affembly that a right of aCtion already exifted by the payee ;gainft the maker ; and judge Shippen fuppofes it to be under the ftatute of Anne, which he imagines had been extended in pratice to that flate. But this could hardly have happened prior to the year 1715, (the date of their adft of aflimbly,) which was only ten years after the ftatute of Anne. He obferves alfo, that " the legiflatre, when regulating ,9 the affignment of bonds and notes, though they did not exprefsly - put them on the fame footing with bills of exchange, muft, from 9( the terms of the ad, have taken it for granted that an a~tion might " be brought upon a promiffory note confidered as an inftrument. £ Till therefore a contrary opinion is pronounced, 'we nuJi proceed aF
in the cafe of a bill of exchange under the ftatute of Anne," &c.
But in the fubfequent cafe of M'Culloch v. Hotufon, in the fupreme
court of Pennfylvania, Dall. 44!, chief juftice M'Kean was of opi-
nion that the legiflature intended to put promiffory notes on the fame -footing as bonds, at leaft fo far as to admit the equity of a note to follow it into the hands of the indorfee. He fays, " before this ad it
appears that actions by the payee of a promiffory note were not maintained, nor can they fince be maintained, otherwife tban by extending the Englifl fttute of Anne." And to account tor this

APPENDIX.
extenfion of the ilatute he fuppofes " that ations upon promiffory "notes were brought here foon after the paffing of the itatute, by "attornies who came from England, and were accuftomed to the "forms of prafice in that kingdoip, but did not perhaps nicely at-
tend to the difcrimination with regard to the extenfion, or adoption, Of lfatutes." But this could not have happened in the courfc of ten years fo as to have eflablifhed a pradice ; for we are firft to fuppofe a praffice in England under the ftatute, a fubfequent removal of attornies from England to Pennfylvania, and then a praaice in Pennfylvania to be eftablifhed, and all this between the paflling of the 11atute of Anne in the year I7o5 and the a& of affembly in 1715. A more probable conjefture feems to be, that the firft fettlers who came over from England about the year 1683, were well acquainted with the ufe of promiffory notes and the laws refpeding them, as they had ben pradifed upon in that country for at leaft thirty years. The hrft emigrations to Pennfylvania were about the time when the banking bufinefs of the goldfmiths was at its greatefi height, and it was fifteen or twenty years after the firft fettlement of Pennfylvania, before a doubt was fuggelled whether an adion would lay on a promiffory note as an initrument. Hence it is probable that adions on fuch notes were brought in the fame manner as they had been ufed in England, to wit, on the cuftom of merchants ; and upon that ground, and not urpon the ftatute of Anne, probably refis the prefent pradice in Penn:fylvania.
The pradice in New H~mpfbi#e and Maffachufetts feelns to have ·the fame foundation. They declare upon promiffory notes as injiruinents, and rely upon the exprefspromnife in 'writing, without alleging a confideration or referring to any flatute or cuftom whereby the defeniant is rendered liable 'without a confideration. In Connedicut it is faid by Swift in hiskfletn of the la'ws, that the indorfee muff fue in the name of the payee ; but the payee can maintain an adtion upon the note without alleging any cuftom, or ftatute, or confideration. In New York they have nearly copied the ftatute of Anne as far as it relates to. promiffory notes, but how the law was confidered before -their ad of Affembly of 1788, we are not informed. In Maryland the flatute of Anne was confidered as in force and always prafifed -upon. Their declarations have been precifely in the Englifh form, al. leging the defendant to be liable by force of thefiatute, and the courts have flridlr adhered to the adjudications in England. Hence nothing conclufive can be inferred from the praCtice of the ftates.
The third propofition drawn from .the reported cafes in Virginia is, hat the negotiability given to bonds and notes by the a& of affembly

APPENDIX.
,d that *iate, 'zvasnot intendedfor purpjes of commerce. It feems difficult to affign a reafon why the legiflature fhould have made bonds and notes affignable, unlefs it was to enable people to transfer that kind of property which exifted irn fuch bondls and notes ; and tht transfer of property is the only means of commerce. It will not be contended that the fole obje& of the legiflature was to enable the holders of fuch paper to give it-away in voluntary donations. It muft therefore have been intended to enable them either to pafs it away in payment of debts previoufly contra&ed in the way of commerce, or to make it in itfelf an article of merchandize. ' If, therefore, for the pi irpofes of commerce, the legifature intended to make thofe contra&s negotiable, which were not fo either in their nature or by the confent of the parties, it is fair to prefume that they did not mean to impede the negotiability of fuch as were in their own nature negotiable, and were txprefsly intended to be made fo by the will of the contrnding parties. If there wer¢ anj principles of law which would fupport the negotiability of a promiffory note payable to order, it can not be fuppofed that the legiflature intended by implication alone, to obftrued their operation. And even admitting that they did not, by the at making bonds and notes affignable, mean to aid commerce, yet it can not be prefumed that they intended to wage .war with thofe commercial principles which were .already eftablifled.
This brings us back again to the firft enquiry, what were the prin·ciples upon which ihe negotihbility of promiffory notes was fupportea, ,before the ftatute of Anne. If'fuch prihciples did exift, there feems to be nothing in this a& of affembly which prevents their full operatiorf in Virginia.
The conclufion from the whole is, that there is no principle derived either from the common law, or from the adft of aflimbly of Virginia, which will prevent a court of law from carrying into effe& the contra6l of the parties according to their original intention.
Even admitting that the contrat of the defendant is not negotiable at law fo as to enable the plaintiff to declare upon the inftrument itfelf, yet it can not be denied that itis affignable in equity, and if fo, the plaintiff becomes in equity entitled to the money which the defendant received from the intermediate indorfer ; and in fuch a cafe, there never has been a doubt fince the ,time of lord Mansfield, that the plaintiff is entitled to recover in an ation for money had and received.

NOTE (B.)
THIS cafe was much debated in the court below. It appearea from the books that the' only reported cafe in which it had been de,cided that an action of debt would not lie upon a promiffory note., was that of We//h v. Creagh, ii Geo. *1, 8 Mod. 373, 1 Str.. 68o, which is fo inaccurately reported that it is impoffible to fay between what parties to the note the a&ion was. In 8 Mod. " it was faid that 4, it would not lie againf the indorfer, but that it would lie againft the cc drvwer." But we colledt from the report, that the reafon of the decifion was, that before the ftatute of Anne, no adion at all wouldi lie upon the note, as a note ; (for which the cafe of Clerk v. Martin, i Salk. 129, was cited). That the ftatute gave only the fame kind of a~dion as upon inland bills, and that an a6ion of debt was never known to be ,brought upon a bill of exchange. And probably the court in that cafe relied on Hard.485, to fupport this pofition.
Another reafon given is, that the Ratute 4aclares "that the a1 //gnee 94 or indorfee may maintain an acaion againft the drawer or indorfer, " and recover da;,viaes, &c. which fhews that an a6tion of debt will ' not lie, becaufc damages are never recovered in debt."
The firft pofition, viz. that no aion, before the flatute, would lay upon a note, as a note, feems not to be correa, 2Athough fupported by the cafe of Clerk and Martin, for that cafe was direffly contrary to the whole current of authorities prior to that time, particularly to the cafe of Williams v. Williams, 5 WV. and M. Carth. 269,; and the ftatute of Anne fecns to have been made, not to alter the law, but to over-rule this cafe of Clerk v. Maiartin, and to place promiffory notes on the fame footing on which they flood prior to that decifion. (See the preceding note.)
It is true that in Milton's cafe, Hard.485, it was decided that art afion of debt would not lie againft the acceptor of a bill of exchange; but the reafon given fhows that it would lie againft the maker of a promiffory note. For it was faid that the undertaking of the acceptor was only collaterol, to pay the debt of another, and that the drawer continued debtor, notwithfanding the acceptance. So that the reafon feems to be that the ac,-ptor was not the briginal debtor. But the maker of a promiflory note is the original debtor, and therefore an action of debt would lie againfi him, by the fame rule that it would not lie agairifi the acceptor of a bill.

In Baker v. Hill, 3 Kcb. 627, the adtion was dbt on an inland bill, but it is -not ftated between what parties. There was a demurrer to the plea, and judgment for the plaitiff. This was eight years after the cafe in Hardres. And in the caf6 of Brown v. London, 2 Keb. 695,, 713, 758, 822. 1 Vent 152. 1 Lev. 298, and i Mod. 285, it feems to be admitted that an adion of indebitatus aJfumpJit for riioney had and received would lie, if the acceptor had the money in his hands to pay.
In early times "all matters of perfonal contrail were confidered as cc binding only in the light of debts ; and the only means of recovery "c was by this action of debt." i Reeve, 159. It was not without repeated itruggles that the aaion on.the cafe was permitted to be brought for breach of a perfonal contra-. Even as late as the reign of Queen Elizabeth it was confidered as a matter of great doubt whether affu mpfit would lie in any cafe where an adfion of debt might be brought. The court of King's bench held that it would; and the commonplear held that it would not ; but it was finally determined after great debate before all the judges of England in the exchequer chamber, in Slades cafe, 4 Co. 93, that afumpfit would lie for the price of corn fold,
The cafe o Core v. Woddye, 28 H. 8, Dyer 20, is a ftrong cafe to fhow that where the defendant has received money to which the plaintiff is entitled, he may have an acdion of debt for it.
A promiffory note has always been held to be good evidence of monry received by the maker of the note to the ufe of the payee. in that cafe the court, in giving their opiuion, faid, "Admit that there " was not tny bill tejlfying the receipt, yet by the common opinion of c the books, it is in the eledion of the bailor to have an adion of. c debt, or account, in fuch a cafe." And in the cafe of MJkeredith v. Chvte, 2 Ld. Raym. 760, it was faid by the whole court, that a note was good evidence of a debt due from the maker to the payee.
In Godbolt 49, the adion is faid to be i debt upon a concf/,it folvre., "4 according to the law merchant." ' This feems to have been fome kind of an acknowledgment of a debt, in the nature of a proniffory note.
In Domingo Franca's cafe, x iMod. 345, it was held that debt or indebitatus aJfupfit *mightbe brought upon a bill of exchange by the payee againfi the drawer, c, becaufe it is in the nature of a fecurity.
The adion of debt was the ordinary remedy upon a Tally, which feems to have been no better evidence ef a debt than a promiflbry. note:

APPENDIM.
A Tally is thuS defined by Spebnan in his Gl/orryp. 532, Edit. 1631?, c Talliurq, alias Talea, eft clavola vel ligni portiuncula, utrinqu% complanata, cuifuinma debiti inciditur; fiffaque inde in duas partes, una debitori, altera creditori traditur, in rationis memoriarn-"
Thefe tallies feem to have been a kind of common fecurity for money, and to have been negotiable like bank bills, paffing from hand to hand by delivery only. 12 Mod.241. Afions of debt upon them are mentioned in Fitz. ab. Tit. Dtt. 4. 4. E. 2. Fitz. ab. Ley. 68, 70, . M B'. 122, L Dyer 23, Hard. 333, and 2 Keb. 713. Sometim~s they were fealed, but in general they were without a feal an4 were only evidence of a fimple contract. Againft a common tally, thd defendant might wage his law4 and in Dyer 23, it appears, that " there is one book which fays that a man may wage his law againit c a fealid tally, if the tally have only notches orfcotches indented, each dfrotche for twelve pence, according to the common ufage but if c thef"u be infc:ribed upon the fealed tally, he fhall be oulted of his ", law."
The cafe of Rumball v. Ball, 10 Afod. 38, was debt upon a promiffory note ; and although an objedion was taken to the want of a demand, yet none was made to the form of the akion.
In Rudder v. Price, i H. Bi. 547, the action was debt upon a promiffory note, payable by inltahnents ; and although the cafe wat warmly contefted,, and although Mr.fiifice LiWrzence who was then at the bar, was for the defendant, yet no obje6ion was fuggefted to, the form of the afion ; but it was contended, aqd fo held by the court, that aq! adion of debt would nct lie £ipou facli a note until all the inftalments had become due.
Morgan in his precedents,,p. 584, has given the form of a declaration in debt on .dpromiffory note, and Kyd in his treatife on bills and hotes p. 114, (Dublin Edit. 1791 ) after noticing fome of the authorities on this fubjefl, fays, " the conclufion refulting from the whole cc feems to be this, that where a privity exifts between the parties, "there an a&ion of debt or indebitatus afanp it may be maintained."
Comyns, (Dig. Tit. Debt. (A. 8.) lays down the propofition genelly, gthat debt lies upon every exprefs contrail to pay a fum certain," and cites i Leo. 2o8.

Young, 2 Bos. and Pul. 78, where it was held that " an adion of i debt lies by the payee againft the maker of a promiffory note ex-, "preffed to be]or value received.",
The declaration in that cafe was, " for that the defendant, on .t at made his certain note in writing commonly called a " pro"9miffory note, with his own proper hand thereto fubfcribed bearing "c date the fame day and year aforefaid, and then and there delivered " the faid note to the plaintiff, by which note the faid defendant, cne It month after date promifed to pay to the plaintiff or order ,. 8. value " received in goods by the defendant, by reafon whereof and by force "c of the flatute in that cafe made and provided, the defendant beU came liable to pay to the plaintiff the faid furn of .money in the faid "ic note mentioned, 'whereby an ailion bath accrued," &c. To this de-
claration there was a general demurrer, in fupport of which the counfel'relied chiefly on the cafe of Wey/, and Craig, 8 AMod. 373. 1 AStr68o.
Lord Chief Yufliee Eldon, in delivering the opinion'of the court, ex-
amined the cafes cited and the principles on which the affion of debt is founded. He held that the ftatute of Anne had put promiffory notes on the fame footing, and given upon them the fame remedy, as 'was before had upon inland bill; of exchange. That an' adion of debt would lie up6n an inland bill of exchange, by the payee againiit the drawer, whom he confidered as the original debtor, and there-. fore debt would lie by the payee of a promifforv note againft the. maker who is the original debtor. He relied alfo on the words value received; and cited Hard.485.- Skin. 39$, Pearfon v. Garrett. Cor. Dig. Debt. B. Debt. A. 8. and 9. Salk. 23. Hard's cafe. Skin. 34mHodges v. Steward. to Mod. 32. Rumball v. Ball.
The objeeion that the flatute of limitations was not permitted to be given in evidence upon the plea of nil debet, is fupported only by a diaum of chiefjulice Holt, in Salk. 278. 4non. at nifiprius, Anne
169g , and in the cafe of Draperv. Gla//op, i Lord Ray. 153, 8 and 9 W. 3. The reafon which he gives in the firft cafe, is, " For the/flac tute has made it no debt at the time of the plea pleaded; the words of "9 which are in the prefent tenfe. But in cafe on non afetnpfit the ftia 4 tute of limitations cannot be given in evidence, for it fpeaks of a it time part, and relates to the time of making the promife." Tbe reafon given. in the cafe of Draper and Glaffop, is, " becaufe non afunimp "fit goes to the prpder teyf ;, but upon nil debet pleaded the fltatute is ".good evidence, becaufe the iflue is joined ter verba de priel'iti, ant

APPENDIX.
4c without doubt nil debet by virtue of the ftatute ; and it is no debt , at this time, though it was a debt."
In i Morgan's V. Mecum, 220, this cafe is cited with a ".ed quere*, and he advife that the ftatute fhould be pleaded.
The expreffion of theflatute of ar. x. c. 1-6, which is the fame as that of the ait of affembly of Maryland, 1715, c. 23, is, that the aion thall be brought within fuch a time, and not after. It does not extinguifh the debt, but only bars the remedy at law. The hlpfe of time is, not of itfelf evidence that the defendant does not owe the money. The flatute only creates a difqualification of the plaintiff to recover, like that of out-lawry, alien enemy, feme covert, &c. or it may be confidered as a fpecial protecftion of the defendant, like a certificate of bankruptcy, infancy, or a difcharge under an infolvent at.
That the debt is not extinguilhed by the ftatute is clear from the cafes which have been decided fince the time of lord Holt.
In the cafe of 9uantock v. England, 4 Bur. 2628, it was held that A debt barred by the Ratute is a good debt to fupport a commiffion of bankruptcy. The fame was exprefsly decided by lord Mansfield at n!f prius in the cafe of Fowier v. Brown, cited in Efp. N. P. 563. And in Trueman v. Fenton, Cowbp. 548, his lordfhip faid, " all the " debts of a bankrupt are due in confcience, notwithftanding, he cc has obtained his certificate. Tbough all legal remedy may be gone, " the debts are clearly not extinguf/hed in confiience. Where a man de, 4 vifes his eftate for payment of his debts, a court of equity fays, " (and a court of law, in a cafe properly before them, would fay the ,, fame) all debts barred by the ftatute of limitations fhall come in, "'and fhare the benefit of the devife."
Hence it appears that the teafon which lord Holt gives for the diftinCtion between non afmpft, and nil debet, is not fupported. And if the reafon fails the law fails with it.
The objeffions refpeffing the letters of adminiftration, and the omiffion of the debet and detinet were fuppofed to come too late after verdid.
