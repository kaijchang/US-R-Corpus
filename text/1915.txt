EATON v. BOSTON TRUST CO. Opinion of the Court.

EATON, TRUSTEE IN BANKRUPTCY OF LUKE, v. BOSTON SAFE DEPOSIT AND TRUST COMPANY, TRUSTEE OF LEIGHTON.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF
MASSACHUSETTS.
No. 466. Motion to dismiss or affirm submitted February 28, 1916.Decided March 13, 1916.
Trusts for life with income to be free from interference or control of creditors of the beneficiary are in Massachusetts valid and effective against creditors, and under certain conditions, against assignees in insolvency and trustees in bankruptcy.
The policy of the-Bankruptcy Act is to respect state exemptions. A trust fund established by a will, the whole of the income to be paid
during life of the beneficiary with such portion of the principal as shall make the annual amount to be paid at least a stated sum, said income to be free from interference or control of creditors, held, in this case, following the decision of the highest court of Massachusetts, not to pass to the trustee in bankruptcy of the beneficiary under § 70 a (5) of the Bankruptcy Act.
THE facts, which involve the construction and application of § 70 a (5) of the,Bankruptcy Act, and of the rights of the life tenant in a trust fund created under the laws of Massachusetts, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Raymond H. Oveson, Mr. Alexander Kendall and Mr. Matthew Hale for defendant in error in support of the
motion.
Mr. Gi'bert E. Kemp for plaintiff in error in opposition thereto.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.
This is a bill for instructions, brought by the Trust Company, the principal defendant in error, to ascertain whether a fund bequeathed to it in trust for Mrs. Luke,

codefendant in error, passed to her trustee in bankruptcy. The bequest was of sevlenty-fi e thousand dollars, "The whole of the net income thereof to be paid my adopted daughter, Fannie Leighton Luke, wife of Otis H. Luke, of said Brookline during her life quarterly in each Ind every year together with such portion of the principal of said trust fund as shall make the amount to be paid her at least Three Thousand Dollars a year during her life, said income to be free from. the interference or control of her
creditors." It is established law in Massachusetts that such trusts are valid' and effective against creditors, Broadway National Bank v. Adams, 133 Massachusetts, 1170, and, subject to what we are about to say, against
assignees in insolvency or trustees in bankruptcy. Billings v. Marsh, 153 Massachusetts, 3.11. Munroe v. Dewey, 176 Massachusetts, 184. The trustee in bankruptcy seeks to avoid the effect of these decisions on the ground that Mrs. Luke's equitable life interest was held by the Supreme Court of the State to be assigpable, and that therefore it passed under § 70a (5) of the Bankruptcy Act, vesting in the trustee all property that the bankrupt "could by any means have transferred." The Supreme Judicial Court, however, held that the above cited cases governed and that the property did not pass. 220 Massachusetts, 484.
If it be true without qualification that the bankrupt could have assigned her interest and by so doing could have freed from the trust both the fund and any proceeds received by her, the argument would be very strong that the sthtute intended the fund to pass. There would be an analogy at least with the provision giving the trustee all powers that the bankrupt might have exercised for her own benefit, § 70 a (3), and there would be difficulty in admitting that a person could have property over which he could exercise all the powers of ownership except to make it liable for his debts. The' conclusion that the

EATON v. BOSTON TRUST CO.

240 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

fund was assignable was based on two cases, and we presume was meant to go no farther than their authority required. The first of these simply held that an executor was not liable on his bond for paying over an annuity to an assignee as it fell, due, w1'en the assignor to whom it was bequeathed free from creditors had not attempted to avoid his act. Ames- v. Clarke, 106 Massachusetts, 573. The other cage does not go beyond a dictum that carries theprinciple no farther. Huntress v. Allen, 195 Massachusetts, 226. It is true that where the restriction has' been enforced there generally has been a clause against anticipation, but the present decision in following them holds the restricting clause paramount, and therefore we feel warranted in assuming that the power of alienation will not be pressed to a point inconsistent with the dominant intent of the will. Whether if that power were absolute the restriction still should be upheld as in case of a statutory exemption that leaves the bankrupt free to convey his rights it is unnecessary to decide.
The law of Massachusetts treats such restrictions as limiting the character of the equitable property and inherent in it. Dunn v. Dobson, 198 Massachusetts, 142, 146. Lathrop V. Merrill, 207 Massachusetts, 6, 9. Whatever may have been the criticisms upon the policy and soundness of the doctrine, and whatever may be, the power of this court to weigh the reasoning upon which it has been established by the Massachusetts cases, Page v. Edmisnds, 187 U. S. 596, 602, it has been established too long and is too nearly sanctioned by the decisions of this court to be overthrown here. Nichols v. Eaton, 91 U. S. 716. Shelton v. King, 229'U. S. 90, 99. The policy of the Bankruptcy Act is to respect state exemptions, and until the Massachusetts decisions shall have gone farther than they yet have we are not prepared to say that the present
bequest is not protected by the Massachusetts rule. Decree affirmed.

the interest claimed by either complainant is sufficient in value to confer jurisdiction, and hence the bill was properly dismissed.. It is obvious that, in the view we take of the case, the question of collusive joinder becomes immaterial.

UTERHART, TRUSTEE OF STEIN, v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No. 214, Argued January 24, 1916.-Decided April 3, 1916.
The right to succeed to property of a decedent depends upon, and is regulated by, state law. Knowlton v. Moore, 178 U. S. 41.
The judicial construction of a will by a state court of competent jurisdiction determines not only legally but practically the extent and character of the interests taken by the legatees.
The court of the State in which the decedent's will was probated and having jurisdiction to construe the same, having decided that, as to the residuary estate, the will involved in this caqe constituted a trust continuing until after July 1, 1902, and that no beneficiary was entitled to receive anything except on affirmative exercise of discretion conferred upon the executors and trustees, held that the interests of the residuary legatees were contingent and not vested prior to July 1, 1902, within the meaning of the Refunding Act of June 27, 1902, except as to such amounts as were actually paid to the legatees prior to that date by the trustees in the exercise of their discretion.

Mr. H. T. Newcomb, with whom Mr. Morris F. Frey was on the brief, for appellant:

Argument for the United States.

240 U. S.

The burden of proof to establish that the interests of the legatees were "not absolutely vested in possession" prior to July 1, 1902, rests'upon appellants.
Construction of Jones and Pratt decisions. They either mean that the interest of legatees is vested in possession
when, (a) the right of creditors has been barred; or (b) when a final administration of the estate has been effected.
On this record, it must be assumed that everything had been done under New York laws to bar creditors and vest right of legatees.
It must likewise be assumed that final administration of the estate had been effected under the New York laws.
The interests of the various legatees, under paragraph 8 of the will, in the entire residuary estate, irrespective of any question of administration, had "absolutely vested in possession" prior to July 1, 1902.
The will must be read in connection with the New York
decree. The burden of proof is upon the appellants on this
point also. On any proper construction of New York decree, the
interests of the legatees were absolutely vested at the common law.
The same result must follow under the act of June 27, 1902; for the reasons given in United States v. Fidelity Trust Co., 222 U. S. 158.
In support of these contentions, see also Burrillv. Sheil, 2 Barb. 451; Cropley v. Cooper, 19 Wall. 167; Goebel v. Wolf, 113 N. Y. 405; Hanson v. Graham, 6 Vesey, 239;

MR. JUSTICE PITNEY delivered the opinion of the court.

This was a suit to recover succession taxes paid by appellants under the act of June 13, 1898 (ch. 448; 30 Stat. 448, 464), on account of interests in personal property passing to the residuary' legatees under the will of Conrad Stein, deceased. It was brought under the act of June 27, 1902 (ch. 1160, § 3; 32 Stat. 406), which provides for refunding "so much of said tax as may have been collected on contingent beneficial interests which shall not have become vested prior to July first, nineteen hundred and two." The testator was domiciled in the State of New York, and the will was probated and appellants were appointed executors and trustees in that jurisdiction. The residuary legatees were seven of the nine children of testator; and at the time of his death on April 6, 1900, sevieral of them were minors. All of the seven were living on July 1, 1902. The youngest, Carl Stein, had not attained the age of twenty-one years on that date. The residuary estate amounted to more than $1,000,000, and the taxes collected with respect to it aggregated $17,130.82, being based upon the theory that each of these legatees took a vested seventh interest at the death of the testator. If the taxes had been assessed on the advances actually made by appellants as executors and trustees for the benefit of the residuary legatees, prior to July 1, 1902, they would have amounted to only $745.12.
One of the clauses of the will contained words bequeathing the residuary estate outright to the seven children in equal shares; but this was qualified by inconsistent language in other clauses, and some time prior to January 16,

240 U. S.

1902, one of the executors brought suit in the Supreme Court of the State of New York against his co-executors and the beneficiaries for a judicial construction of the will, and a decree was made on the date mentioned, of which the pertinent clauses are set forth in the margin.1
"It is further ordered, adjudged and decreed: That it was. the in-
tention of the said Conrad Stein, and such is the true meaning and construction of his will, that the whole of his residuary estate, real and personal, should, so far as necessary, be applied to the support and education of -his minor children, Josephine Stein, Paula Stein, Ella Stein and Carl Stein during the minorities if Carl Stein survive such period. To that end he gave, devised and bequeathed to Emil Heuel and Alexander Stein his executors and trustees, and to Josephine Stein, his executrix and trustee, all his residuary estate both real and personal, upon trust to receive the rents, issues and profits and income thereof until his son Carl Stein attains the age of twenty-one years, and to apply the same tG the support and education of the testator's said minor children, Josephine Stein, Paula Stein, Ella Stein and Carl Stein, until they respectively -attain the age of twenty-one years, if Carl Stein survive such period, and .on Carl Stein attaining the age of twenty-one years, or sooner dying, the said testator gave, devised and bequeathed the said residuary estate, both real and personal, to his children Charlotte Truebenbach, Wilhelmina Schneider, Elizabeth Heuel, Josephine Stein, Paula Stein, Ella Stein and Carl Stein in equal
shares and parts. "The-said executors and executrix and trustees are empowered by
the said will to let and lease the said residuary real estate and to make such repairs and improvements upon said residuary real estate as in their judgment may be necessary. After the payment of taxes and other expenses of the administration of the estate, they are to apply so much of the rents of the real estate, and of the income of the personal estate as shall be reasonable and proper, to the support and education of the testator's said minor children during their respective minorities as aforesaid. The rents of the real. estate are to be applied first to the uses aforesaid, and aftei making such application the said executors and executrix and trustees are, from time to time, whenever they shall judge proper, to divide any surplus rents among the testator's said children, Charlotte Truebenbach, Wilhelmina Schneider, Elizabeth Heuel, Josephine Stein, Paula Stein, Ella Stein and Carl Stein in equal proportions, the shares of any minor child to be paid to the guardian of-that child's estate.

UTERHART v. UNITED STATES.

240 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Testator's personalty passed under the will, and the executors and trustees proceeded under and complied strictly with the directions contained in it, as interpreted and construed by the decree.
The Court of Claims held (49 Ct. Cls. 709) that the interest bequeathed by the will to the residuary legatees was a vested estate, and not a contingent beneficial interest. Citing Vanderbilt v. Eidman, 196 U. S. 480, and United States v. Fidelity Trust Co., 222 U. S. 158.
It is very properly admitted by the Government that the New York decree is in this proceeding binding with respect to the meaning and effect of the will. The right to succeed to the property of the decedent depends upon and is regulated by state law (Knowlton v. Moore, 178 U. S. 41, 57), and itis obvious that a judicial construction of the will by a state court of competent jurisdiction determines not only legally but practically the extent and character of the interests taken by the legatees.
It is, however, contended that the will, as thus construed, either gave the residuary estate absolutdly to the children by name, share and share alike, postponing pay-
"The said executors and executrix and trustees are further empowered from time to time during the minority of the said minor children to pay over by way of advance to the said Charlot4e, Wilhelmina, Elizabeth, Josephine, Paula, Ella and Carl, in equal amounts or shares, so much of the capital of the testator's residuary personal estate, or the income thereof as in their judgment they may deem reasonable so to pay over, the shares going to any minor children to be paid to the guardian of that child's estate.
"It is Further Ordered, Adjudged and Decreed: That the said executors and executrix are authorized and empowered, after Carl Stein shall have attained the age of twenty-one years, to sell and convey from time to time all or any part of the testator's residuary real estate.
"And it is Further Adjudged and Decreed: That the said executors and executrix and trustees shall not be compelled to make distribution of the principal of the estate or any part thereof, except in the exercise of their reasonable discretion, until the said Carl Stein attains the age of twenty-one years."

ment merely until Carl died or,reached majority, or that it gave the estate to them absolutely when Carl died or attained majority, meanwhile giving to each child the income of his or her proportionate share. With this view we cannot concur. The decree declares the true construction to be "that the whole of his residuary estate, real and personal, should, so far as necessary, be applied to the support and education of his minor children, Josephine Stein, Paula Stein, Ella Stein and Carl Stein during the minorities 'if Carl Stein survive such period." Then follows a clause to the effect that the trustees should apply the income to the support and education of the minor children until they respectively attained the age of twenty-one years, if Carl survived such period, and that on his attaining the age of twenty-one or sooner dying the testator gave, devised, and bequeathed the residue to the seven named (including Carl) in equal shares. A subsequent clause directs the executors and trustees "to apply so much of the rents of the real estate, and of the income of the personal estate as, shall be reasonable and proper, to the support and education of the testator's said minor children during their respective minorities as aforesaid." They are empowered, during the minority of the minor children, "to pay over by way of advance" to the seven, "in equal amounts or shares, so much of the capital of the testator's residuary personal estate, or the income thereof asin their judgment they may.deem r asanableso to pay over." And, finally, "the said executors and executrix and trustees shall not be compelled to make distribution of the principal of the estate or any part thereof, except in the exercise of their. reasonable discretion, until the said Carl Stein attains the age of twenty-one years."
It will be observed not only that the trust continued until the youngest child reached the age of twenty-one, but that no one of the seven was entitled in the meantime to receive anything of either principal. or income except

on the affirmative exercise of a discretion conferred upon the executors and trustees.
This having been authoritatively decided to be the true effect and meaning of the will, we are of opinion that the interests to which the residuary legatees succeeded were contingent, and not vested prior to July 1, 1902, within the meaning of the refunding act as construed in previous decisions of this court upon the subject (Vanderbilt v. Eidman, 196 U. S. 480, 500; United States v. Jones, 236 U. S. 106, 111; McCoach v. Pratt, 236 U. S. 562), except with respect to such amounts as were actually paid out of the trust fund by the trustees prior to that date, in the exercise of their discretion; the proper tax upon which, according to the findings, would have been $745.12.
The judgment will be reversed, and the cause remanded with direction to enter judgment in favor of appellants for the tax collected in excess of that amount upon the interests of the residuary legatees.

Under the acts of May 8, 1906 and June 25, 1910, the Secretary of the Interior has exclusive authority and jurisdiction to determine the heirs of an allottee Indian who are entitled to succeed to the allotment made to him under the act of February 8, 1887, in case of his death during the restricted period; and this authority includes the right to reopen and review a previous administrative order on proper charges of newly discovered evidence or fraud while the property is still under administrative control.
A court has no power to issue a writ of mandamus to control the conduct of the Secretary of the Interior concerning a matter within his administrative authority.

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

241 U. S.

THE facts, which involve the construction of the act of February 8, 1887, and the jurisdiction of the courts to control by mandamus the action of the Secretary of the Interior concerning an allotment thereunder, axe stated in the opinion.

The Solicitor General,with whom Mr. Robert Szold was on the brief, for plaintiff in error:
Since the United States, the real party defendant, has not consented to be sued in this cause, it should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.
The United States is the real party defendant. Naganab v. Hitchcock, 202 U. S. 473; Oregon v. Hitchcock, 202 U. S.60.
The immunity of the United States from suit is not waived by failure to present the point in the lower court. Carrv. UnitedStates, 98 U. S.433, 438; Stanley v. Schwalby, 162 U. S.255, 270.
Prior to conveyance of legal title to the heirs of the Indian allottee the Secretary of the Interior has. jurisdiction to reconsider a determination of heirship.
The statutory direction that the Secretary's decision shall be "final and conclusive" is addressed to the courts. Hallowell v. Commons, 239 U. S.506; Pearsonv. Williams, ·202 U. S.281.
The decided- cases settle the general rule. Brown v. Hitchcock, 173 U. S.473; Knight v. Lane, 228 U. S.6.
In this case the legal title beyond all doubt remains in the United States. United States v. Rickert, 188 U. S. 432.
The judgment of the Secretary cannot be controlled by mandamus. The petition was premature.

241 U. S.

Argument for Defendant in Error.

Mr. Irving F. Baxter, with whom Mr. Norris Brown, Mr. Edward F. Colladay and Mr. Howard Saxton-were on the brief, for the defendant in error:
There is no disagreement as to the facts. The petition of the relators and the return thereto are in substantial accord. The demurrer to the return and the assignments of error appearing in the record present, in substance, the following propositions of law:
The Secretary of the Interior is without jurisdiction to annul a decision of his predecessor relating to property rights because such decision is a judicial act and can only be reviewed, if reviewable at all, by the courts.
The Secretary of the interior is without power under the act of June 25, 1910, to review, vacate or ignore the
decree of adoption entered by the County Court. The decree of adoption of the County Court, acting
within its jurisdiction, from which no appeal was taken, is not subject to collateral attack, and the Secretary of the Interior is without power or jurisdiction to annul, modify, vacate or ignore said decree.
Harrison Tebo, who made the application to have the decision of the Secretary of the Interior heretofore rendere' . in favor of these relators reviewed and vacated, together with all other blood relatives of the deceased, are estopped in law to question the validity of said decree of adoption, said decree being final and binding upon deceased in his lifetime and upon his heirs after his death.
The petition of the relators to the Secretary of the Interior under the provisions of the act of May 8, 1906, to issue to them patents in fee simple presented but one question within the jurisdiction of the Secretary to decide, namely, whether said applicants were capable of managing their own affairs and were hence entitled to such patents. Said petition did not, and could not, raise any issue as to their heirship.

OCTOBER TERM, 1915.

Opinion of the Court.

241 U. S.

Mr. Charles J. Kappler -and Mr. Harry L. Keefe, by leave of the court, filed a brief as amici curiw.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the court.

The relators, who are defendants in error, invoked the aid of the trial court to control by mandamus the action of the Secretary of the Interior concerning an allotment in severalty of land made to an Indian in pursuance of the authority conferred by the act of February 8, 1887 (c. 119, 24 Stat. 388), entitled "An Act to provide for the allotment of lands in severalty to Indians on the various reservations." Under the facts stated in his return to the alternative rule the Secretary, asserting
that the land embraced by the allotment in question was held in trust by the United States for the benefit of the allottee and that the official action sought to be prohibited was not subject to judicial control because it was one of exclusive administrative authority, denied that there was a right to grant the relief prayed. The return was demurred to as stating no ground for withholding the relief. The trial court overruled the demurrer and discharged the rule but the court below reversed and, holding that the Secretary had no power to take the action which it was alleged he intended to take concerning the allotment in question, awarded the mandamus prayed (43 App. D. C. 414), and the correctness of this ruling is the question now to be decided.
The facts are these: Tiebault was a Winnebago Indian living on the tribal reservation in Nebraska and in August, 1887, received an allotment in severalty of the tribal land to which he was entitled made in virtue of the act of 1887. That act after conferring authority upon the Secretary of the Interior to make allotments of tribal lands as therein specified, directed that official to issue

LANE v. MICKADIET.

Opinion of the Court.

to the allottees patents, which "shall be of legal effect, and declare that the United States does and will hold the lands thus allotted, for the period of twenty-five years, in trust for the sole use and benefit of the Indian to whom such allotment shall have been made, or, in case of his decease, to his heirs according to the laws of the State or Territory where such land is located, and that at the expiration of such period the United States will convey the same by patent to said Indian, or his heirs as aforesaid, in fee, discharged of said trust and free of all charge or encumbrance whatsoever: Provided, That the President of the United States may in any case in his discretion extend the period." (Section 5.)
About ten years after the allotment Tiebault having continued to reside on the land and to enjoy the same conformably to the statute, began proceedings in the court of Thurston County, Nebraska, for the adoption as his children of the two relators, who were also Winnebago Indians, and a decree of adoption as prayed was entered. When ten years after the adoption Tiebault died without surviving issue, the adopted children, asserting rights as his sole heirs, sought the possession of the land embraced by the allotment and of some other land which had'also been covered by an allotment made to a daughter of Tiebault, who died before him without issue and which land he had therefore inherited. This claim of heirship was disputed by nephews and nieces of Tiebault claiming to be his next of kin. The result was the commencement of proceedings in the District Court of the United States for the District of Nebraska on the part of the adopted children to obtain a recognition of their right of heirship, the nephews and nieces being among the parties defendant. Considerable testimony was taken, but no decree was entered because by the act of May 8, 1906 (c. 2348, 34 Stat. 182) and the act of June 25, 1910 (chap. 431, section 1, 36 Stat. 855) it resulted that the District Court was

without power to proceed further, exclusive jurisdiction over the subject having been conferred by the acts in question upon the Secretary of the Interior. The pertinent provisions of the act last referred to are in the margin.1
The theatre of the controversy was therefore by the assent of the parties and of the United States transferred to the Interior Department where testimony was begun before an examiner, and the Secretary of the Interior, in
June, 1913, entered an order in favor of the adopted children, holding them to be the lawful heirs of Tiebault and entitled under the statute to the ownership and enjoyment of the allotted lands.
The Secretary having been given authority both by
the sixth section of the act of 1906 and by the provisions of the act of 1910 which we have quoted to reduce the twenty-five year period, the recognized heirs applied for an order terminating the trust period and for the issue to them of a fee simple patent. This application was opposed by the next of kin who had been parties to the previous proceeding as to heirship and they also asked

1"That when any Indian to whom an allotment of land has been
made, or may hereafter be made, dies before the expiration of the trust period and before the issuance of a fee simple patent, without having
made a will disposing of said allotment as hereinafter provided, the Secretary of the Interior, upon notice and hearing, under such rules as he may prescribe, shall ascertain the legal heirs of such decedent, and his decision thereon shall be final and conclusive. If the Secretary of the Interior decides the heir or heirs of such decedent competent to manage their own affairs, he shall issue to such heir or heirs a patent in fee for the allotment of such decedent; if he shall decide one or more
of the heirs to be incompetent, he may, in his discretion, cause such lands to be sold: Provided, That if the Secretary of the Interior shall find that the lands of the decedent are capable of partition to the advantage of the heirs, he may cause the shares of such as are competent, upon their petition, to be set aside and patents in fee to be issued to
them therefor."

to be permitted to re-open the controversy as to the validity of the adoption and the heirship resulting from it on the ground that as the result of newly discovered evidence they desired to show that the Nebraska decree of adoption and the previous administrative order had been obtained by fraud. Under this request it would seem that considerable testimony was taken, but it was never acted upon because the recognized heirs, the relators, disputed the authority of the Secretary to re-open the controversy on the ground that the previous departmental order recognizing them as heirs was not subject to be reopened or reviewed and in any event that the decree of adoption of the Nebraska court was beyond the competency of the Secretary to review or set aside even upon the charges of fraud which were made.. Without passing upon the merits involved in the claim to re-open, or expressing any opinion concerning the conclusiveness of the Nebraska decree, the Secretary granted the application to re-open and ordered the issues thereon to stand for future consideration. Thereupon the petition for mandamus was filed, to which a return was made alleging the facts to be as we have stated them, resulting in the judgment of the court below awarding the mandamus which is before us for review.
It is undoubted that the fee simple title to the land embraced by the allotment had not passed from the United States and that, as expressly stated in the granting act, the land was held in trust by the United States for the benefit of the allottees to await the expiration of the trust period fixed by law when the duty on the part of the United States of conveying the fee of the land would arise. It is equally undoubted under these conditions that the land was under the control in an administrative sense of the Land Department for the purpose of carrying out the act of Congress. As there is no dispute, and could be none, concerning the general rule that courts have no

power to interfere with the performance by the Land Department of the administrative duties devolving upon it, however much they may when the functions of that Department are at an end correct as between proper parties errors of law committed in the administration of the land laws by the Department, it must follow unless it be that this case by some exception is taken out of the general rule that there was no power in the court below to control the action of the Secretary of the Interior and reversal therefore must follow. United States v. Schurz, 102 U. S. 378, 396; Brown v. Hitchcock, 173 U. S. 473; Knightv. Lane, 228 U. S. 6. But as the court below rested its conclusion of power solely upon the existence of: an assumed exception to the general rule, and as the correctness of that view is the sole ground relied upon to sustain the judgment, that question is the single subject for consideration and we come to dispose of it.
The exception rests upon two considerations: (a) the want of power of the Secretary to re-open or reconsider the prior administrative order recognizing the relators as the heirs of the deceased allottee,-an absence of authority which it is deemed resulted from the provisions of the act of 1910 which we have previously quoted in the margin; and (b) the further absence of all authority of the Secretary to disregard the decree of adoption of the Nebraska court by collaterally questioning the same in order to deprive of the status of adoption which that decree it is insisted had conclusively fixed as against all the world under the law of Nebraska.
(a) The first proceeds upon the theory that the provision of the act of 1910 to the effect that the decision of the Secretary recognizing the heirs of a deceased allottee "shall be final and conclusive" caused the prior order of the Secretary recognizing the relators as heirs to completely exhaust his power and therefore to give a character of absolute finality to such order even although the prop-

erty to which it related was yet in the administrative control of the Department because of the trust imposed by the law of the United States until the expiration of the statutory period. But we are of opinion that this is a mistaken view. The words "final and conclusive" describing the power given to the Secretary must be taken as conferring and not as limiting or destroying that authority. In other words they must be treated as absolutely excluding the right to review in the courts, as had hitherto been the case under the act of 1887, the question of fact as to who were the heirs of an allottee, thereby causing that question to become one within the final and conclusive competency of the administrative authority. As it is obvious that the right to review on proper charges of newly discovered evidence or fraud a previous administrative order while the property to which it related was under administrative control, was of the very essence of administrative authority (MichiganLand & Lumber Company v. Rust, 168 U. S. 589), it must follow that the construction upheld would not only deprive the Secretary of the final and conclusive authority which the statute in its context contemplated he should have, but would indeed render the administrative power conferred wholly inadequate for the purpose intended by the statute. And it must be further apparent that the inadequacy of authority which the proposition if accepted would bring about could not be supplied, since it would come to pass that although the property was yet in the control of the
United States to carry out the trust, there would be an absence of all power both in the administrative and judicial tribunals to correct an order once rendered, however complete might be the proof of the fraud which had procured it.
But it is said that the purpose of the statute was to give the recognized heir a status which would entitle him to enjoy the allotted land and not to leave all his rights of

enjoyment open to changing decisions which might be made during the long period of the trust term and thus virtually destroy the right of property in favor of the heir which it was the obvious purpose of the statute to protect. But in last analysis this is a mere argument seeking to destroy a lawful power by the suggestion of a possible abuse. We say this because although it be conceded for the sake of the argument only that an exercise of power which was plainly an abuse of discretion depriving of the right which the statute plainly gave would be subject to correction by the courts, such concession would be here without influence sinc? there is no basis whatever upon which to rest an assumption of abuse of discretion.
(b) So far as the Nebraska decree is concerned the mistake upQn which the proposition proceeds is obvious since, conceding the premise upon which it must rest to be well founded, it affords no ground for preventing by judicial action the exercise by the Secretary of his power to determine the legal heirs and in doing so to ascertain the existence of the Nebraska judgment, the jurisdiction ratione materiw of the court by which it was rendered and the legal effect which it was entitled to receive under the law
of Nebraska. There was a suggestion in argument, which it was con-
ceded was not made in the courts below, of an absolute want of jurisdiction upon the theory that as the title of the allotted property was yet in the United States for the purposes of the trust, there could in any event be no jurisdiction over the cause, since in substance and effect it was a suit against the United States. As, however, the considerations involved in this proposition were absolutely coincident with those required to be taken into view in order to determine the power of the Secretary, we have not deemed it necessary to specially consider the subject.
It follows from what we have said that the court below wds without jurisdiction to control the conduct of the

No. 478. Argued April 19, 20, 1916.-Decided May 22, 1916.
The Seventh Amendment exacts a trial by jury according to the course of the common law, that is, by a unanimous verdict.
The first ten Amendments are not concerned with state action and deal only with Federal action.
The Seventh Amendment applies only to proceedings in courts of the United States; it does not in any manner govern or regulate trials by jury in state courts, nor does it apply to an action brought in the state court under the Federal Employers' Liability Act.
A verdict in a state court in an action under the Employers' Liability Act, which is not unanimous, but which is legal under the law of the State, is not illegal as violating the Seventh Amendment.
While a state court may enforce a right created by a Federal statute,
