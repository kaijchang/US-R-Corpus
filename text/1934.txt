BROTHERHOOD OF LOCOMOTIVE FIREMEN & ENGINEMEN ET AL. V. PINKSTON.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT.
No. 32. Argued October 16, 17, 1934.-Decided November 5, 1934.
1. In a suit in equity brought by a widow for th6 purpose of preserving and protecting her right to future participation in a fund from which she is entitled to receive a pension of so much per month during- her lifetime as long as she shall remain unmarried, the amount in controversy, determining the federal court's jurisdiction, is the present value of her interest, calculable from the amount of the monthly payment and her life expectancy. P. 99.
2. The fact .that the further payments will cease if the pensioner remarry does not render them contingent or speculative. Thompson v Thompson, 226 U. S. 551. P. 100.
3. The evidence discloses that the pensioner's "expectancy of remarriage" and its effect upon the value of her interest in the fund were subject to actuarial measurement in this case. P. 101.
.69 F. (2d) 600, affirmed.
CERTIORARI, 292 U. S. 621, to review the reversal of a decree dismissing the bill, for lack of jurisdiction, in a suit. by a widow on behalf of herself and of other beneficiaries similarly situated, for an accounting and other equitable relief in respect of a fund established by a labor association for the pensioning of.widows of their deceased mem-

M,'. Thomas Stevenso,, for petitioners. Future payments depend entirely upon the volition of
the beneficiary. The prrobability of remarriage can not even, be conjeetured. It is impossible to estimate the present value of such contingent payments.
The court below carefully excluded from consideration either the accumulated Pension Fund or the combined claims of all matured certificate holders. Jurisdiction

rested solely upon the respondent's right under the certificate which she holds. Eberhard v. Northwestern Mutual Life Ins. Co.) 241 Fed. 353; Lyon Bonding & Surety
Co. v. Karatz, 262 U. S. 77. In Thompson v. Thompson, 226 U. S. 551, jurisdiction
depended entirely upon whether the monthly payments
for maintenance of the wife and child provided for under the order of the court were contingent. That case is an exception from a well established rule.
If, as conclusively shown in. Dunbar v. Dunbar, 190 U. S. 340, it is impossible to value future payments, subject to the contingency of remarriage, for the purposes of a discharge under the Bankruptcy Act, how can this be done for the purpose of acquiring federal jurisdiction, in-the face of the strict rule of construction and counter presumption governing that subject?
The doctrine of the Dunbar.case has frequently been
followed: Shanley- v. Herold, 141 Fed. 423; Herold v. Shanley, 146 Fed. 20; In re Westmoreland, 4 F. (2d) 602.
In the Thompson case no condition was stated in the court order which would of its own force aefeat the future payments. The payments were as "fixed" as humanly possible. An independent authority must act to effect any change.
The ruling below is at variance with the decisions of other federal courts and also state courts of last resort, in denying federal jurisdiction in analogous cases, namely,
those based upon insurance policies and allegations of total and permanent disability. LaVecchia v. Connecticut Mutual Life Ins. Co., 1 F. Supp. 588; Wyll v. Pacific Mutual Life Ins. Co., 3 F. )Supp. 483; Kithcartv. Metro-, politan Life Ins. Co., 1 F. Supp. 719; Reliance Life Ins.

In support of the ruling below, they cited: Thompson v. Thompson, 226 U. S. 551; Western & Atlantic R. Co. v. Railroad Commission, 261 U. S. 264; Berryman v. Board of Trustees, 222 U.

Respondent asks that a trust be declared in and of the Widows Pension Fund and that such fund, now admittedly insolvent, be administered under order of the court. The fund so referred to approximates $300,000.00 in value. This also is a proper basis for determining the question of jfrisdiction. Handley v. Stutz, 137 U. S. 366; Jones v.

Opi.Iion of the Court by MB. JUSTICE SUTHERLAND, announced by the CHmEF JuSTICE.
The Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen is an unincorporated voluntary association with headquarters in Ohio. It has a department known as the Widows' Pension Department, created in order to provide a monthly income for the widows or widowed mothers of. deceased members. The widow of a member, upon his death, is to receive a peo sion of $35 per month during her lifetime. In the event of her remarriage, the

pension is to cease. The respondent, widow of a de-
ceased member, became entitled to this pension. There-
after,-the association, following an investigation of the financial condition of the department and upon an actuarial report, determined to abolish the department. and
distribute the assets after making a lump-sum settlement ,not to exceed $1,500 with each widow' then on the pension roll. Widows refusing to settle'were'to have their
names erased from the roll, and be provisionally relegated
to another fund. Payment of monthly instalments on pensions was discontinued, beginning September 1st,.
1931.
Complainant thereupon brought suit in a federal district court, on behalf of herself and other beneficiaries similarly situated, for an accounting, -determination of priorities, and a proper liquidation and administration of the funds of the department. The federal jurisdiction -was invoked on the grodud of diversity of citizenship. The district court, after a hearing, dismissed the bill on the ground that the requisite *mount to confer jurisdiction (over $3,000) was not involved. 'The court of ap'peals reversed, 69. F. (2d) .600; upon the authority of Thompson v. Thonpson, 226 U. S. 551. Whether that court rightly, held 'that the jurisdictional amount was involved is. the only question for consideration.
The entire fund is nearly $300,000. The bill proceeds on the theory that this constitutes a trust fund, aid seeks its administration under judicial orders. Respondent urges that the: jurisdiction may well be tested by the value of the whole fund. But we put that question ' aside, since -we are of opinion that the value of respondent's own interest in the funA exceeds the jurisdictional amount.
This, it will be seen, is not an action at law to recover overdue instalments, but a suit in equity to preserve and protect a right to future participation in the fund. If

OCTOBER TERM, 1934.

the value of that right exceeds $3,000, the district court has jurisdiction.
In the Thompson case, a decree had been entered by' the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia in favor of a wife against her husband, for support. and maintenance at the rate of $75 a month, together with $500 for counsel fees. The decree was reversed by the Court of Appeals of the District. On an appeal to this court, our jurisdiction was challenged upon the ground that a sum in excess of $5,000 was not involved, as the statute at that time required. While the instalments already accrued amounted to much less than that, it was held that the expectancy of lifeof the parties was clearly sufficient to make up the balance, and jurisdiction was upheld. Mr. Justice Pitney, who delivered the opinion, said (p. 560)-" The future payments are not in any proper sense contingent or speculative, although they are subject to be increased, decreased or even cut off, as just indicated."
The situation there and thathere fairly cannot be distinguished. The life expectancy of respondent, as shown by the mortality 'tables, is enough to bring the value of the future pension instalments, as of the date of the suit, to a sum much in excess of $3,000; and as to that no point is made. The jurisdictional defect said to exist is that the payments are to cease in the event of respondent's remarriage; and this condition, petitioners say, makes future, payments depend entirely upon the volition .of the widow, and whether they may accrue is, therefore, a matter. of pure speculation. Indeed, the happening of the event does not dep6nd (if that would matter) upon. the widow's volition alone, but equally upon the willingness of another to mary her. Continuance of payments during the life of the respondent is fixed by contract quite as definitely as continuance of payments for maintenance in the Thompson case was fixed by decree, and subject to substantially like conditions subsequent. In the Thomp-

son case the payments were subject to be cut off entirely, not only by death: but, the court said, "in the event of a change in the circumstances of the parties." The same is true here. In no respect are we able to see any difference in principle between the two cases. -The occurrence of the specified event which would put an end to the obligation is no more uncertain in the one case than in 'the other.
Moreover, the evidence discloses that the expectancy of remarriag6 and its effect upon -the value of the pension are capable of actuarial determitation. The law of averages applies in respect of that event, as it does in respect of, death and of other events. Mr. Pipe, an actuary called as a witness by petitioners, testified that the value of respondent's right to receive $35 a'month so long as
she remained unmarried was, in round figures, $6,000 as. of August 1, 1931. A report made to the Brotherhood, *filed June 2, 1932, by its Committee on Constitution, which seems -to have been made after careful study, contains the statemeAt:
"The 'present value' can be determined if we know the average ages of widows corresponding to the ages at the death of members, and we knoW the proportion of widows who-remarry. This information is available from the records of Pension Funds. For example, if w'e, know that the average, age of the widows of members who die at age 40, is 36, then the value of the benefit in event of death at 40, is the present value of a pension of $420 per annum on the life of a woman aged 36, taking into account the chances of remarriage. The benefit has a definite 'lump sum' value on the death of the member, . . ."
Counsel upon both sides have cited and discussed decisions of this and other courts bearing upon the general subject. We have examined these decisions, but find it unnecessary to review or distinguish them. We agree with the court below: that the question of jurisdiction here

2. The ascertainment of the value'of a railway system is not a matter of arithmetical calculation and is rt governed by any fixed and definite rule. Facts of great variety and number, estimates that are exact and those that are approximations, forecasts based on probabilities and contingencies have bearing and properly may be taken into account to guide judgment in determining what is the money equivalent-the actual value-of the property. P. 109.
3. An apportionment of system. value of a railroad for taxation in one of several States traversed by its lines can not be adjudged arbitrary merely because the mileage basis was used, although the average value per mile in that State was much less than for the system as a whole, where the mileage ratio was applied not singly but combined with others, such as the ratios of the traffic units, use of rolling stock and average of gross and net operating revenue in that State to the system totals; where -the computation was tested by other criteria, such as the relations between cost of reproduction less depreciation ol .the local property and system value and between operating.iet revenues derived from that property and those earned by the system; and where there is nothing to show that.the assessment was excessive.

§ 5918] against the distributees to recover of them the amount of the liability, not exceeding the amount of the distributive share received by each." On the second appeal, the court overruled the contention that the liability of each distributee was limited to the amount of the bank stock he received from the estate. And this court, following and interpreting these decisions and affirming the judgment, held that, although the property had been allotted and delivered to the persons thereunto entitled under the decree of the probate court, the estate had not been extinguished but continued to exist subject to the liability defined in § 66. As by Minnesota law-contrary to that of Utah--decedent's estate after distribution continued to be subject to the enforcement of claims, that case does not support respondent's contention here.
The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and that of the District Court is affirmed.

MR. JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.

March 17, 1927, Moses Green, of Sumter County, South Carolina, died testate. He left three sons, a daughter and a deceased son's three minor children. His will was established in probate court; the execytor qualified and entered upon his duties. The residuary estate contained 20 shares of stock of the City National Bank of Sumter, which were distributed by the executor and tr/ansferred on the books of the bank: four shares to each of testator's children and four to the three minors. The executor was discharged. The bank continued for several years thereafter to carry on as a going concern. Then it closed because of insolvency and was put in the hands of a receiver, the petitioner. The Comptroller made an assessment of $100 a share. No payment having been made on account of the

165

Opinion of the Court.

four shares in the names of the minors, an administratrix de bonis non with the will annexed was appointed. She refused to pay the assessment. The undivided interest in real estate received by the distributees under the testator's will is worth more than $2,000, the par value of the 20 shares, and the minors' interest is worth more than" $400.
Claiming under Title 12, U. S. C., §§ 64 and 66, jetitioner brought this suit in the common pleas court of Sumter County against the administratrix, the sons and daughter, the minors and their guardian. He made no demand and asserted no claim against the executor. The complaint prayed judgment against the administratrix for $400 with interest and that the property taken under the will. and held by the other defendants be subjected .to. the claim. The trial court, following Rutledge v. Stackley, 162S. C. 170; 160 S.E. 429, held the minors not personally liable because legally incapable of assuming the obligation; that if living the testator would be, and therefore his estate is, liable and that petitioner is entitled to judgment against the administratrix; that the property taken by the minors under the will should be subjected to the payment of the debt and, if not sufficient, the property distributed to and held by the testator's sons and daughter. It gave judgment for petitioner in accordance with these rulings. The administratrix and minors appealed. The supreme court reversed. 173 S. C. 235; 175 S. E. 639. It held the will did not direct distribution of bank stock to the minors, but the executor allotted it to them in what he considered an orlderly and authorized division of the estate; that, as they could not assume the obligation, their property is not liable, and that, as the transfer to them was not directed by the will and the executor had no power to bind the estate, it was not liable. In support of its conclusion the court suggested that during administration there existed

OCTOBER TERM, 1934.

Opinion of the Court.

against testator's estate no claim in favor of the bank's creditors; that all debts of the estate were paid and that the executor was discharged without objection. And it said "we can see no reason why a claim which did not
exist during the orderly administration of the estate should now be brought up years after the estate closed. . . . It does not seem that either the act of Congress or the State Statute imposing liability on stockholders in banks is sufficient to cover the very peculiar facts existing in this case."
Respondent maintains that no federal question is involved. To the extent the opinion implies that liability of stockholders of national banks is a creature of or depends upon a statute of South Carolina, the assumption is so plainly without foundation as to suggest that it must have been inadvertently made. The court's ruling that the estate is not liable for the assessment necessarily depends upon its construction of § 66. The judgment is reviewable here under § 237 (b), Judicial Code.
For the want of capacity the minors are not subject to the assessment. The shares, though in form transferred to their names on the books of the bank, actually continued to be and still are a part of the testator's estate. Early v. Richardson, 280 U. S. 496, 499. Cf. McNair v. Darragh,31 F. (2d) 906. And the estate continued to be liable as a stockholder under § 66. The liability was not
by the Congress intended to be limited to property, actually in the hands of the personal representative when the bank became insolvent or when the comptroller's assessment was made. Section 64 imposes liability upon the stockholder while living., Section 66 lays the same burden upon his estate. The purpose of the latter is to make the estate liable for the comptroller's assessment, made after the stockholder's death, just as it is liable for decedent's indebtedness arising before he died.

penter, 84 Fed. 747, 751. Cf. Matteson v. Dent, 176 U. S.

521. The obligation continues unimpaired until valid assignment of the shares by final distribution of the estate, if not by an earlier trafnsfer. Forrest v. Jack, decided this day, ante, p. 158. Our attention has not been called to any South Carolina statute purporting to, and the state supreme court did not hold that any law of the State does, bar the enforcement of the assessment on the ground it was not made before the discharge of the executor. The decree of the court by which he was discharged, while having the effect of vacating the office, did not operate to extinguish the estate, and so the administratrix de bonis non with the will annexed became the personal representative of the testator and is liable as the testator would be if he were living and owned the stock. As suggested in Forrest v. Jack, supra, the enforcement of liability imposed by § 66 may not be thwarted or impeded by state law. The state court failed to enforce that liability. It should have held that petitioner is entitled to judgment against the administratrix for the indebted.iess owing by the estate on account of the four shares standing in the names of the minors, and that the judgment be enforced against property owned by testator when he died and now held by his children'and grandchildren.

shares to their son, who is the petitioner here, and their
daughter. The will was probated in the district court of Juab county, Utah, and petitioner was appointed administrator with the will annexed. Before decree of distribution he and the daughter transferred all their rights to their mother.
March 11, 1920, the court made an order reciting that the estate had been closed, and approved and settled the administrator's final account, and on the next day it entered its decree directing that the property belonging to the estate be distributed to the widow. The administrator made distribution as ordered. The property so transferred included the bank stock, other personal property and real property. Shortly after the distribution, the widow deeded to her daughter some of the real estate and to the petitioner the balance which is still held by him and worth more than $2,000. Respondent says, and we assume, that these conveyances were made without consideration. As petitioner knew, the stock was not transferred on the books of the bank but continued to stand in the name of his father.
After distribution the bank paid a dividend to its stockholders and sent petitioner a check payable to the estate
covering the amount applicable to the six shares. He deposited the check in his mother's account in the bank, informed its officers that the stock belonged to her, and suggested that thereafter checks for dividends be made to her. July 4, 1931, she died, having no property other than the bank stock. November 17, 1931, petitioner applied to the court to be discharged as his father's administrator. November 18, having found the certificates covering the six shares among his mother's effects, he delivered them to the bank to be held for her estate. December 1, the court granted his application for discharge. The bank closed the same day. The Comptroller appointed respondent receiver and, March 8, 1932, made an

assessment of $100 on each share of the stock. Petitioner refused to pay the assessment on the shares formerly
owned by his father. The complaint asserts devastavit in that the petitioner
as administrator failed to pay into court or to retain property sufficient to cover the assessment, or to transfer the stock to a solvent person, and disposed of the entire estate except the stock. It also alleges that the real property deeded petitioner by his mother, having been conveyed to him without consideration, is subject to a lien for the amount of the assessment. The case was tried without a jury. At the close of the evidence, respondent moved for judgment against petitioner personally and, if that be denied, for transfer of the case to the equity side and a decree against the real property. Petitioner moved for judgment. The court denied respondent's motion and granted that of petitioner. The Circuit Court of Appeals held petitioner had not committed devastavit, but that, as the stock stood on the books of the bank in the name of the deceased, his estate remained liable and that petitioner held the real property
subject to the assessment. It remanded the case to the district court, directed its transfer to equity, and that decree be entered in conformity with its opinion.
Title 12, U. S. Code, § 64, provides that "The stockholders of every national banking association shall be held individually responsible for all contracts, debts, and engagements of such association, each to the amount of his stock therein, at the par value thereof in addition to the amount invested in such stock. . . ." And see § 63. Section 66 provides that "Persons holding stock as executors, administrators, guardians, or trustees, shall not be personally subject to any liabilities as stockholders; but the estates and funds in their hands shall be liable in like manner and to the same extent as the testator, intestate, ward, or person interested in such trust funds

The liability of stockholders is based upon the statute, § 64.1 As a general rule, the person in whose name the stock stands on the books of the bank is liable,' but the actual owner may be held although the stock has not been registered in his name. The liability does not altogether cease on the death of the owner but, as limited and defined by § 66, attaches to his estate.4 The fiduciaries are exempt but the property belonging to the estate is liable as would be the deceased if living. No cause of action arises until the assessment is made by the Comptroller and, so far as concerns the need and amount, his findings are conclusive. He acts under federal authority, and in respect of determinations, orders and assessments may not be trammeled, controlled or prevented by state laws.6

FORREST v. JACK.

158

Opinion of the Court.

In the absence of federal enactments relating to procedure for enforcement of the liability imposed by § 66, collection is to be made in accordance with state laws governing claims against estates of deceased persons, at least to the extent that such laws are not inconsistent with enforcement of the liability imposed by national authority." There is no suggestion that the laws of the State of Utah
discriminate against or are inadequate for the just and convenient enforcement of liability imposed, § 66, against estates of deceased stockholders. There can be no liability on account of assessments made after complete administratijn, final distribution of all the property and the extinguishment of the estate.
In this case, the Comptroller's assessment was made more than eleven years after complete distribution and long after decedent's widow as distributee became the actual, though not the registered, owner of the stock, and liable under § 64. The decree of March 11, 1920, closed the estate. The fact that the administrator was not formally discharged until December 1, 1931, about the time the bank failed, is without significance here, as the Comptroller's assessment was not made until March 8, 1932. As the estate had ceased to exist before the bank became insolvent, the Circuit Court of Appeals rightly held that petitioner as administrator was not required by Utah law (R. S., 1933, § 102-9-26) to retain or pay into court any property or money to cover possible future liability in respect of the stock that had been decreed and distributed to the widow. There is nothing to support the allegation of devastavit.
Section 102-9-28 provides: "When the accounts of the administrator or executor have been settled and an order

made for the payment of debts and distribution of the estate, no creditor whose claim was not included in the order for payment has any right to call upon the creditors who have been paid, or upon the heirs, devisees or legatees, to contribute to the payment of his claim. Viewed in the light of that provision, it is plain that the distribution fully extinguished the estate. It follows that petitioner's real estate that had belonged to decedent never became liable for the assessment.
In Matteson v. Dent, 176 U. S. 521, relied on by the court below and by respondent, this court, affirming the supreme court of Minnesota (70 Minn. 519, 73 N. W. 416; 73 Minn. 170, 75 N. W. 1041) held the estate not to have been extinguished when the bank became in-
solvent or when the assessment was made. The facts of that case were similar to those now before us. The estate of a deceased stockholder of a national bank was, after administration, fully distributed without a transfer of the stock on the books of the bank. Later, because of its insolvency, the Comptroller closed the bank and made an assessment against its stockholders. He brought suit and obtained judgment against Idistributees under and in accordance with the General Statutes of Minnesota, 1894, § 5918, which declares: "The next of kin of a deceased person are liable to an action by a creditor of the estate, to recover the distributive shares received out of such estate, or so much thereof as may be necessary to satisfy his debt . . ." That this statute utterly differs from that of Utah (§ 102-9-28) clearly appears from the opinions of the Minnesota supreme court. In the first one it said (p. 522): "The claim here in question was a contingent claim, which did not become absolute until after the time to file claims had expired, and the estate was distributed to the widow, heirs and next of kin. Under these circumstances, the plaintiff may maintain an action under G. S., 1894, c. 77, [which includes

§ 5918] against the distributees to recover of them the amount of the liability, not exceeding the amount of the distributive share received by each." On the second appeal, the court overruled the contention that the liability of each distributee was limited to the amount of the bank stock he received from the estate. And this court, following and interpreting these decisions and affirming the judgment, held that, although the property had been allotted and delivered to the persons thereunto entitled under the decree of the probate court, the estate had not been extinguished but continued to exist subject to the liability defined in § 66. As by Minnesota law-contrary to that of Utah--decedent's estate after distribution continued to be subject to the enforcement of claims, that case does not support respondent's contention here.
The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and that of the District Court is affirmed.

1. The liability of a decedent's estate to be assessed as stockholder of a national bank for the debts of the bank, depends upon the federal law, Title 12 U. S. C., §§ 64, 66; and a ruling of a state court against such liability necessarily depends upon a construction of that law and is reviewable under § 237 (b) of the Judicial Code. P. 168.

The transmission from the dead to the living of a partic-

The personal property of Mr. Clarke, including the paintings in question, passed to the legatees named in his will by virtue of the laws of New York and not of Pennsylvania. FirstNationalBank v. Maine, 284 U. S. 312, 327, 329.
The will was admitted to probate in New York, the State of Mr. 'Clarke's domicile. It derived all its authenticity as a will and all its capacity to transmit property, from the judicial proceeding in New York. Pennsylvania added nothing to the validity of the will or probate,.

tax, in spite of the fact that in the case of stock something would have to be done in Pennsylvania, subject to Penn-
sylvania law, to complete the transfer. The devolution by will or by intestacy of real property
has, on the contrary, always been governed not by the law of the owner's domicile, but by that of the situs of the property. The State, being vitally interested, as a matter of essential public policy, in the personnel of the owners of its soil, has consistently refused to recognize any law other than its own as governing the right to transmit real property, and this Court has recognized this in sustaining
the right. of the State of the situs of realty to impose inheritance tax on the real estate of a foreign decedent and in denying that right to the State of the owner's domicile. " Under the decisions of this Court, the situs for inheri-
tance taxation was New York and not Pennsylvania. Frick v. Pennsylvania, 268 U. S. 473; Farmers Loan & Trust Co. v. Minnesta, 280 U. S. 204; First National Bank v. Maine, 284 U. S. 312.
Blodgett v. Silberman, 277 U. S. 1, is to be distinguished. It did not there appear that the coin and.bank notes had ever been in Connecticut or that they were ever to be taken or kept or used by the decedent there. From the fact that they were kept in the safe deposit box in New York, it would appear that they were for use in connection with the decedent's New York business. This Court considered that this cash had been so definitely fixed and separhted in its actual situs from the person of the owner that it belonged permanently in New York, as did the paintings and furniture in the Frick case.
Johnson Oil Refining Co. v. Oklahoma, 290 U. S. 1584 involved the habitual employment of property away frornt the domicile.

ness or, as in the Frick case, intimately connected with real estate, can acquire a situs away from the owner's domicile sufficient to support inheritance taxation by the State of the situs, still the Clarke pictures would fall far short either of the test of the habitual employment of property within, the foreign Stafe, or that of the place where the property was kept and used.
Cf. Hays v. Pacific Mail S. S. Co., 17 How. 596; Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, 199 U. S. 194; Delaware, L. & W. R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, 198 U. S. 341, from which it is clear that, even in cases involving property taxes, a State other than that of the owner's domicile can constitutionally levy the tax only on property permanently located within its borders and is powerless to tax personalty which the owner has taken or sent there but temporarily and with the intentio1.of bringing it back home When the object for which it was sent has been accomplished. A fortiori such other State is powerless to impose an inheritance tax on such property merely because its owner happens to die during the interim.
The presumption would be against a change in situs, on the analogy of those cases which hold that an original domicile is not lost until a new legal residence is clearly acquired. New York Central R. Co. v. Miller, 202 U. S. 584; Sun Printing & Publishing Assn. v. Edwards, 194 U. S. 377, 383.

Opinion of the Court.

293 U. S.

MR. JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Pennsylvania inheritance tax law imposes a tax upon the transfer by will or intestate laws of personal property within the Commonwealth when the decedent is a nonresident at the time of his death.* Thomas B. Clarke, a resident of New York, loaned paintings to a museum in Pennsylvania and died estate while they were on exhibition there. His will was admitted to probate in New York, and letters testamentary issued to appellant to which, as trustee, the residuary clause transferred the pictures. The appellees, acting respectively as attorney general and secretary. of revenue of Pennsylvania, proceeded to appraise and assess the pictures for the purpose of collecting the inheritance tadk.
Appellant, maintainiig that when the owner died the paintings had no actual situs within Pennsylvania because only temporarily there, brought this suit to enjoin enforcement on the ground that, if the statute be construed to tax the transfer by the death of the nonresident owner, it is repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. As the transfer cannot be subjected to taxes imposed by more than one state (Frick v.
Section 1 of the Act of June 20, 1919, P. L. 521, 72 P. S. § 2301,
as last amended by the Act of June 22, 1931, P. L. 690, provides in
part as follows' "Section 1. Be it enacted, etc., That a tax shall be, and is hereby,
imposed upon the transfer of any property, real or personal, or of any interest therein or income therefrom in trust or otherwise, to persons or corporations in the following cases:

"(b) When the transfer ii by will or intestate laws of real property within this Commonwealth, or of goods, wares, or merchandise within this Commonwealth, or of shares of stock of corporations of
this Commonwealth or of national banking associations located in this Commonwealth, and the decedent was a nonresident of the Commonwealth at the time of his death."

S. 312, 326-327.) appellant framed its complaint to call for a decision whether Pennsylvania or New York is entitled to the tax. The New York Tax Commission as amicus curiae, filed. briefs below and also in this court supporting the claim that the transfer is subject to the New York tax.
The district court, consisting of three judges, § 266, Jud. Code, dismissed the: suit on the ground that appellint had an adequate remedy at law. This court reversed and remanded the tase with instructions to reinstate the bill and proceed to a hearing upon the merits. City Bank Farmers Trust Co. v. Schnader, 291 U. S. 24. Then the case was submitted and tried on the facts alleged in the bill and answer and additional 'ones that were stipulated by the parties. Upon the circumstances detailed in its findings the court concluded that 79 portraits: belonging to Clarke that were included in the collection on exhibition in the Pennsylvania museum at the time of his death ten: had . an-atual situs in that State; and held the transfer subject to the Pennsylvania inheritance tax.
The material substance of the findings follows:
In March, 1928, Clarke at the request of the director of :the Pennsylvania museum, loaned to it the 79 pictures, together with 85 others owned by a corporation of which henwas sole stockholder. At the time of the loan, they were, and long had been, kept in New York City. Five were at his residence, ten were on exhibition, and the remaining 64 were in storage. When the pictures were sent to Pennsylvania, Clarke surrendered his lease for the storage space and thereafter did nothing to secure another place in which to put them. But suitable space was always readily available in New York. ·

OCTOBER TERM, 1934.

Opinion of the Court.

293 U. S.

The arrangement with the museum was oral; no consid-
eration was to be paid, and it was understood that at any time on Clarke's request the pictures would be returned to him. In the spring of 1929, Clarke wrote the director, at the latter's solicitation, that he would sell the entire collection at a stated price to anyone who would present it to the museum, it being understood that he would allow the pictures to remain at the museum for a reasonable
time for the director to find such a donor. In May, 1930, he 'stated that this arrangement would terminate June 17, 1930. But at the director's request he permitted the pic-
tures to remain, upon the understanding that, whenever he so requested, they would be returned to him in New York. Thereafter, he was wling to sell the collection 'as a whole for presentation to the Pennsylvania museum or to a substantially similar institution.
Clarke made no definite plans or request for the return to New. York of the paintings. None was ever removed from the museum except four which, at his request, were sent to Virginia in April, 1929, for exhibition, and were returned in May. When he died, January 18, 1931, all
the paintings were at.the museum. The museum was-not conducted for profit. It secured
through voluntary loans from nonresidents a substantial portion of the works of art which it displayed. None of these was regarded or intended as a permanent loan. It is customary for public museums to secure pictures for; exhibition in this manner. The period elapsing until Clarke's death was shorter than the usual period of such
loans. The power to regulafe the transmission, administratiop
and distribution of tangible personal property rests exclusively in the State in which the property has an actual situs, regardless of the domicile of the owner. If at the time of his death the actual situs of Clarke's pictures was in Pennsylvania, they were wholly under the jurisdiction

CITY BANK CO. v. SCHNADER.

112

Opinion of the Court.

of that State. The fact that being a resident of New York he, by will probated in that State, disposed of the pictures detracted nothing from the exclusive jurisdiction of Pennsylvania to tax the transfer effected by his death. New York laws had no bearing other than that attributable to their implied adoption by Pennsylvania. As-suming actual situs in Pennsylvania, the paintings there on exhibition when the owner died are not .to be distinguished, so far as concerns the imposition of the inheritance tax, from land located within that State. Frick v. Pennsylvania. supra, 489-493.
We regard as unimportant and negligible Clarke's suggestions that the pictures be returned, because on each .occasion he acceded to opposing suggestions of the director and continued his consent that they remain temporarily at the museum subject to his orders. Mere floating intention that sometime in. the future the pictures would be returned to New York was not sufficient to re-
tain them within the jurisdiction of that State and to keep them without the jurisdiction of Pennsylvania. Cf. Story, Conflict of Laws, 8th ed., § 46. And obviously without weight are the facts that Clarke made the loan without pay, gave up the warehouse in which he had kept some of the pictures, and died without providing a place for them in New York.
The significant features of the transaction are these: Prior to the loan the pictures that went' to make up the collection had an actual situs in New York. The loan' was not made for a short and definite period and it was subject to the right of the owner to.have the pictures returned to New York at any time. He did not call for their return but with his consent they were kept in Pennsylvania and there exhibited until he died two years and ten months after the loan. With-the exception of the four pictures temporarily sent to Virginia, none was taken from Pennsylvania. For-nearly two years next preced-

ing his death Clarke was willing-indeed, he authorized the director-to sell the collection to anyone who would
buy at the specified price and donate them to the, Pennsylvania museum. And during the last six months of his life he was willing to sell to any purchaser that would give them to any institution similai-to the Pennsylvania museum. It does not appear that Clarke ever intended to have the pictures returned to New York at any definite date or upon the happening of any event. or at all.
Until his death he permitted the pictures to 'be kept and used in the Pennsylvania museum merely subject to his right at any time to order them taken to New York or
elsewhere. In respect of situs for taxation, the collection of por-
traits .is quite unlike vessels and railway rolling stock. that in *fulflling the purpose for. which they are created move from place to place and into different States. Cf.
Hays v. Pacific.Mail Steamship Co., 17 How. 596, 599. Pullman's Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, 141 U. S. 18, 23. Johnson Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, 290 U. S. 1581 161. Before the loan was made the pictures had an actual situs in New York, so as to be viithin the taxing power of that' State, though it cannot be said that they were there permanently located in the sense of that phrase when used in respect of land, buildings or other items of fixed real property. The location of the portraits in Pennsylvania was not merely transient, transitory or temporary but it was fixed in an established abiding place in which they remained for a long time. Undoubtedly, they becamesubject to the taxing power of the State. Cf. Brown v. Houston, 114 U. S. 622, 632-633. Pittsburg& Southern Coal Co. v. Bates, 156 U. S. 577, 589. Kelley v. Rhoads, 188 U. S. 1, 7' General Oil Co. v. Crain, 209 U. S. 211, 230. By sending them into Pennsylvania and by his omission to have them returned to New York, and his lack of definite intention ever so to do, Clarke failed to

1. Where a corporation, without change of its'accounting year, filed a separate return for he part of the year 1925 which preceded its affiliation with. another corporation, and filed a consolidated return for the remainder of. the year, the periods covered by. the two returns are not separate " taxable years" but are each a part of the taxable. year as previously constituted, within the meaning of § 206 (b) of the Revenue Act of 1926, which permits a taxpayer to carry over and to deduct during the next two "taxable years" a net loss sustained "for any taxable year." P. 124 et seq.
2. Section 200 (a) of the same. Act, in providing that "the term 'taxable year' includes, in the case of a fractional part of a year, the period for which such return is made," does not compel a different result. Pp. 124-126.
3. While the term "includes " may sometimes be taken as synonymous with " means," it may be used also as the equivalent of "comprehends" or "embraces." Therefore, under § 200 (a), the phrase "taxable year" may, where the context requires it, be taken to embrace all fractional parts of the taxable year; thus, "loss sustained for any taxable year," which § 206 permits to be carried forward and deducted from gross income for two successive years, includes a loss shown in a fractional part of the first preceding taxable year for which separate returns are filed. Pp. 124-126.
4. In view of tle extent to 'which the practice of fixing the tax with reference to the twelve months" accounting periods of the taxpayer has been recognized and carried into .the structure of the revenue acts, only clear and compelling language added to § 200 (a) to define the phrase "taxable year" would justify application of that phrase in the remedial § 206 to periods of less than twelve months,

No. 602. Argued April 11, 12, 1935.-Decided April 29, 1935.
1. Under the Revenue Acts of 1921 and 1924, the basis for computing gain or loss on the sale of property of an estate, and its depletion or depreciation, for the purposes of taxing income returnable by an executor, is its value at the decedent's death, rather than its cost to the decedefit or its value on March 1, 1913, if acquired before that date. Pp. 217-218.
2. The reenactment, without material change, of the pertinent provisions of § 202 of the Revenue Act of 1921 was a congressional recognition and approval of the interpretation of the section by the treasury regulations, which gave them the force of law. P. 220.

The incorporation into § 113 (a) (5), Revenue Act of 1928, of the substance of the Treasury Regulation prescribing that gains or losses of an estate should be computed" on the basis of the value of the property at the date of the decedent's death, was intended to clarify the law, not to change it.

Opinion of the Court.

Mr. H. C. Fulton, with whom Messrs. H. B. Fryberger and E. L. Boyle were on the brief, for petitioner.

Mr. David E. Hudson, with whom Solicitor General Biggs, Assistant Attorney General Wideman, and Messrs. James W. Morris and A. F. Prescott were on the brief, for respondent.

MR. JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, 72 F. (2d) 352, affirmed a ruling of the Board of Tax Appeals, 27 B. T. A. 952, and held that under § 202 of the Revenue Act of 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 227, 229, and § 204 of the Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 253, 258, the basis for computing gain or loss on the sale of property, and its depletion or depreciation, for purposes of taxing income returned by the petitioner, an executor, is its value at the date of the decedent's death, rather than the cost to the decedent, or the value on March 1, 1913, if acquired before that date.
We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict of the decision below, and of the like decision, under § 202 of the 1918 Revenue Act, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1060, of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Eldredge v. United States, 31 F. (2d) 924, 930, with that of the Court of Claims in McKinney v. United States, 62 Ct. Cls. 180. See Elmhirst v. United States, 38 F. (2d) 915; Myers v. Uhited States, 51 F. (2d) 145; compare McCann v. United States, 48 F. (2d) 446, each- decided by the Court of Claims.
Petitioner's tax returns' were for the calendar years 1924 and 1925. Sections 202 (a), (b) and 214 (a) (8), (10)

of the 1921 Act, and § 204 (a), (b), (c) of the Revenue Acts of 1924 and 1926, c. 77, 44 Stat. 9, provide that the basis for computing gain or loss on the sale of property, and depreciation and depletion, shall be its cost, or its value on March 1, 1913, if acquired before that date. None of the acts specifically provides a basis for making the computations where return- is made of income received by the estate of a decedent in the course of administration. But in the case of property acquired by "bequest, devise, or inheritance" § 202 (a) (3) of the 1921 Act and § 204 (a) (5) of the. 1924 and 1926 Acts provide that the basis shall be the fair market value "at the time of acquisition."
The revenue acts consistently treat the estate of a decedent in the hands of an administrator or executor as a separate taxpayer. By § 2 of the 1921, 1924 and 1926 Acts the estate of a decedenf is embraced within the term "taxpayer." Each Act specifically provides for taxation of the income of an estate during administration. § 219 of- the 1921, 1924 and 1926 Acts. Each includes profits from the sale of property by the taxpayer in taxable iicome, § 213 of the 1921, 1924 and 1926 Acts, and provides for the deduction of losses from gross income in arriving at taxable income. § 214 of the 1921, 1924 and 1926 Acts. See Merchants Loan & Trust Co. v. Smietanka, 255 U. S. 509, 516, 517. Each makes provision for the imposition of a -tax upon the estates of deceased nersons, and the "gross estate" which is the basis for com-
puting the tax is the value of the decedent's property at the time of his death. § 402, 1921 Act; § 302, 1924 and 1926 Acts.
The Court of Claims held that the time of acquisition, indicated by § 202 (a) of the 1921 Act and § 204 (a) of the 1924 and 1926 Acts as the controlling date for calculating gain or loss to the estate in the course of administration, must be taken to be the. date of acquisition

HARTLEY v. COMMISSIONER.

Opinion of the Court.

by the decedent rather than the time of acquisition by the executor or administrator on the decedent's death. This conclusion, it was thought, was compelled by the statutory command that the basis of computation shall be "cost," which could have no application to the acquisition by the executor or administrator, who is not a purchaser of the estate which he administers. McKinney v. United States, supra, 188. But this specification is not enough to restrict the effect of the general provisions of these revenue acts which impose a tax on' the income, including capital gains, of taxpayers. The use of the word cost does not preclude the computation and assessment
of the taxable gains on the basis of the value of property, rather than its cost, where there is no purchase by the taxpayer, and thus no cost at the controlling date. See Heiner v. Tindle, 276 U. S. 582, 585, 586; Lucas v. Alexander, 279 U. S. 573, 578, 579.
No plausible reason has been advanced for supposing that Congress intended the capital gains or losses of the estate of a decedent to be treated any differently from those resulting from the sale of property taken by "bequest, devise, or inheritance," as provided in § 202 (a) (3) of the 1921 Act and § 204 (a) (5) of the 1924 and 1926 Acts, or that it intended to bring gains or losses, accruing between the date of decedent's acquisition of the property and his death, into the computation of both the estate tax and the income tax assessed upon his administrator or executor. When it had a different purpose in the case of gifts inter vivos, not subject to a gift tax, it specifically
directed that gains or losses to the donee should be computed on the basis of the cost of the property at the date of acquisition by the donor. § 202 (a) (2), 1921 Act; § 204 (a) (2) (4), 1924 and 1926 Acts; see Taft v. Bowers, 278 U. S. 470; Helveringv. New York Trust Co., 292 U. S. .455, 462. The conclusion seems inescapable that the intended date of acquisition by an executor or administra-

tor, where the estate is the taxpayer, is the date of the decedent's death. Brewster v. Gage,280 U. S. 327, 335.
Possibility of doubt was removed by treasury regulation. Article 343 of Regulation 45, under the 1918 Act, prescribed that gains or losses of an estate should be computed on the basis of the value of the property at the date of the decedent's death. This was carried forward by Art.
343 of Reg. 62 under the Act of 1921, of Reg. 62 under the Act of 1924, and of Reg. 69 under the Act of 1926. Following the decision of the Court of Claims in McKinney v. United States, supra,and with the purpose of conforming to it, the ruling was amended by T. D. 4011, VI-1 Cum. Bul. 77, on April 6, 1927, so as to make the cost to the decedent the basis of the computation. Doubts having been raised as to the ruling in McKitney v. United States, supra,by later decisions,2 the amendment was revoked and Article 343 restored to its original form, T. D. 4177, VII-2 Cum. Bul. 134, on July 7, 1928. The substance of the regulation in its original and final form was carried into § 113 (a) (5) of the Revenue Act of 1928, c. 852, 45 Stat. 791, 819, which directed that the basis for the computation of gains or losses upon property-acquired by the decedent's estate from the decedent should be its value at the time of the decedent's death.
The reenactment of'the pertinent provisions of § 202 of the Revenue Act of 1921 in the Acts of 1924 and 1926, without material change, was a congressional recognition and approval of the interpretation of the section by the treasury regulations, which gave them the force of law.

STEWART v. KEYES ET AL
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF OKLAHOMA.
No. 142. Argued December 6, 1934.-Decided May 20, 1935.
1. Land allotted and patented under § 28 of the Act of March 1, 1901 (Original Creek Agreement) in the right of a full-blood Creek Indian to his "heirs," without naming them, passes to them as an inheritance and not as an allotment in their own right. P. 406.
2. The restriction made by § 1 of the Act of May 27, 1908, on alienation of lands allotted to full-blood Indians of the Five Civilized Tribes, in Oklahoma, relates to land which the allottee took in his own right and not to land allotted in the right of a deceased ancestor and which came to him as an heir. P. 411.
S. The purpose of the provision of § 9 of the Act of May 27, 1908, "That the death of any allottee of the Five Civilized Tribes shall operate to remove all restrictions upon the alienation of said allottee's land: Provided, That no conveyance of any interest of any full-blood Indian heir in such land shall be valid unless approved by the court having jurisdiction of the settlement of the estate of said deceased allottee," was to prescribe rules respecting future alienation by heirs-as well where they had become such before the Act as where they might become such thereafter. P. 412.
4. The proviso above quoted from § 9 of the Act of May 27, 1908, should be read in connection with the statutes whereby'Congress authorized and recognized guardianships of estates of full-blood heirs who were minors or were mentally incompetent; and, so read, although couched in general terms, it does not require that a conveyance made by the guardian of a minor or incompetent heir pursuant to a sale directed and approved by the court having control of the guardianship shall also be approved by another court, df the same rank, having jurisdiction over the estate of the ancestor. Pp. 412, 414.
5. When Congress subjected Indian minors and incompetents of the Five Tribes and their estates to the guardianship laws of Oklahoma, it did not thereby incorporate those laws into the federal restrictions; it merely gave its assent to their application to such

Indians; and the laws remained state laws, as before, and as such were to be applied to these Indians. Apart from limitations expressly imposed by Congress, the state laws have the same application to Indian guardianships that they have when the wards are minors or incompetents of other races. P. 415. 6. Whether the proceedings in such Indian guardianships conform to the state statutes is a question of state, not federal, law. And, in the absence of congressional provision to the contrary, the time and mode of seeking the correction of errors believed to have been committed by the state courts in such proceedings, as also the effect of inaction in that regard, are all controlled by the state laws, as in the instance of other guardianship proceedings. P. 416. 7. As applied to a suit by a full-blood Creek Indian to recover an inherited allotment which, while he was of age but mentally incompetent,.was sold and coieyed by his guardian with the approval of the Oklahoma County Court, but whose right of action became barred by the state statute of limitations, § 2 of the Act of Congress of April 12, 1926, purporting to lift the bar in such cases for a period of two years following the approval of that Act, is unconstitutional. P. 416. 8. As respects suits to recover real or personal property where the right of action has been barred by a'statute of limitations and a later Act has attempted to repeal or remove the bar after it became complete, the rule sustained by reason and preponderant authority is that the removing Act can not be given effect consistently with constitutional provisions forbidding a deprivation of property without due process of law.

interest in land inherited from his grandmother, also a full-blood Creek Indian, and afterward sold by his guardian. The asserted grounds for a recovery were (1) that the proceedings whereby the plaintiff was adjudged an incompetent and subjected to guardianship on that basis, and also the proceedings leading to the sale, were invalid, because in some particulars irregular or not in accord with the laws of Oklahoma; (2) that the sale was in contravention of'a controlling federal restriction on alienation; and (3) that an act of Congress of April 12, 1926, c. 115, § 2, 44 Stat. 239, permitted the suit to be brought within
two years after the act's approval notwithstanding any bar which may have arisen under the state statutes of limitation before such approval.
The defendants answered and a trial was had at which judgment was given for them on a demurrer to the plaintiff's evidence. The Supreme Court of the State affirmed the judgment, 167 Okla. 531; 30 P. (2d) 875, and put its decision on the grounds (a) that the suit was barred by the state statutes of limitation and (b) that the act of Congress of April 12, 1926, relied on by the plaintiff as avoiding such a bar, could not be applied, because, if applied, it would deprive the defendants, who are holding under the guardian's sale, of vested rights without due process of law. The court's opinion did not mention the federal restriction on alienation set up by the plaintiff; but, of course, the judgment necessarily meant that the court regarded the asserted restriction as not requiring a different result.
The plaintiff brings the case here by appeal and com-' plains that the Supreme Court of the State erred (1) in app] ving the state statutes of limitation over his objection that they could not be applied without bringing them into conflict- with the federal statute restricting alienation, and (2) in holding the act of Congress of April 12, 1926, in-
valid as applied to the situation disclosed.

406

OCTOBER TERM, 1934.

Opinion of the Court.

295 U. S.

The facts in the light of which these complaints are to be considered are as follows:
The plaintiff and his grandmother were full-blood Indians of the Creek tribe, enrolled as such, and entitled to share in the allotment of the tribal lands among the members. ' She died before receiving her allotment, and after her death the land in question, which was part of the tribal lands, was allotted and patented in her right, the patent being issued to her "heirs" without naming them. Under the applicable statute the heirs received the land as an inheritance from -herand not as an allotment in their own right.' The plaintiff was one of the heirs. He also received an allotment in his own right; and thus, like many others, he had a personal allotment as well as an interest in inherited land.
Thereafter, in 1907, the county court of Hughes County, Oklahoma, regularly appointed John A. Jacobs guardian
of the plaintiff's person and estate, he then being a minor and that being the county of his residence. In 1914 that court entered an order (1) reciting it was made after a hearing in the plaintiff's presence and at which he was examined; (2) finding he was then over the age of 21 years, but was incompetent to manage his own affairs and still in need of a guardian; (3) also finding Jacobs, the then guardian, was a proper person to be continued as such; (4) declining to accept a resignation tendered by Jacobs; and (5) ordering that -the guardianship be continued and that thereafter Jacobs should act "as guard-
1The allotment in the right of the grandmother was made under § 28 of the act of 1901 which, after providing for the enrollment of all tribal citizens living on April 1, 1899, declares, "and if any such -citizen has died since that time, or may hereafter die, before receiving his allotment of lands and distributive share of all the funds of the tribe, the lands and money to which he would be. entitled, if living, 6hall descend to his heirs ... and be allotted and distributed to them accordingly.'

ian for Noah Stewart, incompetent," and should "be
governed by the laws relating thereto." la Jacobs assented; and the subsequent proceedings were all entitled "In the Matter of the Guardianship of Noah Stewart., an
Incompetent." In May, 1916, the guardian by a verified petition re-
quested the county court to authorize a sale of the plaintiff's interest in the inherited land for the purpose of securing money needed for his maintenance and support and for the improvement of his personal allotment. A month later the court entered an order reciting a hearit,"
on that petition after lawful notice; finding the proposed sale was necessary for the purposes named; and directing the guardian to make the sale. Under that order the guardian made the sale at public auction to the highest bidder and reported it to the county court. July 11, 1916, the court entered an order (1) finding that due notice of the intended sale was given, that the sale was fairly conducted and legally made, and that the price was not disproportionate to the value of the property; (2) confirming and approving the sale; and (3)directing the guardian to execute a deed to the purchaser. The purchase price was paid to the guardian and he executed and delivered to the purchaser a deed, which was filed for record in the proper office July 12, 1916. The purchaser then entered into possession and he and his grantees remained in possession continuously thereafter. The defendants are the present claimants under the guardian's sale.
As part of the plaintiff's evidence it was stipulated that the Secretary of the Interior had never removed any restrictions on the alienation of the inherited land and that the same thing was true of the plaintiff's personal allot-

ment. But the defendants, although joining in the stipulation, objected that the facts stipulated were immaterial.
August 4, 1917, the county court after a hearing entered an order adjudging that the plaintiff had become competent and discharging the guardian. The present suit was begun April 11, 1928.
The Supreme Court of the State in applying the state, statutes of limitation said [p. 532]:
"Under the provisions of Section 1444, 0. S. 1931, no action for the recovery of any estate, sold bz a guardian, can be maintained by the ward, unless it is commenced within three years next after the termination of the guardianship, or when a legal disability to sue exists by reason of minority or otherwise, at the time when the cause of action accrues, within three years next after the kemoval thereof. The plaintiff could have commenced his action at any time within three years after August 4, 1917. Under the provisions of Section 100, 0. S. 1931, any person entitled to bring an action for the recovery of real property, who may be under any legal disability when the cause of action accrues, may bring his action within two years after the disability is removed. Under that statute the plaintiff could have brought his action within two years after August 4, 1917. Under the provisions of the second subdivision of Section 99, 0. S.1931, an action for the recovery of real property sold by a guardian, upon an order or judgment of a court directing such sale, brought by the ward or his guardian, must be brought within five years after the date of the recording of the dekd made in pursuance of the sale. Under that statute the plaintiff could have brought his action within five years after the 12th day of July, 1916."
Under the state statutes thus described the court held that the plaintiff's asserted right to call in question the guardian's sale was barred before the suit was begun and

before the approval of the act of Congress of April 12, 1926.
1. Was the guardian's sale, as directed and approved by the county court, a forbidden alienation within the meaning of any then existing federal restriction? The plaintiff insists it was and points to the act of May 27, 1908, c. 199, 35 Stat. 312, as containing the restriction.
As a preliminary to considering that statute it will be helpful to refer to the conditions and legislation which preceded its enactment.
The Creek Tribe was one of the Five Civilized Tribes, each of which owned and occupied a tribal domain in the Indian Territory. Congress never provided a territorial
government for that Territory, but ultimately did establish local courts therein and invested them with probate, as well as civil and criminal, jurisdiction. The laws for the Territory consisted largely of Arkansas statutes put in force therein by Congress; and these statutes included chapters providing comprehensively for the administration of estates of decedents, minors and incompetents, and for the sale of their property. At first the adopted Arkansas statutes were not intended to be fully applicable to Indians, but Congress soon made them applicable to all persons, "irrespective of race,"2 and later on declared that the courts in the Territory should have "full and complete jurisdiction" of all "estates of decedents, guardianships of minors and incompetents, whether Indians, freedmen, or otherwise."3
November 16, 1907, the Territory of Oklahoma and the Indian Territory were admitted into the Union as the State of Oklahoma under an enabling act passed by Congress June 16, 1906, c. 3335, 34 Stat. 267, and amended

'Act of June 7, 1897, c. 3, 30 Stat. 62, 83. "Act of April 28, 1904, c. 1824, § 2,'33 Stat. 573.

OCTOBER TERM. 1934.

Opinion of the Court.

295 U. S.

March 4, 1907, c. 2911, 34 Stat. 1286. The enabling act and the constitution of the new State united in declaring that, with exceptions not material here, "all laws in force in the Territory of Oklahoma" at the time of the State's admission should be "in force throughout the State" and that the "courts of original jurisdiction of such State" should be the successors of "all courts of original jurisdiction of said Territories."
The laws of the Territory of Oklahoma which were thus put in force "throughout" the new State included comprehensive provisions for the administration of estates of
decedents, the appointment of guardians of minors and incompetents, and the management and sale of their property. In the Territory of Oklahoma jurisdiction over these subjects was vested in probate courts and by the constitution of the new State that jurisdiction was committed to county courts.
The lands of the Creek Tribe were .allotted among its enrolled members pursuant to the act of March 1, 1901, c. 676, 31 Stat. 861, as modified and supplemented by the acts of June 30, 1902, c. 1323, 32 Stat. 500, and March 3, 1905, c. 1479, 33 Stat. 1071. Under these acts lands allotted to living members in their own right were subjected to specified restrictions on alienation; but those allotted in the right of deceased members were left unrestricted.'
The act of April 26, 1906, c. 2876, 34 Stat. 137, substituted a system of revised restrictions made applicable to all of the Five Civilized Tribes. In § 19 it dealt with restrictions relating to lands of living allottees, and in § 22 with those relating to inherited lands, including, as
this court has held, lands allotted in the right of deceased members.' Under § 22 the right of full-blood Indian heirs to alienate the inherited lands was subjected to the

'Skelton v. Dill, 235 U. S. 206; Adkins v. Arnold, 235 U. S. 417, 420; Talley v. Burgess, 246 U. S. 104, 107.

restriction that the conveyance be approved by the Secretary of the Interior.
The act of May 27, 1908, c. 199, 35 Stat. 312, again revised the restrictions and practically substituted its § 1 for § 19 of the act of 1906, and its § 9 for § 22 of that act. Thus, like the act of 1906, it dealt with the restrictions relating to lands of living allottees separately from those relating to inherited lands.
In § 1 the act of 1908, after declaring that certain lands
of designated classes of allottees "shall be free from all restrictions," provides-
"All homesteads of said allottees enrolled as mixedblood Indians having half or more than half Indian blood, including minors of such degrees of blood, and all allotted lands of enrolled full-bloods, and enrolled mixed-bloods of three-quarters or more Indian blood, including minors of such degrees of blood, shall not be subject to alienation, contract to sell, power of attorney, or any other incumbrance prior to April twenty-sixth, nineteen hundred and thirty-one, except that the Secretary of the Interior may remove such restrictions, wholly or in part, under such rules and regulations concerning terms of sale and disposal of the proceeds for the benefit of the respective Indians as he may prescribe."
Counsel for the plaintiff place some reliance on that restriction. But there is no basis for doing so. The plaintiff's relation to the land in question was that .of an heir, and not that of an allottee' The land was allotted in the right of his deceased grandmother; so she rather than he-should be regarded as the allottee.
Section 9 relates to the alienation of inherited lands. So far as is material here it provides:
"That the death of any allottee of the Five Civilized Tribes shall operate to remove all restrictions upon the alienation of said allottee's land: Provided,That no con-
'Harris v. Bell, 254 U. S. 103, 108.

295 U. S.

veyance of any interest of any full-blood Indian heir in such land shall be valid unless approved by the court having jurisdiction of the settlement of the estate of said deceased allottee."
While this provision, if taken literally, might be regarded as confined to subsequent deaths and resulting heirships, a reading of the entire act, including its introductory sentence, shows that the purpose was to prescribe rules respecting future alienation by heirs-as well where
they had become such before the act as where they might become such thereafter. The provision has been so applied by this Court."
The first sentence in the quoted part of § 9, where not
restrained by the proviso, undoubtedly frees the inherited lands from all restrictions on alienation. But as respects an heir who is a full-blood Indian the proviso obviously iestrains that sentence and, if taken literally, makes unlawful any conveyance of any interest of such an heir in the inherited lands unless the conveyance be approved by the court having jurisdiction of the settlement of the estate of the deceased allottee. Here the heir was a fullblood Indian. So the question arises, whether the proviso is intended to include a conveyance made pursuant to a guardian's sale, such as was directed and approved by the county court in this instance.
The proviso makes no mention of minors or incompetents under guardianship or of conveyances made by their guardians under the direction of courts having jurisdiction of their estates. Under other acts of Congress the persons and estates of Indian minors and incompetents in the Indian Territory and the State of Oklahoma have long been subjected to the jurisdiction of local courts; aDd that jurisdiction is recognized throughout the allotment statutes before described and in § 2 of the act of 1908. True,

that jurisdiction could not be exercised otherwise than in keeping with the laws of Congress relating to such Indians and their lands; but this constitutes no -reason for putting aside the statutes granting and recognizing the jurisdiction when a related statute is being examined and construed.
The court which would have jurisdiction of the s'ttlement of the estate of the deceased allottee (plaintiff's grandmother) is either the same county court that directed and approved the guardian's sale or the county court in an adjoining county. So, the court named in the proviso and the one which directed and approved the guardian's sale were either identical or of the same rank.
A similar question respecting the construction and application of the proviso was considered by this court in 1920. The case involved a sale of inherited land by the guardian of minor heirs who were full-blood Creek Indians, the guardian having acted under the order of the court having control of the guadianship; and it was held that the proviso, rightly construed, did not include such a sale.
In that case the Court said:8 "If in this instance the same court had had jurisdiction of the guardianship of the minor heirs and of the settlement of the estate of the deceased allottee, no embarrassment would have ensued; but as that was not the case, the question arises, whether it was essential that the guardian's conveyance, directed and approved, as it was, by the court having control of the guardianship, should also be approved by the court having jurisdiction of the settlement of the deceased allottee's estate? The Circuit Court of Appeals answered in the negative; and, while the question is not free from difficulty, we think that solution of it is right.

"Of course, the purpose in requiring any approval is to safeguard the interests of the full-blood Indian heir. Where he is a minor he can convey only through a guardian, and no court is in a better situation to appreciate and
safeguard his interests than the one wherein the guardianship is pending. Besides, as a general rule, a guardianship carries with it exclusive power to direct the guardian and to supervise the management and disposal of the ward's property. It is so in Oklahoma. This rule is so widely recognized and so well grounded in reason that a purpose to depart from it ought not to be assumed unless manifested by some very clear or explicit provision ... The proviso does not mention minors under guardianship;
and to regard its general words as including them will either take all supervision of the sale of their interest in inherited lands from the court in which the guardianship is pending, or subject that court's action to the approval of another court of the same rank. In either event conflict and confusion will almost certainly ensue and be detrimental to the minor heirs. But, if the proviso be regarded, as well it may, as referring to heirs not under guardianship . . . all full-blood heirs will receive the measure of protection intended. We think this is the true construction."
In principle what was said there is applicable here. That the Indian heir in that case was a minor and in this was an incompetent is not material. The important thing, both there and here, is that the conveyance was made under the diiection of the court having jurisdiction of a pending guardianship over the heir's estate. The guardianships were alike in point of congressional authorization and recognition, had like purposes, and were attended by like measures of control.
Plainly the proviso should be read in connection with the statutes whereby Congress authorized and recognized such guardianships and in the light of familiar rules of

construction. Upon such a reading it becomes reasonably certain that the proviso, although couched in general terms, is not intended to include a conveyance made by the guardian of a minor or incompetent heir pursuant to a sale directed and approved by the court having control of the guardianship of the. heir's estate.
The review which we have made of the federal restrictions shows that the guardian's sale was not a forbidden alienation under.any of them.
2. We come then to the contention respecting the ap-
plication of the state statutes of limitation. It proceeds on the assumption first, that the guardian's sale was in direct conflict with the federal restrictions on alienation; and, secondly, that the proceedings whereby the plaintiff was brought under guardianship as an incompetent, as also the later proceedings leading to the sale, were not in conformity with the state statutes and that these irregularities brought the sale in conflict with the restrictions.
We have already shown that the first assumption is not tenable. And we are of opinion- the second is illgrounded.
When Congress subjected Indian minors and incompetents and their estates to the laws of the State in respect of guardianships it did not thereby incorporate those laws into the federal restrictions. It merely gave its assent to their application to such Indians. The laws remained state laws, as before, and as such were to be applied to these Indians. Congress expressly imtosed a limitation fixing stated ages of majority for them. This, of course, put that matter beyond the reach of the state statutes, and the courts of the State have so ruled. Apart from this limitation and some others not material here, the state laws have the same application to Indian guardianships that they have when the wards are minors or incompetents of other races.

Whether the proceedings in such Indian guardianships conform to the state statutes is a question of state, not federal, law. And, in the absence of congressional provision to the contrary, the time and mode of seeking the correction of errors believed to- have been committed by the state courts in such proceedings, as also the effect of inaction in that regard, are all controlled by the state laws, as in the instance of other guardianship proceedings.
It follows from these considerations that, subject to a matter about to be considered, no federal statute or right was violated or infringed in applying the state statutes of limitation to this suit.
3. The remaining question is whether there was error in the ruling that the act of April 12, 1926, could not be given effect in this case without depriving the defendants of property contrary to the due process of law clause of the Constitution.
The defendants hold the rights transferred by the guardian's sale and deed. The deed was filed for record July 12, 1916, and the grantee then went into possession. The plaintiff had then attained his majority but was under guardianship as an incompetent. That disability and guardianship terminated August 4, 1917. The guardian's sale and deed were not challenged until April 11, 1928, when this suit was begum In the meantime any right the plaintiff may have had to challenge the sale and deed had become barred by § 1444 and subdivision 2 of § 100 of the state. statutes of limitation. The bar became effective July 12, 1921, if not August 4, 1920, in that under the operation of those statutes the guardian's sale and deed then ripened into an unassailable title.
Section 2 of the act of April 12, 1926, declares that"No cause of action which heretofore shall have accrued to" any restricted Indian of any of the Five Civilized Tribes "shall be barred prior to the expiration of a

period of two years from and after the approval of this Act, even though the full statutory period of limitation shall already have run or shall expire during said two years' period, and any such restricted Indian, if competent to sue, or his guardian, or the United States in his behalf, may sue upon any such cause of action during such two years' period free from any bar of the statutes of limitations."
We are of opinion that so much of the section as purports to free from any bar of the statutes of limitation a cause of action such as is here presented, notwithstanding the full period of limitation had run prior to the act's approval, falls nothing short of an attempt arbitrarily to take property from one having a perfect title and to subject it to an extinguished claim of another.
As respects suits to recover real or personal property where the right of action has been barred by a statute of limitations and a later act has attempted -to repeal or remove the bar after it became complete, the rule sustained by reason and preponderant authority is that the removing act cannot be given effect consistently with constitutional provisions forbidding a deprivation of property without due process of law.' "The reason is," as this Court has said, "that, by the law in existence before the repealing act, the property had become the defendant's. Both the legal title and the real ownership had become vested in him, and to give the act the effect of transferring this title to plaintiff, would be to deprive him of his property without due process of law." 10
The state court so ruled in this suit and we sustain that
ruling. Judgment affirmed.
